        <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
        <p>
          THE <hi>Country Conformist in his
            Reflections
            on Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet'<hi>s Book of the Unreasonableness
            of</hi>
          
          <hi>Separation,</hi> endeavours
            to excuse Mr.
            <hi>Baxter,</hi> from intending
            the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in that lewd
            Character he
            gave
            of <hi>a most unskilful, proud, partial, obstinate, cruel,
            impertinent Adversary,</hi>
            by making
            it <hi>the description of such Substitutes,
            as had
            neither the Candor
            nor Learning
            of the Doctor:</hi> However any impartial Reader will see
            cause to believe, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            had
            the Dean in his Eye, tho he had
            not courage to apply every thing to
            him,
            but left his Readers
            to apply as much as they pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          But suppose he meant
            this, <hi>of such Substitutes,
            as had
            neither the Candor nor Learning
            of the Doctor,</hi> I reckon a Man may fall many
            Degrees
            short of the Doctor, and yet not deserve such a
          
          
          
          Character, nor be unworthy of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s notice. As for
            the former I confess, a very great proportion of that
            is
            necessary for any Man, who will treat Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with any
            tolerable Civility, when in all his late
            Writings
            he casts
            so much Dirt upon the Church and
            Church-men;
            and this Author will not allow the Dean
            himself any great
            share of that, tho he has
            only very sparingly,
            considering
            the frequent Provocations,
            and very decently
            and modestly,
            considering
            the occasions
            he takes
            for it, rebuked
            that huffing
            Disputant. As for the latter, I
            acknowledg
            my self to be such a Substitute,
            as have not the Learning
            of the Doctor; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might well guess, that if
            he had
            any Substitutes
            at all, it was
            very likely he would have such Men:
            but yet a Man, who has
            not the Dean's Learning,
            having
            the advantage of the Ground he has
            gained,
            may easily
            defend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I sirst undertook
            this Defence, I designed
            no more than a short Rebuke
            to some such skulking
            Pamphleteers,
            as this <hi>Country Conformist,</hi> who do not fight with
            Mens Books,
            but with their Reputations;
            and have no other way of answering
            Arguments,
            but
          
          
          by picking
            up some By-Sayings,
            which with the help of an
            ingenious Comment
            may expose the Author, and then there
            is
            no need of answering
            his Book.
        </p>
        <p>For this Reason I began
          with <hi>the modest
          and peaceable Inquiry,</hi> which, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
          tells
          us, was
          writ by Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>search for
          the English Schismatick</hi>
          fell in my way, which I could not avoid
          considering,
          because I had
          a great mind to know him;
          and here I found, how necessary it
          was
          to state the true Notion
          of Church-Union, which drew
          me on to answer so much of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s
          <hi>Inquiry into
          the Original of Evangelical Churches;</hi>
          and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Second true defence of the
          meer
          Non-Conformists
          in Answer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> as fell
          within that compass,
          which are the most material things,
          they say; and thus I fortook my first Design, which therefore I
          must briefly
          reassume in this Preface, having
          not time now for such a particular
          Examination of these things,
          as I intended.</p>
        <p>
          I shall begin with the Reflecter, who writes himself <hi>a
            Conformist Minister in the Country;</hi> and this
            is
            the only considerable
            thing in it, that it is
            the Testimony
          
          
          
          of one of our own Church, against
            the Dean of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and for his
            Adversaries;
            and for that Reason Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the end of his
            Answer refers
            his Readers
            to him,
            that those <hi>may receive that from a Conformist, which they
            will not receive from such a one as he.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is
            this to the purpose? If there be some such
            Conformists
            among us now, as there were
            in 1643, who raised
            a Civil War, and pulled
            down Church and State to set up a
            Presbyterian
            Parity, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> assures
            us, that <hi>most of the Assembly
            of Divines
            were
            Conformists,</hi>
            and yet blessed
            Reformers.
            And such a Conformist our Reflecter
            is,
            who vindicates
            Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Parochial Episcopacy,
            which is
            nothing else but a new
          
          Name for Presbytery, as I have proved
            in the following
            Treatise. All the difference
            is,
            that they are willing to allow
            that Antichristian Office of <hi>Episcopi Episcoporum,</hi> to
            set a Bishop over Bishops,
            which Primitive Antiquity was
            a Stranger to; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            expresly
            condemns,
            and of which the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
            is
            the only great and perfect Example.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
          Nay our Conformist does
            plainly
            deride the Dean, for thinking
            he can justify our present Episcopacy. <hi>But the Doctor
            makes
            no question, but he shall</hi>
          
          <hi>confute this fanciful Man, and make it appear, that our
            present Episcopacy (which Mr.</hi> B.
            <hi>opposes)
            is
            agreeable to the Institution
            of Christ, and the best and most
            flourishing
            Churches;
            and easily
            he may, if Mr.</hi> B. <hi>be such a pitiful Antagonist.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          He pleads
            for taking
            off the Impositions,
          
          (in general without any limitation)
            to receive the Presbyterians
            again into our Church, which before he
            told
            us, <hi>were
            Subscriptions,
            Declarations,</hi>
            &amp;c.
          
          <hi>and some few alterations
            besides:</hi>
            that is
            either a Form of Prayer, or at least our present Liturgy,
            Ceremonies,
            and administration
            of Religious Offices.
            Now he is
            an
            admirable Conformist indeed, who at once
            grants
            away the Episcopal Office, and instead of it,
            sets
            up a Bishop in every Parish, and either
            an
            Atichristian Bishop of Bishops,
            or an
            Ecclesiastical Minister of State, to head and govern
            them;
            and alters
            the whole frame of our Worship, and into the Bargain
            leaves
            every Man to do as he lists,
            and all this without injuring
            our present Constitution: Nay
          
          
          
          he concludes,
            <hi>That all those that hinder</hi>
          
          <hi>the Union of Presbyterians
            with this Church, by continuing
            the Impositions,
            are Factors
            for the Pope, tho possibly
            they may do it ignorantly,
            at least many of them.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          He pleads
            for the Indulgence of others,
          
          particularly
            the Independents,
            <hi>who,</hi> he says,
            <hi>will be satisfied
            with their own Congregations,</hi>
            and is
            mightily
            taken
            with Mr. <hi>Humphry</hi>'s
            Project (for so Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            has
            taught
            us to call the Author of the peaceable Design) <hi>that the
            tolerated
            Churches</hi>
            (such as Independents)
          
          <hi>be declared
            parts
            of the National Church, whereof the King to be the Head.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          He will not indeed allow of Universal
            Toleration, tho other Sectaries
            make equal pretences
            to Conscience, and have the same
            Pleas
            for Indulgence:
            <hi>But what then?</hi> (says
            our Conformist)
            <hi>must all be equally
            indulged,
            or equally
            refused?
            A Man would think by this kind of
            arguing,
            that there are some besides
            the Non-Conformists,
            that are not the wisest
            Men
            in the World;</hi> Yes, Sir, no doubt, some such
            <hi>Country-Conformists.</hi>
            But in the mean time, how does
            he answer the
            Dean's Argument, that it is
            not the way to Peace and Union, and
          
          
          to silence Differences.
            <hi>For upon the Principles
            laid
            down by some of our dissenting
            Brethren, let the Constitution be
            made
            never so easy to themselves, yet others may make use of their
            Grounds,
            and carry on the Differences
            as high as ever; which will render all
            attempts
            of Union vain, and leave the same
            Weapons
            ready to be taken
            up by others.</hi> The Dean says
            nothing of
            tolerating
            one or other, but shews
            how unlikely it is,
            if Dissenters
            pursue those Principles,
            which they plead for their Separation now, ever to settle the
            Church in Peace, how easy
            soever the Constitution be made:
            our Conformist answers,
            <hi>he hopes,
            the Governours
            will be able to distinguish betwixt
            those that subvert the Christian
            Religion, and
            deny the Faith, and those that err in small
            things,
            and such as are consistent with Salvation; and that tho they
            may urge the same Arguments
            for their Liberty with better Men,
            yet they shall not have the same
            Concessions.</hi>
            Thus our Governours
            have already distinguish'd, and yet it
            has
            not put an
            end to our Controversies;
            and if they should distinguish
            once more, is
            he sure, that will do? Will not the
            excluded
            Parties
            cry as loud for Liberty of Conscience, and
          
          
          
          complain of Persecution, as they do now? Either these are good
            Arguments,
            or they are not; if they be, they will hold good in all
            Cases,
            that Men
            must not suffer for their Consciences,
            but be allowed
            the free exercise of Religion
            according
            to their own Perswasions;
            if they be not, let them
            leave off the pretences
            of Scruples,
            and tender Consciences,
            with that Liberty and Freedom
            in exercising
            their Religion, which they challenge as their natural
            Birth-Right, and demand no more of that than what the merit of
            their Cause requires.
            As for what he adds
            about the Difference between subverting
            Religion, and
            some smaller
            Errors,
            as a just Foundation for Liberty or Restraint; Suppose our
            Governours
            should think Schism as destructive to Religion, and the
            Souls
            of Men,
            as many Heresies
            are, it would be an
            unreasonable thing to desire them
            to establish Schism by a Law, and yet if they
            did
            think so, they would not be much
            mistaken
            in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is
            sufficient to satisfy any Man, what
            an
            admirable Conformist this is,
            who is
            either grosly
            ignorant of the Constitution of our Church, or a
            declared
          
          
          Enemy to it. And now no Man will wonder to observe his great
            partiality to
            Dissenters,
            and the different Judgment
            he passes
            upon the Dean and his Adversaries;
            where, if there be any difference in their Cause, the
            advantage
            is
            plainly
            on the Dean's side. The whole design of this Pamphlet,
            being
            to charge him
            with Pride and Haughtiness,
            with severe and unjust Reflections
            upon Dissenters;
            and to Apologize
            for their rude and barbarous way of
            treating
            so excellent a Person without any other Provocation, than a
            quiet and calm Discussion of the
            Principles
            of Separation.

        <p>
          The only thing he can fix on in the Dean's Sermon, <hi>as
            raking
            into old Sores,</hi>
          
          <hi>or looking
            back to the proceedings
            of former
            times,</hi>
            is
            one Passage, which was
            alledged
            by him
            as <hi>argumentum ad hominem,
            That they would not condemn others, for that which themselves
            have practised,
            and think to be lawful in their own
            Cases.</hi>
            And instances,
            <hi>in those out-crys
            against the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as Cruel and
            Tyrannical,
            for expecting
            and requiring
            Uniformity;
            and yet do not such Men
            even at this day contend for the Obligation of a Covenant,
            which binds
            Men
            to endeavour
          
          
          
          after Uniformity in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship?</hi>
            This I hope is
            not to rake into old Sores,
            when he appeals
            to their present Judgment
            and Practice, for which he need go no further than Mr.
            <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> But he
            adds,
            <hi>They want the Ingenuity of</hi> Adonibezek, <hi>to reflect
            on the Thumbs
            and Toes,
            which they have cut off from others, and think themselves
            bound
            to do it again, if it were
            in their Power: This</hi> (our Conformist
            tells
            us) <hi>in my Opinion is
            raking
            into old Sores,
            and looking
            back to the proceedings
            of former times.</hi>
            How tender are some Men!
            How often might I have read these
            Words,
            without taking
            them
            to be a History of former Times;
            wherein no
            things
            that were
            done,
            no Persons
            that did
            them,
            are once mentioned?
            And may we not desire Men
            to reflect upon what is
            past, to make them
            modest in their censures
            of present Affairs,
            without being
            thought to rake into old Sores?
            I would desire this Author honestly
            to tell me, what he thinks
            of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Historical Accounts
            of those times,
            which the Dean must not name, as he
            finds
            them
            lately
            published
            in his <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> But he
            adds,
            <hi>the Doctor is
            not satisfied
            with looking
            backward, but
          
          
          he will needs
            look forward too, and as if he were
            a searcher of Hearts,
            undertake to tell what some Men
            will do hereafter, if it happen to come into their Power.</hi>
            No, Sir, The Doctor pretends
            to no such Gift, he only concludes
            this from the Obligation of the Covenant, which they still
            plead for, which if it still oblige,
            obliges
            them
            to promote Uniformity
            in Worship, Doctrine and Discipline,
            which is
            nothing less than the Resurrection of the good Old Cause; and
            we have had
            sufficient Experience already to know what that
            means,
            without a Spirit of Prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is
            the sharpest
            Passage he can pick out of that Sermon, and what
            usage
            hath
            the Dean met
            with upon so little Provocation! Let any Man who
            has
            the Curiofity, and can find any
            diverting
            Entertainment in it, read over Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s, Mr.
            <hi>A</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Answers,
            to name no more, and he shall need no better
            Instructors
            in this Polemical Art. And yet when our Arbitrator
            comes
            to state the difference between
            them,
            he has
            an
            excuse at hand for Mr. B. <hi>I do confess he
            is
            a plain Man, and uses
            but</hi>
          
          <hi>little Ceremony or Courtship in his
            Writings;
            some Men
            have Humours
            and Ways
          
          
          
          of their own---which may be very
            easily
            conceded
            to them;
            but that he wrote
            his Book in a continued
            Fit of Anger, or that there are injurious, or spiteful
            Reflections
            in it, I do not believe, nor cannot find:</hi> (how blind
            Men
            are, when they will not see!) <hi>he
            hath
            a very quick and earnest
            temper of Mind, and his stile is
            very keen and pungent; but Spite and
            Anger are other
            things,
            and such as I believe Mr.</hi> B. <hi>a Stranger to.</hi> But
            now if Men
            revile and reproach without Spite and Anger, as much as other
            Men
            can do with it: <hi>If a quick and
            earnest
            temper of Mind, and a keen and pungent stile,</hi> make a Man
            guilty of as unjust Censures,
            and opprobrious Reflections,
            as the most envenomed
            Spirit, what satisfaction
            is
            this to the injured
            Person? Or who but such a kind Apologist could find the
            difference? Thus he Complements
            Mr. <hi>Humphrey's, pays
            him
            his hearty Thanks
            for his judicious Tractate;
            for besides,
            the Apology he hath
            made
            for himself, he hath
            done
            the learned</hi>
          
          <hi>Doctor and Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>a great deal of right, for
            he hath
            modestly
            and plainly
            rebuked
            the Pride and Haughtiness of the one, and
            given
            the other his due and deserved
            Praise:</hi> His Rebukes,
            I confess,
          
          
          are plain enough, how modest let
            others judge by a
            perusal of some few of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dean had
            called
            Mr. <hi>Alsop this learned
            Man,</hi> which was
            indeed, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> says,
            <hi>Ironically</hi>
            spoken,
            and which he makes
            <hi>an
            Indication what estimation he hath
            of himself in his contempt of others.</hi> But why so? Cannot
            he rebuke the pertness and folly of a
            trifling
            Scribler,
            who understands
            little more than Quibbles
            or Jests,
            without having
            a mighty Opinion of himself? Is
            it possible to
            make a more abusive Paraphrase upon such
            an
            Expression, than Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
            has
            done.
            <hi>It is
            all one in good earnest,
            as if he should more at large speak thus to his
            Readers;
            Readers,
            you may perhaps think that Mr.</hi> Alsop
            <hi>is
            a learned
            Man; but alass,
            what is
            he in comparison of me?</hi>
          
          <hi>I am
            the Man that have all Learning
            in me. 'Tis I have done
            such Feats,
            especially
            against the Papists.
            I am
            the Man that have killed
            the Philistine.</hi> This I confess
            is
            very modest, but it is
            hard that the Doctor cannot escape for
            writing
            against the Papists;
            were
            those Books
            as unseasonable too, as the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Sermon, to
            prevent Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s peaceable
            Design for the indulgence of Popish
          
          
          
          as well as Protestant Dissenters?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next Page, he quarrels
            with
          
          the Dean for <hi>pitying</hi>
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which he thus again
            expounds,
            that Mr. <hi>B. belike, is
            one scarce worthy of the Doctors
            Conquest, but
            fit for his Compassion:</hi> whereas the Doctor
            says
            no more, but <hi>that he pityed
            him
            to see him
            appear with so much Anger and Unbecoming
            Passion:</hi> which I should never have
            suspected
            as a sign of Contempt, but as an
            Argument of a great Mind, and generous Inclination, even to a
            peevish Adversary. Upon this Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
            is
            in great Wrath, and says,
            <hi>he hopes
            the Doctor is
            not so elated,
            as he is
            idle:</hi> very plain &amp; modest still! Then he
            runs
            a Comparison between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Dean, in defiance
            of the old Proverb: and thinks
            it no sign of Modesty in the Dean to compare with Mr. <hi>B.
            for a profound Divine (which one may think here he would be
            at) that he is
            one as well</hi>
          
          <hi>as others who may be willing to learn (or else he
            is
            sure he will have the more need to be
            taught)
            of that Man whom
            he pitties:</hi>
            That Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
            as much posed
            the Doctor, <hi>as ever any Boy in the
            higher
            Form at School, was
            posed
            by his Master.</hi> And here he
            triumphs
            over the Dean, as a Man, who has
            read Books
            indeed,
          
          
          but can go no farther than his Book
            Learning;
            <hi>if the Doctor had
            light upon</hi>
          
          <hi>it, in some of his Books;</hi>
            and a lit_le
            after, <hi>it
            is
            such a raw, injudicious, indigested
            Conception, as could never have once
            swum
            in the Thoughts
            of so learned
            a</hi>
          
          <hi>Person, if he had
            a faculty for beating
            out a Notion, so good as he has
            for Books,
            and negligence towards
            others, that endeavour it.</hi> Now how easy
            were
            it to make as insolent and haughty a Paraphrase for these
            Words,
            as he did
            for the Dean upon a much less Occasion? <hi>for it
            is
            all one in good earnest,
            as if he should more at large speak thus to his
            Readers:</hi>
            Reader, see here,
            how ignorant this great Schollar
            is,
            when you take him
            out of his Books;
            he knows
            nothing at all of the skill of <hi>Notion
            making:</hi>
            But I am
            the Man, who have not read indeed so much as he, but know how
            to <hi>beat out a Notion better:</hi> I can invent middle
            ways,
            faster than such dull Men
            as he can understand them,
            I can find out a constitutive Regent Head of the Church of
            <hi>England,</hi> when this great Church-Man
            did
            not know there was
            any, I can tell how by the vertue
            of an
            Act of Parliament, to turn all the
            Conventicles
            in <hi>England</hi> into one National
          
          
          
          Church; the truth is,
            I have found out a great many precious
            Notions,
            which never were
            in any Books
            before, and it is
            insufferable for a Man who can only read
            Books,
            or transcribe out of them,
            to neglect those who make them;
            <hi>and I do wonder</hi> (being
            so skilled
            in the art of reasoning
            my self) <hi>how a Man, whose parts
            are so great, should be so slender in his
            reasonings,
            and why he should undertake the resolution of such a</hi>
          
          <hi>point, as he is
            no Body at, at all;</hi> as he adds
            a little after. In another place he
            continues
            his Triumphs
            oversome pittiful
            Book-Notion he has
            found of the Dean's: <hi>That there
            is
            no necessity of a constitutive Head, because a National
            Consent makes
            a National Church,</hi> and talks
            it quite out of Countenance, and yet this Notion
            has
            been
            Fathered
            upon very ancient
            Notion-makers,
            who understood
            the Trade before our <hi>Notion-maker</hi>
            was
            born; but for all that, <hi>he pronounces
            it such a grave Nothing, such a
            speaking
            Nothing with Gravity, and</hi>
          
          <hi>pretence of being
            wiser
            than his Fellows,
            that if he do not come to be ashamed
            before Mr.</hi> B. <hi>has
            done
            with him,
            or has
            reason to be so, I will be exposed
            to shume my self for my speaking
            thus freely,
            plainly,
            and
          
          
          honestly,
            as another Person perhaps would not do.</hi> Well I have
            interposed
            for once between the Dean and Shame in this Controversy, and
            if he has
            any cause to be ashamed
            upon this Account, I will blush for
            him,
            and let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> prepare
            to do his part honestly,
            as he promises,
            if it fall to his share.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is
            the usage, which this great Man
            has
            met
            with from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> which our Country-Conformist
            calls
            <hi>a plain and modest Rebuke,</hi> and
            justifies
            it with equal Modesty in these Words;
            <hi>And truly
            a supercilious, haughty, Ironical</hi>
          
          <hi>Contempt of worthy and good
            Men,
            is
            so ill favoured
            a thing, that nothing but plain and
            unpolished
            Words
            are fit to rebuke it, and such a plain Rebuke
            is
            much more Christian and worthy of Religion, than
            an
            insolent despising,
            and trampling
            upon ones
            Adversaries,
            which the Doctor doth too too frequently
            in his Book.</hi> This is
            a good requital from a Church-man, for all that Contempt and
            Odium the Dean has
            so generously
            exposed
            himself to in the Defence of the Church of
            <hi>England.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet after all, if these Accusations
            be true, the Dean is
            very much to blame; and tho he has
            admirably
            defended
          
          
          
          the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet
            has
            not consulted
            his own Innocency and Reputation; let us then
            briefly
            examine what the
            Particulars
            are, whereon
            these Accusations
            are grounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          And our Reflecter begins
            with the
          
          Dean's <hi>pitying</hi>
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the Instance produced
            by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> which has
            been
            already
            considered.
            The next is
            founded
            on these Words:
            <hi>But whither will not some Mens indiscreet Zeal, and some
            of their own Fancies
            carry them,
            especially
            after forty years
            prescription?</hi> Our Author
            says,
            <hi>these last Words
            look somewhat scornful and sarcastical: Mr.</hi> B. <hi>belike
            is
            a Man of some Zeal, but of very little
            Understanding:
            he entertained
            some Fancies
            about forty years
            ago, concerning
            the unlawfulness of Diocesan Episcopacy, and
            believes
            them
            to this day upon Prescription.</hi>
            But may not Men
            of very good Understandings,
            be in some cases
            transported
            with an
            indiscreet Zeal? Does
            not that deserve the name of an
            indiscreet Zeal, which so plainly
            tends
            to blast the honour of our Reformation and
            Martyred
            Bishops,
            which is
            the case the Dean mentions?
            May not very wise
            and great Men,
            have some peculiar
            Fancies
            of their own? Or can
          
          
          he tell of many great Men,
            who were
            wholly
            free from them?
            Why should it then be thought <hi>scornful or sarcastical</hi>
            to charge Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with it,
            especially
            when the matter of Fact is
            evident? Unless it be a reproach to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be
            thought a Man, and subject to the
            weaknesses
            and imperfections
            of human Nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          His next Accusation is
            grounded
            on these Words:
            <hi>Not long after the same</hi>
          
          <hi>Author</hi> (Mr. <hi>B.) sets
            forth another Book with this Title; [The true and only way of
            Concord of all the Christian Churches]
            as tho he had
            been
            Christ's Plenipotentiary upon Earth, and
            were
            to set the Terms
            of Peace and Concord amongst all
            Christians.</hi>
            (he says)
            <hi>These Words
            are very haughty and full of Contempt!</hi> That I cannot see,
            they seem to charge Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with a very good Opinion
            of his own Performance;
            and I Confess, I know no Man, who
            has
            more plaid the Dictator in Religion in this last Age, than Mr.
            <hi>B.</hi> has
            done,
            and it is
            fit that he should know that it
            is
            taken
            notice of, and that his bare Authority
            is
            not sufficient to pull down one Church, not to set up another.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
          <hi>But is
            Mr.</hi> B. <hi>the only Man, that
            has
            proposed
            his Judgment
            and Opinion for the healing
            the Breaches
            and uniting
            the Churches
            of Christendom? Have not the</hi>
          
          <hi>great Pacificators
            at home and abroad done
            the same thing? and were
            they ever derided
            under the Notion of Christs Plenipotentiaries?
            Cannot a Person offer his judgment
            in this Case, but it must be entertained
            with scorn and derision, and he
            exposed
            as a vaporing
            Mountebank?</hi> I answer, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            is
            the first and the only Man, that ever I
            heard
            of, that undertook
            to determine <hi>the true and only way of Concord;</hi> other
            learned
            and excellent
            Persons,
            have modestly
            offered
            their Opinion in this case, and have
            interposed
            as Arbitrators,
            but no Man ever before passed
            a final and decretory Sentence, Thus it must be, and it cannot
            be otherwise; which is
            to act like a <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> which
            was
            all the Dean said;
            <hi>a vapouring
            Mountebank</hi> is
            the Reflecters,
            and I think is
            not the English of <hi>Plenipotentiary.</hi> But our Author
            proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi>The Doctor adds,
            the Book is
            fraught</hi>
          
          <hi>with such impracticable Notions,
            and dividing
            Principles,
            as tho his whole design had
            been
            to prove that there is
            no
          
          
          true way of Concord among Christians;
            for if there be no other than what he
            allows,
            all the Christian Churches
            in the World at this day are in a mighty mistake.</hi> What
            now is
            the fault of this, does
            this savour of Contempt and Scorn too? That I do not find he
            says;
            But only says,
            <hi>that the fundamental Principles
            of that Book are no other than the great
            Pacificators
            have laid
            down.</hi> I cannot stay now to dispute this point with
            him;
            but sure I am,
            I never found Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s fundamental
            Principles
            in a Pacificator yet. <hi>But the</hi>
          
          <hi>main Principles
            thereof are such, as are fitted
            for the attaining
            of as much Peace, as can reasonably
            be expected
            in this World:</hi> That is
            as much as can be desired,
            but what is
            that Peace? <hi>Union in Practice and
            Judgment
            is
            an
            idle expectation:
            Men
            will believe variously,
            and practise variously
            too.</hi> Now it is
            out, did
            not the Doctor say this, <hi>that the design
            seemed
            to be to prove that there is
            no true way of Concord among Christians.</hi>
            And this our Apologist confesses;
            for the true Concord of Churches
            is
            one Communion,
            and that cannot be had,
            while Men
            <hi>believe variously
            and practise variously.</hi>
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
          <hi>But the Doctor adds.
            When I looked</hi>
          
          <hi>into these two Books,
            and saw
            the design of them,
            I was
            mightily
            concerned
            and infinitely
            surprized,
            that a Person of his Reputation for Piety, of his Age, and
            Experience in the World, and such a lover of Peace as he
            had
            always
            professed
            himself, and one who tells
            the World so often of his dying,
            and of the day of Judgment,
            should think of leaving
            two such Fire-brands
            behind
            him.---</hi> Here our Reflecter
            villanously
            perverts
            the Dean's design, and represents
            him
            <hi>as scoffing
            at Mr.</hi> B. <hi>for telling
            the World of his dying
            and the day of Judgment.</hi>
            I will not attempt to vindicate the Dean from this Slander,
            which is
            too gross and notorious to find credit amongst his
            greatest
            Enemies.
            But <hi>these Books
            are Firebrands,</hi>
            so the Dean says,
            <hi>will appear to one, who duely
            considers
            them;</hi>
            and I shall leave the Proof at present upon that Trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi>But the Doctor will have Mr.</hi> B.
            <hi>resolved
            (or at least seem to be so) to leave his Life and Sting
            together in the Wounds
            of this Church: These,</hi> he says,
            <hi>are venemous
            Words,
            and not becoming
            this worthy
            Person.</hi> But are they true or false?
            Is
            not this the natural Interpretation of his
            Actions?
            if it be, why should he
          
          
          not be told
            so, and admonished
            by his dying,
            and the day of Judgment,
            to have a care, lest what he leaves
            behind him
            may make great additions
            to his Account, when he is
            removed
            off this Stage, and no longer
            able to redress the Mischiefs,
            which he has
            occasioned?
        </p>
        <p>This is
          sufficient to be returned
          in answer to our Conforming
          Reflecter; for what he discourses
          about the unseasonableness
          of the Dean's Sermon, is
          not worth considering;
          those who believe
          it necessary to give some check to a
          growing
          and boisterous Schism, will believe the Sermon very seasonable,
          whatever the Time, Place, or Auditory
          was;
          for necessity makes
          every thing seasonable, and if ever it
          was
          necessary to oppose Schism, it is
          at this Day. Those who are of our Author's Mind, that it
          is
          not necessary, that it is
          more desireable
          to try Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way, will never think it seasonable: and
          as for that dispute about Mr. <hi>A.</hi> it
          is
          so fully
          answered
          by the Dean already, that I see no need of
          adding
          any thing more.</p>
        <p>
          As for Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Answer, I have
            considered
            the Argument of it in
          
          
          
          the Body of my following
            Defence, and have now considered
            his civil usage of the Dean; and there
            is
            nothing more remains,
            than his Vindication of himself
            with reference to the <hi>peaceable
            Design.</hi> The
            Dean charged
            him,
            that in
          
          the first Edition of that Tractate in 1675, he
            granted
            toleration to Papists,
            as well as other Dissenters;
            in a new Edition of it in 1680, he
            denies
            them
            the liberty of such Toleration, because they
            were
            Idolaters,
            and only allows
            them
            the private exercise of their Religion.
            The reason of this Difference, the Dean
            supposes
            to be, that in 75, they were
            willing to consent to a Toleration,
            tho the Papists
            reaped
            the advantages
            of it, as well as themselves; but after the Plot
            was
            broke
            out, they thought it unseasonable to make such a Proposal:
            Does
            Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deny the matter
            of Fact? By no means,
            but owns
            it all. But answers
            four things.
        </p>
        <p n="1">
          1. That it is
            <hi>the Doctors
            mistake to lay a charge upon the Party; for it
            was
            drawn
            up by one Man, tho put out by others:</hi>
            But this is
            his Mistake, for the Doctor does
            not charge it upon the Party, but
            expresly
            owns,
            <hi>that some of the Presbyterians
            did
            not joyn
            with the
          
          
          Papists
            for a general Toleration,</hi> and
            produces
            this Instance only to shew,
            <hi>that this honour doth not belong
            universally
            to them.</hi>
            And yet it seems
            tho one Man drew
            it up, yet there were
            more than one consenting
            to the publishing
            of it.
        </p>
        <p n="2">2. He answers
          in short, for that this is
          the substance of it, that he would not justify Toleration
          without granting
          it to Papists,
          as well as other Dissenters.
          Which shews
          us what a blessed
          Doctrine Toleration is.</p>
        <p n="3">3. He says
          the reason of his altering
          that Passage in the second Edition,
          was,
          that some of his Brethren were
          offended
          at it. But how many these were,
          he doth not say; it is
          plain some of them
          were
          not, nor do we know the reason why others
          were
          offended,
          which possibly
          might be as much owing
          to publick
          Scandal, as to private Dissatisfaction.
          As much as they were
          offended
          at it, it was
          not altered
          till the second Impression five
          years
          after.</p>
        <p n="4">
          4. He will not own, that he has
            altered
            his Judgment
            in the second Impression
            of his Book, from what it was
            the first: But People know not Mens
            Judgments
            but by their Words,
            and
          
          
          
          the Words
            of his first and second Edition
            contain a very different and contrary
            Sence,
            which should suppose some alteration of his
            Judgment.

          Now if there be any difference between
            the publick
            and private exercise
          
          
          of Religion, here seems
            to be a plain alteration of his Opinion. But he
            says,
            <hi>He explains
            himself therefore by way of Supply,
            signifying
            that what he said
            at first,</hi>
          
          <hi>should be taken
            in regard to the tolerating
            the Papist only privately,
            as his meaning
            really
            was
            then, and is
            now but fuller expressed.</hi>
            We have no way to disprove him
            what his meaning
            was,
            but by his Words;
            and if they desired
            a publick
            Toleration for themselves, they
            did
            so for the Papists,
            who were
            <hi>to come under the like Toleration:</hi> And I think Mr.
            <hi>H.</hi> might as well have let it alone, unless he could
            have made
            a better Defence. And thus I dismiss
            him.
        </p>
        <p>It is
          time now to return to Mr. <hi>Lob's modest and peaceable
          Enquiry,</hi> a Title which I suppose he
          gave
          this Pamphlet by way of Prophecy; for though in it self
          considered,
          it is
          neither very modest,
          nor very peaceable, as you may see in my first Chapter, yet
          considering
          that rude and barbarous Usage the Dean
          has
          since met
          with from other Hands,
          I begin to think Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> a very cool and modest
          Adversary.</p>
        <p>
          The principal Design he manages,
            is
            to attack that part of the Dean's Preface, which
            concerns
            those Advantages
          
          
          
          the Papists
            make of our Divisions,
            and the boisterous and furious
          
          Zeal of our Dissenters
            against the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And to expose the Dean
            to popular Odium and Fury, he says
            <hi>it is
            evident, that the great end of his History, if not of the
            whole Book it self, is
            to represent dissenting
            Protestants
            to be but the Jesuits
            Instruments:</hi>
            Where, if by Instruments
            he means
            such as designedly
            promote a Popish Interest, nothing
            can be more false; but if he means
            such as by unreasonable Divisions,
            and an
            intemperate Zeal, give Advantages
            to the Papists
            to promote their own Cause, the Dean I confess
            does
            say it, and proves
            it too; and that for no other end, that I can perceive, but to
            reduce our Dissenters
            to sober Thoughts,
            that they who express such an
            Abhorrence of, and Antipathy against
            Popery, may take heed, lest they themselves bring it in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dean does
            not charge the Men,
            but the Nature and Tendency of their
            Actions
            with this Design, which is
            not to revile their Persons,
            (as Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> represent it) but to
            warn them;
            for I confess, I always
            made
            a great difference betwixt what
            Men
            did
          
          
          <hi>knowingly,
            or being
            deluded,</hi>
            till Dr. <hi>O.</hi> tells
            us, that <hi>it is
            all one;</hi> and if it be
          
          so, I must have worse thoughts
            of our Dissenters
            upon this account, than ever I had
            yet. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
            says,
            That some have reported
            <hi>the Non-conformists,
            some of them
            at least, do receive or have received
            Mony
            from the Papists,
            to act their Affairs,
            and promote their Interest,</hi> which he
            calls
            <hi>a putid Calumny, a malicious
            Falshood,
            afrontless Lie;</hi> now I confess I never
            heard
            of this Story, and do verily
            believe it to be false, if it be as the Doctor
            represents
            it, but possibly
            he may be mistaken
            in the Report; for if this Mony
            was
            given
            only to keep up their Hearts,
            and encourage their Separation,
            without any formal Contract to promote the Popish Interest any
            other
            ways,
            this might be thought a very
            useful Project: <hi>He avows,
            that never any Person in Authority, Dignity, or</hi>
          
          <hi>Power in the Nation, nor any that
            had
            any relation to publick
            Affairs,
            nor from them,
            Papist or Protestant, did
            once speak one Word to him,
            or advise with him,
            about any Indulgence or Toleration to be
            granted
            to Papists:</hi>
            But they might for all this do it about Toleration in general,
            and since he thought fit to take
          
          
          
          notice of that scandalous Report about some
            <hi>Non-conformist</hi>'s receiving
            Mony,
            why doth he not as avowedly
            clear himself
            from that too? I will only tell the Doctor, we live in a busy
            pragmatical Age, wherein Men
            meddle with such things,
            as do not concern them;
            and this makes
            some Men
            very inquisitive to know the reason, why a Fast
            was
            appointed
            by a certain Independent Pastor at that time on the Fifth of
            <hi>Nov.</hi> which we know is
            no Popish Festival.
        </p>
        <p>But to return to our Enquiry, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>
          reduces
          the Dean's Reasons
          (as he calls
          them)
          <hi>to engage the Reader to believe
          that the Dissenters
          are a People carrying
          on the Popish Designs,</hi>
          to six Heads.</p>
        <p n="1">
          1. <hi>The Dissenters
            have embraced
            the</hi>
          
          <hi>Jesuits
            Principles
            about spiritual Prayer, and a more pure way of Worship.</hi>
            Now I have read over the Dean's Preface very
            carefully,
            and can find no such thing urged
            against our Dissenters.
            All that Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> founds
            this Accusation on is,
            that
          
          the Dean says,
            <hi>it is
            not improbable that the Jesuits
            were
            the first setters
            up of spiritual Prayer in England.</hi> This
            is
            mighty falsly
            and imperfectly
            represented,
            and thefore
            it is
            necessary to acquaint my Reader with the true state
          
          
          of this Matter, which will prevent the trouble of this
            Dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dean says,
            that <hi>there are strong Probabilities,
            that the Jesuitical Party</hi>
          
          <hi>had
            a great influence on the very first
            beginnings
            of the Separation</hi> from the
            Reformed
            Church of <hi>England:</hi> this I hope
            is
            no Charge against the Dissenters,
            but the Jesuits;
            this the Dean proves,
            because for several Years
            in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, neither
            Papists
            nor Non-conformists
            made
            any Separation from the Church. But <hi>the more zealous
            Priests
            and Jesuits,
            fearing
            the Effect of such a Compliance, first
            drew
            off the secret Papists
            from all Conformity with our Church:</hi> and then
            attempted
            <hi>to draw off Protestants
            from the Communion of this Church too, under the pretence of
            greater
            Purity and Perfection.</hi> And one way they
            took
            to accomplish this, was
            by setting
            up the way of more spiritual
            Prayer, and greater
            Purity of Worship than is
            in the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
            which the Dean proves
            from very credible Testimonies
            concerning
            Persons
            so employed
            in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days;
            an
            account of which has
            been
            lately
            published,
            with great Authority in a little Pamphlet,
            called
            <hi>Foxes
            and
          
          
          
          Firebrands;</hi>
            so that <hi>de facto,</hi> the first
            Men,
            who cried
            down our Common-Prayer
            as a dull, formal, superstitious
            Worship, and nothing better than the Popish Mass-Book in
            <hi>English,</hi> and set up the way of spiritual, free,
            <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer in the room of it, to draw People
            from our Churches,
            were
            Jesuits,
            who professed
            to do it with this Design, to cause a
            Separation
            from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
            did
            effect what they designed,
            and the Separation is
            still kept
            up upon these Pretences,
            as we see at this day. And if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> would have
            said
            any thing to the purpose, he should have
            disproved
            these Stories,
            which he has
            not so much as mentioned
            in all his Pamphlet; and yet this
            is
            the only thing the Dean insists
            on, and confirms
            it with this Observation;
            That this way of free spiritual
          
          Prayer in publick
            was
            never known
            in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any
            other
            reformed
            Church before this time; and yet all that
            is
            passed
            over in silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dean indeed adds,
            that <hi>there is
            no improbability in the thing, if we
            consider</hi>
          
          <hi>the Suitableness of these Pretences
            about spiritual Prayer to the Doctrine and
          
          
          Practises
            of the Jesuits:
            For they are professed
            despisers
            of the Cathedral Service, and are
            excused
            from their Attendance on it by the
            Constitutions
            of their Order; and are great Admirers
            of spiritual Prayer, and an
            Enthusiastick
            way of preaching.</hi>
            Can Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> disprove this? no: But he
            says,
            (1.) <hi>The Jesuits
            are not for free</hi>
          
          <hi>Prayer in publick.</hi>
            What is
            that to the purpose? they will not allow
            <hi>publick
            free Prayer</hi> in their own Church, <hi>ergo,</hi> they
            did
            not set it up in ours;
            they will not suffer their Preachers
            to rail against the Mass-Book at <hi>Rome, ergo,</hi> they
            will not allow this neither at a Conventicle. When we say,
            that they brought
            in the use of <hi>Extempore</hi>
            Prayers
            in publick,
            we do not say, they did
            this, as a thing they thought allowable
            in publick,
            but as an
            excellent Contrivance to break, and divide our Church; and
            they may easily
            be presumed
            to do that in our Church, which they would not allow in their
            own.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he answers,
            (2.) <hi>That free Prayer
            is
            not the Jesuits
            Invention;</hi> or rather says,
            that the Dean suggests,
            <hi>that the Jesuits
            are for free Prayer in publick,
            and that free Prayer is
            the Jesuits
            Invention:</hi> whereas the Dean
            has
            not said
            any
          
          
          
          such thing, nor given
            the least Intimation
            of it; and yet he takes
            this occasion to
            slander the Dean <hi>with treating
            the holy Spirit at an
            indecent manner, by ascribing
            its
            work, namely spiritual Prayer, unto the
            Jesuits,
            as though such are the works
            of the Spirit, that they cannot
            be distinguished
            from the Invention of the Jesuit:</hi> But where
            does
            the Doctor do this? doth he speak at all of
            spiritual
            Prayer under any other notion, than as it
            is
            opposed
            to a form of Prayer?
            does
            he any where make free Prayer
            the first invention of Jesuits?
            If this free Prayer were
            the work of God's Spirit (which we are not
            concerned
            to dispute now) cannot we say, that the
            Jesuits
            brought
            free Prayer (which at best is
            fitter for our Closets,
            and private
            Devotions)
            into publick
            Use with an
            ill Intent, without reproaching
            the Spirit of God; there are no such
            malicious
            Slanders,
            as those which are begotten
            between Zeal and Ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is
            not to dispute, but to fence; not to answer
            Arguments,
            but to endeavour
            to lose them
            by diverting
            to another Question. The Dean proves,
            that the Jesuits
            had
            a great hand in the first biginnings of our Separation, and
          
          
          that the way they took
            to effect this, was
            by crying
            down Forms
            of Prayer, especially
            the English Liturgy, as no better than the Popish Mass-Book,
            and by setting
            up spiritual or free Prayer as a more pure way of Worship; Mr.
            <hi>Lob</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> take no notice at all of
            this, but fall a disputing
            about spiritual Prayer, what it
            is,
            and whether it
            were
            the Jesuits
            Invention; and I shall leave them
            to dispute this by themselves, for the present
            Controversy
            is
            not concerned
            in it.
        </p>

          2. According
            to his way of making
            Arguments
            for the Dean, he says
            his second Argument is,
            that <hi>the Dissenters</hi>
          
          <hi>have blasted
            the Reputation and Honour of the Reformation, which
            is
            the great thing the Jesuits
            would be at.</hi> Here every
            thing is
            misrepresented
            again; the Dean shows,
            how very advantageous it would be to the Popish Interest,
            <hi>to overthrow the Constitution of the Church of</hi>
            England; <hi>that nothing is
            more envied
            and maligned
            by the Papists
            than the Church of</hi> England; <hi>nothing they have more
            wished
            to see broken
            in pieces;
            nor have used
            more Arts
            or Instruments
            to destroy; that Protestant Bishops
            have been
            martyred
            by their means,
            who yet
          
          
          
          had
            the same Episcopacy, that is
            now among us, and
            which some now are so busy in seeking
            to destroy, by publishing
            one Book after another, on purpose to represent it as unlawful
            and inconsistent with the Primitive Institution;
            is
            all this done
            for the honour of our Reformation?
            is
            this the way to preserve the Protestant
            Religion among
            us, to fill Men's minds
            with such prejudices
            against the first settlement of it?</hi> &amp;c. So that the
            Dean's Argument
            is
            this: Our Dissenters
            in undermining
            the Constitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in
            blasting
            the Credit of the Reformation, do that, which of all
            things
            the Papists
            desire to see done,
            as the most effectual way to introduce Popery among us; <hi>I
            do not say</hi> (as the Dean adds)
            <hi>such Men
            are set on by the Jesuits,
            but I say they do their Work as
            effectually
            as if they were.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>To this Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> answers
          two things.</p>
        <p n="1">
          1. <hi>That the Papists
            do not so much</hi>
          
          <hi>envy and maligne
            the Episcopal Government,---neither
            is
            it their Principle nor Interest to destroy it,</hi> which he
            attempts
            particularly
            to prove; and though it is
            a Matter capable of a very easy Proof, yet he
            goes
            so oddly
            about it, as would tempt a Man to deny it, to try
          
          
          his skill in these matters.
            But I shall only shew
            how impertinent it is
            to the present Inquiry, and dismiss it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Papists
            (he says)
            are no Enemies
            to Episcopacy, but what then? may not they desire the
            destruction of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> will he be so
            hardy as to prove, that the Papists
            do not design to overthrow the Constitution
            of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King
            is
            no Enemy to Monarchy,
            and therefore he has
            no design upon the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor the Kingdom
            of <hi>Spain.</hi> What pity is
            it, the <hi>French</hi> King had
            not employed
            Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> to satisfy his Neighbour
            Princes,
            that he could have no design against
            them,
            because he is
            no Enemy to Monarchy,
            for it is
            against his Principles
            and Interest, that Monarchy should be
            destroyed?
            and yet I suspect his Neighbours
            would not have been
            thus satisfied,
            unless he could give them
            as plain a Demonstration, that it
            was
            neither his Principle nor Interest, to make himself
            an
            Universal Monarch. Thus it is
            neither the Principles
            nor Interest of the Jesuits
            to destroy Episcopacy (tho by the way they are none of the
            greatest
            Admirers
            of Episcopacy) but I suppose
          
          
          
          Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will not prove, that they have no mind to
            pull down a Protestant Episcopacy, and to set up a Popish
            Episcopacy in the room of it.
        </p>
        <p>The more they like Episcopacy in general, the more they
          dislike it in Protestants,
          as being
          the best constituted
          Government, the most easily
          defended
          against their Arguments,
          and the greatest
          Security, and the most impregnable
          Bulwark of the Protestant Cause.</p>
        <p n="2">2. He answers,
          <hi>The Reputation of the first Reformation
          is
          not hereby blasted,
          nor are the first Reformers
          in the least reproached.</hi></p>
        <p>
          For, 1. <hi>The memory of these
            Worthies
            is
            precious unto the Dissenters,
            who can distinguish between their Episcopacy, and their
            Martyrdom, they not being
            martyred
            for Episcopacy, but for renouncing
            Transubstantiation,</hi>
            &amp;c. This is
            what I said,
            that the Papists
            are not against Episcopacy, but against a Protestant
            Episcopacy. And these Martyrs
            were
            Bishops
            as well as Reformers,
            and exercised
            the same Episcopal Power and Jurisdiction, which our
            Bishops
            do at this day: and if this Office
            were
            Antichristian, and
          
          
          destructive of the Church-order of
            divine
            Institution, as our Dissenters
            generally
            say, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> endeavours
            to prove, then these Martyrs
            must be Antichristian Bishops,
            and yet their Memory precious to
            Dissenters,
            who now abhor the thoughts
            of such Antichristian Bishops.
            Thus I perceive Dissenters
            they are resolved
            to be, tho they must dissent from themselves, unless they like
            none but Martyr'd Bishops.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
          2. They honour Reformers
            for what they did
            do: <hi>It being
            a wonder, that in less than six
            Years
            time they should do more towards
            Reformation than all the Bishops
            in</hi> England <hi>besides
            have done
            in</hi>
          
          <hi>almost six-score Years;
            they went
            as far as possibly
            they could in that Juncture, and
            probably
            would have gone</hi>
            pari passu, <hi>with</hi> Luther, Calvin, <hi>&amp;c.
            had
            they Time and Opportunity.</hi> And yet after these good
            Words,
            what was
            it they did,
            which deserves
            so much Commendation?
          
          <hi>The Reformation of Doctrine and Worship,</hi>
            says
            Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
            Doctrine I confess in something; but how
            is
            our Worship reformed,
            when there remains
            such Corruptions
            still, as make a Separation
            necessary? that is
            a wonderful
          
          
          
          Reformation of a Church indeed, that
            leaves
            it still so corrupt, that it is
            not fit for Christian Communion! some
            Imperfections
            and Defects
            in a Reformation,
            are indeed tolerable in the beginning,
            and such Reformers
            may deserve their
            just Praises
            notwithstanding,
            which was
            the case of the first Liturgy
            in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Reign, which
            was
            afterwards
            more perfectly
            reformed;
            but when the very Foundations
            of a Reformation
            are rotten
            and corrupt, it is
            no great Credit either to the Reformers
            or to the Reformation; when the
            Reformation
            consisted
            in an
            Antichristian Monarchy, a Popish Mass-book
            turned
            into <hi>English,</hi> Popish Ceremonies,
            and Humane Sacraments,
            and such kind of Popish Trumpery, as it
            is
            unlawful for a good Christian to submit to. And as for Mr.
            <hi>Lob</hi>'s Conjecture, that
            probably
            they would have gone
            on had
            they had
            time and opportunity; what probability
            is
            there of this, when Arch-Bishop
            <hi>Cran_er</hi>
            at his Martyrdom,
            owned
            himself Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
            <hi>Ridley,</hi> owned
            himself Bishop of <hi>London?</hi> And at the second
            Reformation of the Liturgy, when they
            had
            opportunity enough, if they
          
          
          had
            intended
            any such thing, and perfected
            their Reformation with the most grave and deliberate Advice,
            having
            first consulted
            <hi>Bucer,</hi> and other foreign
            Divines,
            they left Episcopacy, Liturgy, Ceremonies,
            much as we now have them;
            and Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> who suffered
            Martyrdom, declares
            that the whole Church Service was
            so perfected
            in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s second Liturgy,
            <hi>according</hi>
          
          <hi>to the Rules
            of our Christian Religion
            in every behalf, that no Christian Conscience could be
            offended
            with any thing therein contained.</hi>
            Which does
            not make it probable, that they thought any further
            Reformation needful, especially
            considering
            that in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the Church
            enjoyed
            great Peace and Prosperity, and
            several
            Persons
            who fled
            in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days,
            and brought
            some out-landish Scruples
            home with them,
            to disturb the Peace of this Church, yet the wise
            learned,
            and holy Divines
            of those days,
            and the publick
            Wisdom and Authority of the whole Nation, thought fit not to
            make any new Reformation, but established
            the Church upon the old Foundations.

          3. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> adds,
            That <hi>William Nixon,
            in his Examination before the Bishop of</hi> London,
            <hi>An.</hi>
            1567. <hi>Says,
            that</hi> Ridley
            <hi>Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Taylor,
            <hi>did
            recant it</hi> (using
            the prescribed
            Garments)
            <hi>at their death</hi> Ridley <hi>acknowledged
            his Fault to</hi> Hooper, <hi>and when</hi>
          
          <hi>they would have put on the same Apparel upon
            him,
            he said
            they were
            abominable, and too fond for a Vice in a Play.</hi> It
            is
            true, <hi>Nixon</hi> did
            say so, but what Proof is
            this? The Bishop immediately
            asked
            him,
            <hi>Where find you that in the Book of
            Letters
            of the Martyrs?</hi>
            to which <hi>Hawkins</hi>
            replies,
            <hi>It may be shewed
            in the Monuments
            of the Church, that many which were
            burned
            in Q.</hi> Mary'<hi>s days,
            dyed
            for standing
            against Popery, as we now do.</hi> Which
            was
            no Answer to the Bishops
            Question, for indeed the Allegation
            was
            false. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Judgment
            we have already heard,
            and the Story of B. <hi>Ridley,</hi> and B. <hi>Hooper,</hi>
            is
            too well known
            to be here repeated,
            and he who wants
            an
            account of it, may find it already in Dr.

          4. He adds,
            <hi>That those very Persons,
            who were
            so zealous in Q.</hi> Elizabeth'<hi>s
            days
            for Episcopacy, were
            Persons
            of whom
            it is
            recorded,
            that in time of Persecution
          
          
          they were
            Men
            of the same Principles
            with Dissenters.</hi>
            But where is
            this recorded?
            Why he quotes
            Dr. <hi>Wy</hi>'s Letter for it,
            written,
            1570. and another Letter of <hi>A. G.</hi> to Mr.
            <hi>Coverdale.</hi> Admirable records!
            of the same Credit and Authority
            with <hi>Nixon:</hi> and I know not why Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s
            word should not be taken
            as well as theirs; especially
            since they produce no Authority for what they say. We have the
            same Records
            now, which they had
            then, and no such thing appears;
            and this Fiction is
            evidently
            confuted
            by the History of the Troubles
            of <hi>Francford,</hi>
            of which

            a Copy of a Letter from the Queen's Council to bespeak some
            favour to Dissenters
            in the execution
            of Laws
            against them;
            but to what purpose I cannot tell. The Queen and her Council
            were
            willing to mitigate
            the execution of Laws
            against some Dissenters,
            who did
            not separate, but condemned
            Separation, &amp; punish'd the <hi>Brownists,</hi>
            as they declare in their complaint, to which this Letter
            was
            an
            answer; therefore our Dissenters,
            who
          
          separate, do not blast the honour of the Reformation. However
            since this Letter
          
          
          
          is
            produced,
            I will give an
            answer to it, by transcribing
            part of Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi>'s Letter, as I find it
            recorded
            in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the
            Reformation;
          
          where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> also might have found, what he so
            injuriously
            charges
            the Doctor with leaving
            out, had
            he taken
            as much care in searching
            for it, as he does
            to pick up all little Stories
            right or wrong to asperse
            deserving
            Men.
        </p>
        <p>The Letter is
          to give an
          account of the Rules
          her Majesty observed
          in her Proceedings
          in Ecclesiastical Causes,
          both against Papists,
          and Reformers,
          as they named
          themselves; concerning
          the latter the account is
          this:</p>
        <p>
          <q>
            For the other Party which have been
              offensive to the State, tho in another
              degree, which named
              themselves
              Reformers,
              and we commonly
              call Puritans;
              this hath
              been
              the proceeding
              towards
              them:
              A great while when they inveighed
              against such abuses
              in the Church, as Pluralities,
              Non-residence, and the like, their Zeal
              was
              not condemned,
              tho their violence
              was
              sometime censured.
              When they refused
              the use of some Ceremonies,
              and Rites,
              as superstitious, they
            
            
            were
              tolerated
              with much connivancy
              and gentleness: yea, when they called
              in question the superiority of Bishops,
              and pretended
              to a Democracy
              in the Church; yet their propositions
              were
              here considered,
              and by contrary Writings
              debated
              and discussed.
              Yet all this while it was
              perceived,
              that their course was
              dangerous and
              very popular; as because Papistry
              was
              odious, it was
              ever in their Mouths,
              that they sought
              to purge the Church from the Reliques
              of Papistry: A thing acceptable to the People, who love ever
              to run from one extream
              to another.
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            Because multitude of Rogues,
              and Poverty was
              an
              Eye-sore, and a dislike to every Man; therefore they put
              into Peoples
              Heads,
              that if Discipline were
              planted,
              there should be no Vagabonds
              nor Beggars,
              a thing very plausible: and in like manner they
              promised
              the People many of the impossible
              Wonders
              of their Discipline; besides,
              they opened
              unto People a way to Government by their
              Consistory
              and Presbytery: a thing tho in consequence no less
              prejudicial to the Liberties
              of private Men,
              than to the
            
            
            
            Soveraignty
              of Princes;
              yet in first Shew
              very popular. Nevertheless, this, except it
              were
              in some few, that entred
              into extream
              Contempt, was
              born with, because they pretended
              in dutiful manner to make Propositions,
              and to leave it to the Providence of God, and the Authority
              of the Magistrate.

        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            But now of late years,
              when there issued
              from them
              that affirmed,
              The consent of the Magistrate was
              not to be attended;
              when under a pretence of a Confession to avoid Slander and
              Imputations,
              they combined
              themselves by <hi>Classes</hi>
              and <hi>Subscriptions;</hi>
              when they descended
              into that vile and base means
              of defacing
              the Government of the Church by ridiculous
              Pasquils;
              when they began
              to make many Subjects
              in doubt to take Oaths,
              which is
              one of the fundamental parts
              of Justice in this Land, and in all
              places;
              when they begun
              both to vaunt of their strength, and number of their
              Partizans,
              and Followers,
              and to use Comminations
              that their Cause would prevail through Uproar and Violence,
              then it appeared
              to be no more Zeal, no more Conscience, but
              meer
              Faction
            
            
            and Division; and therefore tho the State
              were
              compelled
              to hold somewhat
              a harder
              Hand to restrain them,
              than before; yet was
              it with as great Moderation, as the Peace of the State or
              Church could permit.

        </p>
        <p>
          This I suppose is
            a sufficient answer to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> But since he
            has
            brought
            us thus far out of our way, before I return, I shall upon this
            occasion make some Reflections
            upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s History
          
          of the case of the old Non-Conformists.
        </p>
        <p>The Dean had
          made
          it appear, that the old Non-Conformists
          condemned
          the Principles
          of Separation, if we may believe their own
          Words,
          quoted
          out of their own Writings:
          Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks
          to confute this by opposing
          that account which
          was
          given
          of them,
          by Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylen.</hi></p>
        <p>
          (1.) Now in the first place, has
            the Dean cited
            their Words
            truly
            or not? If he has,
            and they practised
            differently
            from their Principles,
            all that can be made
            of it is,
            that they are self condemned,
            as some Non-Conformists
            at this day are; which is
            no great Argument
            of tender Consciences.
            And I think Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was
            more concerned
            than
          
          
          
          the Dean, to reconcile their Principles
            with their Practices,
            or to have shown,
            how Men
            might write against Separation,
            and yet practise it themselves, or at least to have
            concealed
            the inconsistency
            of their Practice with their avowed
            Principles;
            which had
            been
            more for his own, and their Reputation, than to have
            alledged
            himself as an
            Example of such Self-contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But (2.) Wherein does
            this contrariety
            appear, between the account Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>
            gives
            of the old Non-Conformists,
            and that which Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
            gives?
            That, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks,
            is
            very evident: for Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his dangerous
            Positions,
            saith,
            <hi>That in</hi> Scotland <hi>it
            hath
            wrought
            more mischief in</hi>
          
          <hi>thirty years,
            than the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>had
            done
            before, I think in five hundred:</hi> But
            does
            he say, this mischief was
            Separation?
            otherwise he does
            not contradict
            the Dean.
        </p>
        <p><hi>In the second Book he taketh
          up what rash Words
          he could, from any indiscreet Men
          to make them
          odious:</hi> And does
          the Dean deny, that they used
          to talk and write Sedition, and Libel Church and State, or write
          holy Common-Wealths?</p>
        
        
        <p>
          In the third he saith,
            <hi>That the first ten or eleven
            years
            of the Queen's Reign they so clamoured,
            &amp;c.</hi> (that is
            a very convenient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if I
            am
            not mistaken)
            <hi>that they divided
            themselves from their ordinary
            Congregations,
            and meeting
            in Houses,
            Woods,
            and Fields,
            kept
            there disorderly and unlawful Conventicles.</hi>
            But does
            the Dean deny or conceal
          
          this? Does
            he not expresly
            own, that at this time they were
            a running
            into Separation, and how this was
            stop'd by <hi>Beza</hi>'s Authority, who
            expresly
            condemned
            it. Does
            he alledg
            any of these Men
            at this time writing
            against Separation?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Bishop adds,
            <hi>That they told
            the Parliament, that their Discipline
            was
            God's Order, and they must in Conscience speak for it: They
            erected
            a Presbytery at</hi> Wandsworth;
            <hi>drew
            up a Book of their Discipline; had
            their Classical, Provincial,
            Comitial Synods,
            and Government: That he gives
            an
            account of the resolves
            of their Synods
            about several parts
            of Discipline
            and Government:</hi> All this I grant
            is
            true, and yet all this was
            without Separation; as is
            evident from this, that these Men
            were
            all this while Ministers
            of several Parish Churches,
            and when
          
          
          
          a stop was
            put to that Separation, which at first
            began
            to break out, they resolved
            to set up their Discipline as privately
            as they could, without forsaking
            the Communion of the Church: and
            therefore
            formed
            themselves into Presbyteries,
            had
            their Classical and Provincial Synods,
            and as much as they could, exercised
            their Discipline in their Parishes,
            made
            their Church-Wardens
            their Elders,
            and accounted
            none of their Parishioners
            of their Church, but such as submitted
            to their Discipline. And I think, I need say no more to show,
            how Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s and Dr.
            <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s account of the
            Non-Conformists
            may be easily
            reconciled:
            and therefore their Judgment
            and Practice against Separation
            does
            still plainly
            condemn the present Separation.
        </p>
        <p>As for Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> I do not find the Dean at all
          insist on his Authority; but only
          refers
          to the Book published
          by him,
          containing
          an
          account of some Non-Conformists
          Judgments,
          in the point of Separation, written
          some years
          before: And if his Son thinks
          it matter of
          Reputation to his Father to represent
          him
          as a Schismatick;
          I know not how any Man is
          concerned
          in it.</p>
        
        
        <p>Having
          returned
          this short but full answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by the way, before
          I return to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> I will very
          briefly
          consider what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> says
          to this Objection,
          concerning
          that Reproach they cast upon the Reformation by their Separation
          from the Church of <hi>England.</hi></p>
        <p>
          He at first gives
            them
            very good Words
            too, as Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> did,
            but adds,
          
          <hi>We are not obliged
            to make what they did,
            and what they attained
            unto, and what they judged
            meet as to the Worship and Government of the Church, our
            absolute Rule:</hi> and takes
            some pains
            to prove this by six Arguments;
            now I know no Body that ever asserted
            it: and therefore here he disputes
            without an
            Adversary. But is
            there no difference between rectifying
            some Defects,
            (as he observes
            they themselves did
            in the review of
            their Liturgy in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
            days)
            and condemning
            the fundamental Constitution of a Church as
            setled
            and reformed
            by them?
            Is
            there no difference
            between saying
            they were
            infallible,
            and that it is
            a Sin to alter any thing they did;
            and utterly
            rejecting
            every thing they did
            with reference to Church Government, and the
            administration
          
          
          
          of Religious Offices,
            as unlawful for
            a Christian to submit to? A Church may alter
            its
            own Constitutions
            upon prudent Considerations,
            as the reason and circumstances
            of things
            vary: but to charge
            any Church with such fundamental
            Corruptions,
            as make its
            Communion unlawful, as those Men
            do, who separate from it, is
            to make it such a Reformation as must be
            essentially
            reformed,
            which I take to be no great credit to our first
            Reformers.
        </p>
        <p>And yet this is
          the sum of what Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
          pleads
          in this cause, as will appear from a particular review of what
          he says.</p>
        <p n="1">
          1. <hi>That they did
            not think themselves obliged,
            they did
            not think meet to abide within the
            bounds
            and limits
            of that Reformation
            of the Church, which had
            been
            attempted
            before them,
            by Men
            wise, learned,
            and holy even in this Nation.</hi> And he
            instances
            in the Reformation of <hi>Wickliffe
            and his Followers,
            in Testimony
            whereunto many suffered
            Martyrdom.</hi>
          
          But did
            <hi>Wickliffe</hi>
            ever attempt the modelling
            of a Church, or drawing
            up a body of Articles
            of Faith? He spake
            freely
            against some abuses
            in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
            is
            a different
            thing from reforming
            a Church
          
          
          in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship; and therefore it
            is
            no wonder, our Reformers
            did
            not confine themselves to his Platform of Reformation, when he
            had
            given
            none.
        </p>
        <p n="2">2. <hi>They</hi> (our first
          Reformers)
          <hi>did
          not at once make what they had
          done
          themselves to be
          a fixed
          Rule in these things;
          for themselves made
          alterations
          in the Service-Book which they first
          composed.</hi>
          They did
          so; but they did
          not alter, nor give any reason to suspect, that they thought
          there was
          any need of altering
          the main Principles
          of their Reformation.
          They still retained
          Episcopal Government,
          the use of a Liturgy, and Ceremonies,
          but cast out some Ceremonies
          of less Antiquity, and most liable
          to abuse, tho the People were
          most fond of them;
          the true reason of which we may read in the Preface to our
          Common Prayer-Book. And those blessed
          Martyrs
          thought that second review
          to have made
          the Reformation so perfect, that there
          was
          no need of any farther change.</p>
        <p n="3">
          3. <hi>The first Reformers,
            both Bishops
            and others, both those who underwent
            Martyrdom at home, and those who
            lived
            in Exile abroad, differed
            among themselves,
          
          
          
          in their Judgments
            and Apprehensions
            about those things,
            which are now under contest.</hi> What those
            Differences
            were,
            the Dean has
            explained
            more particularly,
            in his Preface, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
            takes
            no notice of. Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>
            scrupled
            wearing
            the Episcopal Habits,
            but soon submitted
            to that upon <hi>Bucer</hi>'s Letter, and such other
            Means,
            as were
            used
            for his Conviction: But surely,
            he did
            not think the Episcopal Office to be Antichristian, when he
            himself was
            a Bishop, and suffered
            Martyrdom without renouncing
            his Bishoprick:
            nor the use of Liturgies,
            nor all Ceremonies,
            without which in those days
            he could not officiate. The Troubles
            of <hi>Frankfort</hi>
            give an
            account of those Differences,
            which began
            abroad, which
            were
            quite of another nature from most of our present
            Disputes;
            they did
            not condemn Episcopacy,
            nor Liturgies,
            nor all Ceremonies,
            which are the great Quarrels
            now against our present Establishment.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
          4. <hi>They differed
            in these things
            from all other reformed
            Churches,
            with whom
            they did
            absolutely
            agree in Doctrine, and had
            the strictest
            communion in Faith and Love: These
            things,</hi>
            he says,
            <hi>were
            the
          
          
          stated
            Rule and Order of their Church.</hi> What
            is
            this? Was
            the Difference about
            a Form of Prayer? All the Forreign
            Churches
            retained
            this, and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> differs
            from them
            all in this Point even to this day.
            Was
            it about Ceremonies?
            The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church retained
            more than our Reformers
            did,
            and no other Church did
            absolutely
            condemn them.
            Was
            it then about Episcopacy? The <hi>Lutheran</hi>
            Churches
            came
            as near this as they could, in setting
            up their Superintendents,
            and neither <hi>Calvin</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi>
            condemned
            the Office as Antichristian; but would
            gladly
            have submitted
            to reformed
            Bishops:
            as the most learned
            Divines
            in the <hi>French</hi> Church at this day would.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
          5. <hi>In their Reformation they
            avowedly
            proposed
            a Rule and Measure unto themselves,
            which was
            both uncertain, and in many things
            apparently
            various, from the Original Rule of these
            things
            given
            by Christ and his Apostles,
            with the Practice of the first Churches.
            And this was
            the State and Example of the Church under the first Christian
            Emperors;
            as our Author
            confesseth.</hi>
            But what does
            the Dean confess? That they overlooked
            the Scripture, and the example of
          
          
          
          the first Churches,
            and followed
            only the pattern of the Church under the first Christian
            Emperors?
            Where does
            he in the least intimate any such thing? And would there be a
            better pattern for Reformation
            than the first Churches.
            whose example is
            the best exposition of the Scripture Rule, which otherwise in
            these matters
            every Man expounds
            according
            to his own Fancy? What Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
            thinks
            the fault of our Reformers,
            we take to be the great Glory of our Reformation, and
            an
            eternal Vindication
            of it, from the Cavils
            of our new Reformers.

        <p n="6">6. But they were
          <hi>newly
          delivered
          from horrid Darkness, met
          with great Oppositions
          and Difficulties.</hi>
          And therefore
          accommodated
          things,
          as much as safely
          they could, to the Inclinations
          of People. This is
          all his own surmize,
          confuted
          by the History of our Reformation,
          and signifies
          nothing, till he can shew
          us those Corruptions
          and Defects
          occasioned
          by such a compliance. But to return to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi></p>
        <p n="3">
          3. The third Argument he makes
            for the Dean, is
            this, <hi>The Dissenters
            oppose Episcopacy and Innocent Ceremonies,</hi>
          
          <hi>notwithstanding their Antiquity.</hi>
          
          
          What the Dean says,
            is
            only this, that it is
            great Temptation to People to be
            reconciled
            to Popery, when they find the universal Practice of the
            Ancient Church, (which had
            Episcopal Government,
            and significant Ceremonies)
            charged
            with Popery; for they will not think it credible, that the
            Primitive
            Church should so soon degenerate, without any notice
            taken
            of it by Friends
            or Enemies.
            What does
            our Inquirer answer to this? not one word, he never so much as
            taking
            notice, where the force of the Objection lay, but
            runs
            out into other Debates
            nothing to the
            purpose.

        <p>
          Eirst, He says,
            <hi>The non-embracing
            Episcopacy
            does
            not advantage the Papists;</hi>
            but it may do so, if People judg
            of the rest of Popery, by their
            rejecting
            Episcopacy as Popish. For when they find that Episcopacy
            has
            always
            been
            the Government used
            in the ancient Church (which Popish
            Priests
            may easily
            convince them
            of) and yet that it is
            rejected
            by our new Reformers
            under the notion of
            Popery, it may easily
            induce them
            to believe, that what they call by the odious name of Popery
            was
            the primitive practice, and then
            whatever
          
          
          
          our Author can say against the Authority of Antiquity, will
            not keep them
            from turning
            Papists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of his Answer consists
            in declaiming
            against Antiquity. 1. That he will allow no Antiquity but the
            Scriptures;
            nor do we allow any Antiquity
          
          which is
            contrary to the Scriptures;
            and we plead even the authority of Scripture both for
            Episcopacy, and the lawfull
            use of significant Ceremonies.
            2. That Antiquity at best is
            but a humane
            authority, and therefore no foundation
            for Faith. And yet without the Testimony of Antiquity, which
            conveys
            the Scriptures
            down to us, we can have no divine Faith, and why may we not
            then allow that a credible Witness of
            an
            Apostolical practice? 3. <hi>We have but a short account of
            the Transactions
            of the first three hundred years:</hi>
            But all the account we have is
            for Episcopacy and Ceremonies,
            and the Account is
            much larger
            too than I perceive this Author
            is
            aware of; and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
            who understands
            these things
            better, durst
            not admit the
            Testimony of the third Century. 4. <hi>'Tis certain that those
            Errors
            crept
            in gradually,
            the Iniquity being
            a Mystery, that began
            even in the Apostles
            days.</hi>
            But
          
          
          1. He must prove that the <hi>Iniquity</hi>
            was
            Episcopacy and Ceremonies,
            which is
            evidently
            false from the Apostles
            own account of it. 2. <hi>This Mystery of
            Iniquity,</hi>
            did
            not work in the Apostolical Churches,
            but among separating
            Hereticks,
            who were
            carefully
            noted
            and avoided
            by the Apostles
            and their successors;
            and therefore these Apostolical
            Churches,
            who yet retained
            Episcopal
            Government, and the use of significant
            Ceremonies,
            could no more be charged
            with this Mystery of Iniquity, than the Church of
            <hi>England</hi> can with all the
            Frenzies
            and Enthusiasms
            of Schismatical Dissenters.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he says,
            the Plea of Antiquity is
            the great Argument urged
            by the Papists,
          
          and he calls
            it <hi>Bellarmine's Thunder-bolt:</hi>
            This we grant, but I would ask our Author, whether the
            Papists
            can maintain their Ground upon this Plea of Antiquity? Bishop
            <hi>Jewel,</hi> when he made
            that famous Challenge, did
            not think they could; and he who
            finds
            how our Protestant Writers
            beat them
            at this Weapon, and make all their
            Thunder-bolts
            recoil upon themselves,
            will be of the same mind. Our Author
            had
            been
            an
            admirable Disputant
          
          
          
          against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who would have
            answered
            him
            in a word, by rejecting
            Antiquity, as a vain Plea; but our great
            Champions
            were
            so silly as not to think of this way; they
            allowed
            Antiquity to be
            a good Plea, but denied
            the Popish Pretences
            to Antiquity; that the early Authorities
            they insisted
            on, were
            counterfeit and spurious, and their latter
            Authorities
            had
            not Antiquity
            enough to prove a Primitive Practice; which
            is
            all that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
            means
            in those words
            he has
            cited
            from him;
            for that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
            never meant
            to reject Primitive Antiquity, is
            evident from his Demonstration
            of the Apostolical Institution of Episcopacy at the end of his
            Book, which I am
            willing to hope, our Inquirer
            never saw;
            for though Ignorance
            be a Fault in a censuring
            Inquirer, yet
            it is
            more pardonable than Knavery: The Demonstration Mr.
            <hi>Chillingworth</hi> deduces at large, and
            sums
            it up in these Words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi>Episcopal Government is
            acknowledged
            to have been
            received
            universally
            in the Church presently
            after the Apostles
            times.
            Between the Apostles
            times
            and this, presently
            after, there was
            not time enough
          
          
          for, nor possibility of so great
            an
            Alteration;
            and therefore there was
            no such Alteration
            as is
            pretended.
            And therefore Episcopacy
            being
            confessed
            to be so Ancient and Catholick,
            must be granted
            also to be Apostolick,</hi>
            quod erat demonstrandum.
        </p>
        <p>And I hope our Inquirer now will grow so <hi>modest,</hi> as
          not to cite Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
          any more against an
          Argument from
          Antiquity.</p>
        <p n="4">
          4. The next Argument he makes
            for the Dean, is
            this, <hi>Our Divisions
            give great Advantages
            to the Papists;</hi>
          
          <hi>and the Dissenters
            by their Separation, have caused
            the Division.</hi> The first part of this he
            acknowledges;
            what he answers
            to the second Part, who is
            the Divider, I have considered
            in the second Chapter of the Defence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for what he adds
            to prove,
          
          that it is
            against the Principles
            and Interest of
            the Dissenters
            to promote Popery,
            it is
            nothing to the purpose, for the Dean
            had
            no where charged
            them
            with such a design; only shews
            that the way they take is
            the effectual Course to bring it in.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that account he gives,
            of the Dean's <hi>falling
            in with</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>entertaining</hi>
          
          <hi>the same Principles,
            and arguing
          
          
          
          from the same Topicks</hi>
            with him
            is
            very pleasant.
        </p>
        <p n="1">1. That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Dean are both for
          Union; but I hope it is
          not the same Union they are for. Thus Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and
          Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> are both for Union, and so fall in with
          <hi>Bellarmine.</hi></p>
        <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and Dr.
          <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
          were
          both on the imposing
          side. But still it was
          not the same side, and thus our
          Dissenters
          fall in with <hi>Novatianus</hi>
          and <hi>Donatus,</hi> and other Ancient
          Schismaticks,
          who were
          on the opposing
          side,</p>
        <p n="3">
          3. <hi>The Doctor suggests
            the impossibility</hi>
          
          <hi>of a limited
            Toleration, and therefore his Objections
            are made
            against an
            universal and unlimited Toleration,</hi> as
            <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s
            are. The Dean shews,
            that upon the Principles
            now urged
            for Toleration it must be universal, and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>
            should have shown,
            where they might stop, without injuring
            the Arguments
            now urged
            for Toleration; but to say the Dean
            suggests
            a limited
            Toleration to be impossible, when he himself
            has
            given
            a platform of such a Toleration,
            does
            not become the pretended
            modesty of our
            Inquirer.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
          
          
          4. <hi>The Doctor asserts
            the danger of receding
            from the settled
            Constitution.</hi> Yes; unless it be
            done
            with great Care and Prudence, but he
            does
            not deny the lawfulness
            of such Alterations
            in some Cases;
            for he makes
            Proposals
            himself about it not indeed recede from
            setled
            Constitutions,
            but to make such Alterations
            as may consist with preserving
            the Constitution;
            which every one knows
            was
            not <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Doctrine, and
            therefore it
            is
            not worth the while to consider
            his parallel, which savours
            of so much Ignorance or Dishonesty, that no ordinary Reader,
            who will compare his Allegations,
            can be imposed
            on by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus that Calumny, That the Dean
            does
            his utmost to prevent a Protestant Union,
            deserves
            only to be scorned:
            He
          
          makes
            the Dean's opposing
            <hi>the alteration of some Penal
            Laws
            against Dissenters,
            to be an
            Opposition of an
            unlimited Toleration,</hi>
            and so he is
            against a Protestant Union: And to represent the thing
            odiously,
            calls
            <hi>a boundless Toleration, an
            indulging
            of Drunkenness, Swearing,
            Felony, Murder, Adultery;</hi> and
            hopes
            that Penal Laws
            against Dissenters
            may be taken
            away, without allowing
            a
          
          
          
          boundless Toleration. But I suppose Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>
            knew
            better things,
            that by an
            unlimited Toleration the Dean meant
            only a Toleration of all Opinions
            and Sects
            of Religion, in which sence
            it has
            been
            opposed
            by our Dissenters
            themselves, who when time was,
            would not tolerate the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor the
            Presbyterian Dissenters
            allow the Toleration of the Independents;
            and I would desire Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> to tell me, how
            an
            unlimited Toleration
            can be hindred
            without some Penal Laws,
            or whether to oppose an
            unlimited
            Toleration be to oppose a Protestant
            Union.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
          5. The Dean's fifth Argument, as he
            calls
            it, is;
            <hi>That the Dissenters
            accepted
            of his Majesties
            gracious Toleration, given
            them
            seven or eight Years
            ago.</hi> This is
          
          very modestly
            stated!
            The Dean shews
            what Advice has
            been
            given
            by the Jesuites
            to bring Popery again into <hi>England;</hi> the chief of
            which was
            a general
            Toleration to break us to pieces,
            which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> own'd,
            was
            obtained
            by a Popish Interest. This the Dissenters
            gladly
            complied
            with, notwithstanding the Advantage it
            gave
            to Popery, and wrote
            in the Defence
          
          
          of it, and justifyed
            the Toleration of Papists
            themselves. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> makes
            nothing of all
            this.
        </p>
        <p n="1">
          1. He cannot understand that a Toleration
            to Dissenters,
            unless Popery also be tolerated,
            can do any Mischief; as if dividing
            us, which was
            plainly
            the Effect and Design of the Toleration,
            would not weaken the Protestant Interest; as if
            Papists
            need any express
            Toleration, when Dissenters,
            without any
            exception, are tolerated;
            as if Jesuites
            could not easily
            creep into Conventicles,
            and seduce our People, and inflame our
            Divisions,
            when they are so publickly
            open for every body. But he says,
            the Knowledg
            of the Gospel
            encreases
            by Toleration, and that is
            the greatest
            Security against Popery. Knowledg
            I grant is,
            but I am
            much mistaken
            if a Liberty to all Sects
            and Factions
            of Religion be the true way to encrease
            true Knowledg.
            But he defies
            these Maxims
            of the Jesuites
            introducing
            Popery by a Toleration; to which I shall only answer, That
            wiser
            Men
            do'nt. <hi>But the Doctor suggests,
            that Jesuites
            might creep in under the notion of
            Dissenters;
            and cannot they rather slide into great
            Preferments
            under the covert of
          
          
          
          a Gown, a Cassock, a Surplice? The Temptation
            surely
            is
            greater,
            and the way much more easy.</hi> This
            is
            like his other Mistakes:
            A regular and well governed
            Society cannot be so easily
            imposed
            on; there are a great many Trials
            and Tests, which they cannot bear; they are
            accountable
            for their Doctrine and Actions
            by a certain Rule and Standard; and therefore cannot do that
            Mischief in the Church, which they can in a Conventicle: To
            get Preferments
            in the Church, how great a Temptation soever it may be,
            is
            not so likely a way to ruine
            the Church, as to draw away People from the Communion of it.

          2. He answers,
            as for their accepting
            the Toleration, it was
            only Gratitude
            to their Prince; and whoever is
            angry at it, <hi>yet 'tis the resolve of
            Protestant
            Dissenters
            to be ready on all Occasions
            to shew
            their Loyalty and Thankfulness
            to his Majesty for every instance of his Bounty
            towards
            his dissenting,
            but most dutiful and loving
            Subjects.</hi>
            I am
            glad to hear this with all my heart, and I wish this Fit of
            Loyalty and Gratitude, may continue: but suppose the King be
            not thus bountiful to them,
            can they be Loyal still? And what
            is
            all this to
          
          
          the Question, Whether their accepting
            such a Toleration was
            not the way to promote Popery?
        </p>
        <p n="3">3. He attempts
          to vindicate their writing
          in favour of the Toleration of Papists;
          but I think few People want an
          answer to this: For if it were
          justifiable to
          write for the Toleration of Papists,
          I suppose they think it very fit, they should be
          tolerated,
          and then who are the Men
          that promote Popery?</p>
        <p>
          His sixth Argument is
            a lewd Calumny,
            that the Dean charges
            them
            with promoting
            Popery, <hi>by an
            over-fierce opposing
            the Papists.</hi>
            He founds
            his Charge upon these Words:
            <hi>Now the</hi>
          
          <hi>Dissenters
            tack about, and strike in with the rage of the People, and
            none so fierce against Popery as they, whereby they marr a
            good Business by over-doing
            it.</hi> These last Words
            are added
            by Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> to make up the Dean's Argument for
            him,
            and the former are designed
            only to shew
            that wonderful alteration the discovery
            of the Plot made
            in them,
            who <hi>from trucking
            under-hand for toleration with the
            Papists,</hi>
            now on a sudden will not allow any one to be thought so hearty
            Enemies
            to Popery, as they. But I have wasted
            too much Time and
          
          
          
          Paper already in answering
            so mean a Pamphlet.
        </p>
        <p>And now I was
          in hope my Trouble had
          been
          over for this time, when there comes
          to my hand a little Pamphlet newly
          printed,
          called
          <hi>The History of Conformity, or, a proof of the mischief of
          Impositions.</hi>
          I have not time at present to give a particular answer to it,
          and indeed so far as I understand it, it
          needs
          but very little answer; and therefore I shall dismiss it only
          with some short Reflections
          upon its
          Design.</p>
        <p>In his Introduction he gives
          a short account of the Popish Designs,
          charges
          the severe Acts
          against Dissenters,
          and the universal Toleration as the
          Fruits
          of their Counsels;
          and adds,
          <hi>one would reasonably
          think, there should not be one Protestant in</hi> England,
          <hi>who should not think it high time for our
          Superiors
          to unite all Protestants.</hi>
          I am
          very much of his Mind, and declare that I know not a Man, who
          does
          not think so, unless they be among themselves, who have
          made
          use of this opportunity to assault the Church of
          <hi>England</hi> in the most rude and barbarous manner,
          without any new
          Provocation.</p>
        
        
        <p>What things
          he would have abated
          he does
          not say, but insinuates
          something about
          our Ceremonies
          and Common
          Prayer-Book, which he says
          were
          retained,
          and formed
          in this Method meerly
          <hi>to commend our Worship to the
          Papists,</hi>
          which yet has
          not attained
          its
          Effect.</p>
        <p>I grant this might be one, but not the only true Cause of it,
          and a very good Cause it was,
          and the reason of it holds
          to this day, not to retain any Popish
          Rites
          or Ceremonies
          to humour them,
          which our Church did
          not; but not to separate farther from
          them,
          or any other Church than necessity
          required,
          which is
          the true Principle of Catholick
          Union.</p>
        <p>The Dean had
          assigned
          three other Reasons
          of retaining
          those Ceremonies
          still in use among us, but he says,
          <hi>he had
          better have said
          nothing:</hi> Let us briefly
          examine the Reasons
          of such Confidence.</p>
        <p n="1">1. The Dean's first Reason
          was
          <hi>a due reverence to Antiquity;</hi> but he
          says,
          <hi>some will say, How have we reverenced
          Antiquity, in retaining
          three of their Ceremonies,
          and leaving
          out twenty more of greater
          Antiquity?</hi> I answer,</p>
        <p n="1">
          
          
          
          (1.) He will be much troubled
            to shew
            twenty more Ceremonies
            of greater
            Antiquity, than those we retain; however this Confession
            shews
            the unjustifiable
            peevishness of our Dissenters
            in scrupling
            the use of those Ceremonies,
            which were
            used
            in the Primitive Church, and in
            clamouring
            against a Church so much better
            reformed,
            than the Primitive Churches
            themselves were
            with respect to the number of their
            Ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p n="2">(2.) We know, when Ceremonies
          were
          multiplied
          in the Church, Wise Men
          in those days
          complained
          of it, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> did,
          tho the humour of the People was
          such, That they could not reform it. And therefore we reverence
          the Judgment
          of Antiquity, both in retaining
          some antient
          Ceremonies,
          and in lessening
          their Number.</p>
        <p n="3">(3.) There were
          a great many Ceremonies
          peculiar only to some particular
          Churches,
          others of a more general use in the
          Catholick
          Church; and it is
          easy to shew,
          that our Reformers
          had
          a special Regard to this in their
          Reformation;
          and it will be hard to name any
          Ceremonies
          of such a Catholick
          practice, as those retained
          in our Church.</p>
        <p n="2">
          
          
          2. The second Reason for retaining
            these Ceremonies,
            is,
            <hi>to manifest the Justice
            and Equity of the Reformation, to let the
            Papists
            see, we did
            not break Communion
            with them
            for things
            meerly
            indifferent.</hi>
            He answers,
            <hi>What need was
            there of our keeping
            two or three Ceremonies,
            to testify we did
            not differ from them
            for meer
            matters
            of indifferencie,
            when so many Books,
            so many Disputations,
            testified
            we differed
            from them
            because of their Idolatry
            in many things,
            and their Doctrine of Justification by
            Works.</hi>
            I answer, The reason of our Separation
            is
            as well discovered
            by our Practice as by our Disputes;
            and if we had
            separated
            farther than we had
            differed,
            it had
            been
            an
            unjustifiable and causeless Separation, and
            had
            given
            the Enemies
            great advantage
            against us, and might have hindred
            the Reformation, as the Dean shews,
            it did
            in <hi>France,</hi> from the Testimonies
            of <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Francis
            Baldwin</hi> in
            his Ecclesiastical Commentaries,
            and his answers
            to <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi>
        </p>
        <p n="3">
          3. The third Reason was,
            <hi>To shew
            our consent with other Protestant
            Churches,</hi>
            which he says,
            <hi>is
            of all the most weak;</hi> and yet
            is
            forc'd to acknowledg,
            that the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
            did
            retain the use of Ceremonies,
          
          
          
          but says,
            that they were
            imperfectly
            reformed,
            and had
            peculiar reasons
            for their retaining
            them,
            which with great reverence to those first
            Reformers
            he attributes
            to Pride and Emulation
            between <hi>Luther, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Carolostadius,</hi>
            and to the soft and easy temper of
            <hi>Melancton</hi>
            and <hi>Justus Jonas:</hi> and yet there
            is
            not any one Confession of the Reformed
            Churches,
            to the best of my remembrance, which
            condemns
            the use of significant Ceremonies.
            <hi>Bucer</hi>
            justifies
            those now retained
            by us, in that judgment
            he passed
            on the first Liturgy
            in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days;
            and in his excellent Letters
            to Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hooper, de re
            Vestiarra;</hi>
            and as the Dean has
            observed,
            <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Sadolet,
            declared,
            That he was
            for restoring
            the Face of the antient
            Church; and in his Book of the true way of Reformation,</hi>
            he saith,
            <hi>he would not contend about Ceremonies,
            not only those things
            which are for decency, but those which are Symbolical.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          As for his <hi>History of Conformity,</hi> he ought to have
            called
            it, <hi>a History of the Reformation,</hi> but he
            was
            sensible, that had
            been
            an
            odious Title, considering
            at what rate he has
            managed
            it; for his
          
          
          whole design is
            to cast Dirt upon our Reformers
            and Reformation in its
            several
            advances,
            under the name of Conformity
            and Impositions;
            for it seems
            this admirable Reformer would have
            had
            the Church setled
            without any Impositions,
            as he calls
            them,
            that is,
            without any
            standing
            Laws
            or Rules
            of Government
            and Worship, which all Persons
            should be obliged
            to submit to; which had
            been
            an
            effectual way to drive out Popery,
            considering
            how the People were
            at that time addicted
            to it. How partially
            he has
            related
            things,
            every Body, who
            is
            in any measure acquainted
            with the History of those times,
            will easily
            discover: And it is
            very happy, that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
            has
            so lately
            published
            his excellent History of the Reformation, which will convince
            all Men,
            with what grave and deliberate
            Advice and Counsel, and admirable Temper, that whole Affair
            was
            managed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should have been
            greatly
            out in guessing,
            what the design of this History
            had
            been,
            had
            I not found it declared
            in these Words.
            <hi>From this short and</hi>
          
          <hi>true account of the rise and growth and
            effects
            of these Impositions,
            a good account may be given
            of a late Authors
            History of
          
          
          
          Separation, the smallness of it at first, and the further
            increase and improvements
            of it, which indeed did
            much vary, according
            as Impositions
            varied
            and multiplied.</hi>
            Now two or three short Observations
            will evidently
            confute the whole design of
          
          this History.
        </p>
        <p n="1">
          1. That when the Impositions
            were
            greatest,
            there were
            no Non-Conformists
            but Papists.
            In the first Common Prayer-Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the
            <hi>6th</hi> there were
            a great many more Ceremonies
            retained,
            and of a more doubtful Nature,
            than now we have, and <hi>all Ministers
            enjoyned
            by the Statute to read those Prayers,
            and all the People to hear them,</hi>
            and yet then he confesses,
            <hi>there were
            no Non-Conformists
            to direct that Act against</hi>
          
          <hi>but only Papists.
            But upon the second
            Edition of the Common Prayer-Book</hi> (which
            was
            reformed
            much for the better,
            and many doubtful Ceremonies
            left out) <hi>there appeared
            a considerable Party who opposed
            themselves to it:</hi> And it is
            evident this Party grew
            for want of keeping
            Men
            close to the Rule; the scruples
            of <hi>Hooper,</hi> and that favour which
            was
            shewn
            to <hi>John a Lasco,</hi> and the remissness of Discipline,
            were
            the true Causes
            of it.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
          
          
          2. To satisfy these Scruples,
            the Liturgy
            was
            reformed
            again; but did
            that mend the matter? It did
            silence some Disputes,
            which were
            all soon ended
            here by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s coming
            to the Crown, who restored
            Popery again. Several of the Protestants
            fly beyond Seas:
            there our Author cannot pretend they
            were
            under any Impositions,
            and yet a Party of them
            at <hi>Frankford</hi>
            begin to quarrel about the <hi>English</hi> Service, and in
            those Forreign
            Churches,
            where they were
            under no Impositions,
            suck'd in those Notions
            of Discipline, and ways
            of Worship, as gave
            so much disturbance
            to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they
            returned:
            so that hitherto Liberty, not Impositions,
            made
            Dissenters.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
          3. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
            came
            to the Crown, the Reformed
            Religion was
            restored
            with very little alteration from King <hi>Edward</hi>'s second
            Reformation;
            those who fled
            in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days,
            returned,
            and many of them
            leavened
            with other Principles,
            than they carried
            away with them.
            For a time he says,
            <hi>No Subscription was
            required
            to</hi>
          
          <hi>any thing by any legal Authority, nor
            was
            the use of all the Common Prayer-Book, or
          
          
          
          an
            exact observance of the Ceremonies
            generally
            urged.</hi>
            So that thus far Impositions
            did
            not make Men
            Dissenters,
            but Liberty did;
            for by this Favour and Indulgence Nonconformity
            encreased,
            and Men
            began
            to innovate every where, to abound with
            Scruples,
            to decry Ceremonies
            and Forms
            of Prayer, to decry Episcopacy, and to set up a Presbyterian
            Parity and Government; and yet he
            confesses
            all this while <hi>very few Men
            were
            Sufferers.
            But the body of the Nonconforming
            Ministers
            and People were
            much quiet, until not only Arch-Bishop</hi> Parker
            <hi>was
            dead, but Bishop</hi> Grindal <hi>also, who
            succeeded
            him,
            who died
            about 1583, about the</hi> 25th <hi>of the Queen.</hi> Which
            is
            so plain a Confutation
            out of his own mouth of his History of Conformity, that
            nothing could be more; for in this time it
            was
            of Liberty and Indulgence, that they so
            propagated
            their Faction, and grew
            so insolent as to threaten
            both Church and State. This made
            the Queen take new measures,
            and keep a stricter
            hand over them,
            and exact Oaths
            and Subscriptions,
            and make severe Laws
            against
            them,
            as Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi>
            relates
            the Matter, as I before observ'd;
          
          
          and I can assure him,
            this did
            not make new Dissenters,
            but reclaimed
            many old ones.
            King <hi>James</hi> from his own Experience of the factious
            restless Humour of
            those People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from the Experience of
            the Queen here, pursued
            the same Method, and kept
            them
            in good order; and so did
            King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, till necessity of
            Affairs
            forced
            him
            to such Concessions,
            as at last cost him
            his Head. And how they have encreased
            of late Years,
            he himself has
            informed
            us, by severe Laws
            made
            against
            them,
            and Liberty and Indulgence
            granted
            them,
            as the Fruits
            of Popish Counsels.
            From whence it evidently
            appears
            that not Impositions
            and forceable Restraints,
            but Connivance and Liberty, which
            gave
            scope to the wanton and giddy Fancies
            of Men,
            were
            the true Causes
            at least of the Increase
            os Dissenters,
            and therefore his Argument for Union,
            founded
            on this Mistake, must fall with it. To
            conclude all, I
            shall only observe how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr.
            <hi>Humphrey</hi> have adorned
            their Title Pages,
            with suitable places
            of Scripture; for such Men
            seldom reproach
            but in Scripture-language, which
            sanctifies
            the lewdest
            Insinuations.
            Mr.
          
          
          
          <hi>B</hi>'s Text is,
            1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5, 6. <hi>Perverse
            disputings
            of Men
            of corrupt Minds,
            and destitute of the Truth, supposing
            that Gain is
            Godliness, from such withdraw thy self.</hi> Which
            is
            charitably
            hinted,
            as a Character of such perverse
            Disputers
            as the Dean and his Substitutes,
            and all Church-men,
            who must be supposed
            to conform only for rich Preferments.
            Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s is
            this, <hi>Against whom
            hast
            thou exalted
            thy Voice, and lifted
            up thy self on high?</hi> What he
            means
            by it, every Man must understand, who
            reads
            his Pamphlet, the whole design of which,
            is
            to represent the Dean as a vain, proud, haughty Writer, and
            yet nothing at all in comparison to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I
            doubt such an
            Application as this has
            something of
            Profaneness or Blasphemy in it.

              wondring
              Humour as is
              common to those
              men
              who are either ignorant
              themselves, or have a mind to
            
            
            
            impose upon those who are, I shall
              wholly
              pass it over, or if any thing appear
              material in it, I shall bring it in
              its
              proper place; and therefore, without
              any other Introduction, I shall first consider the Title,
              and then examine the Inquiry it self.
          </p>
          <p>The Title is,
            <hi>A Modest and Peaceable
            Inquiry into the Design and Nature of some of those Historical
            Mistakes
            that are found in</hi> Dr. Stillingfleet'<hi>s Preface to his
            Unreasonableness of Separation.</hi> I find some
            men
            use a great deal of Art in prefixing
            a specious and flattering
            Title, to their Books,
            which serves
            as well as a Bush and a painted
            Sign to invite Customers;
            but then the Title and Book seldom have any relation to each
            other; and thus it is
            with our Author, unless he understands
            these words
            <hi>modest and peaceable,</hi> and <hi>historical
            Mistakes,</hi>
            in some other Sense, than what they bear in common Use.</p>
          <p>
            For, first, let us consider how modest this <hi>Inquiry</hi>
              is,
              and I confess, there are some passages
              very modest in it, but others, which do not so well deserve
              that Character. He begins
              his Epistle to the <hi>Dean,</hi> with
              observing,
              how industrious
              the Papists
              have been
              ever
            
            
            since the Reformation, to <hi>ruine</hi>
              England,
              <hi>and the Churches
              of Christ in it;</hi> which he sufficiently
              proves
              from <hi>their Rebellions
              and Insurrections
              in King</hi> Edward's
              <hi>days,
              the</hi> Spanish <hi>Armado in Queen</hi> Elizabeth's,
              <hi>the Gun-powder Treason in King</hi> James's <hi>&amp;c.
              and the late Hellish Conspiracy, which
              was
              designed
              for the utter
              Extirpation of the Protestant Religion, and the universal
              Destruction of all the Professors
              thereof, whether Episcopal or Dissenter.</hi> But this
              modest man takes
              no notice, that King and Kingdom, Church and State, have
              been
              once ruined
              already by such modest Dissenters,
              and may be in a fair way for it again, if we suffer our
              selves
              to be charmed
              and lulled
              asleep by such modest <hi>Inquirers:</hi>
              We are aware Sir, what a Popish Zeal would do, and what a
              Factious Zeal has
              done,
              and think ourselves
              concerned,
              as much as we can, to countermine
              the Designs
              of both: but however,
              I confess it was
              very modestly
              done
              to pass over this, that while men
              are zealous against Popery, they may fear no danger from any
              other Quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was
              very <hi>modestly</hi>
              done
              to charge the <hi>Dean</hi> with
              designing
              <hi>to gratifie
              the
            
            
            
            Roman Faction, by acting
              so sutably
              to the</hi>
            
            <hi>Jesuits
              Measures,
              as discovered
              by Mr.</hi> Dugdale <hi>and some others, which
              is
              to revile the
              Dissenters,
              as the Dr. hath
              done,</hi>
              &amp;c. And at the same time, to laugh at the
              Jesuits
              and <hi>Coleman,</hi> their Instrument,
            
            as great Fools
              for designing
              to bring in Popery, by the Toleration of
              Fanaticks;
              for, you must know, that they themselves press hard for a
              Toleration,
              but would not be thought hereby to
              gratifie
              the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction, and to design the
              bringing
              in of Popery, according
              to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s and the
              Jesuits
              Method. But, yet it was
              not very modestly
              done,
              to charge the Dr. with <hi>reviling
              Dissenters,</hi>
              unless by reviling,
              he means,
              confuting
              them;
              and I dare assure
              him,
              that does
              not gratifie
              the <hi>Roman</hi>
              Faction, nor does
              Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> nor any one else, say that the
              Jesuits
              took
              these measures
              of promoting
              Popery, by confuting
              Fanaticism: if they had,
              I would venture to say, that they
              were
              much more mistaken
              in this, than in those other measures
              they take, of doing
              it by a Toleration.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it neither savours
              of Modesty nor any great disposition to peace, to
              insinuate,
              as he does
              in this place, that the
            
            
            <hi>Dean,</hi> by convincing
              them
              of the sinfulness
              of Separation, endeavoured
              to put a <hi>Sham Plot</hi> upon
              them,
              and to expose his <hi>Majesties-loyal
              Subjects</hi>
              (great Modesty
              still) <hi>to the merciless Cruelty of bloody
              Papists,</hi>
              unless he thinks,
              that Presbyterians,
              Dissenters,
              and Plotters,
              are equivolent Terms;
              and then the Dean's design was
              plainly
              to deliver them
              from the least Suspition
              of Plots,
              by endeavouring
              to make them
              true Church-men
              and Loyal Subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            He makes
              the <hi>Dean</hi> to represent <hi>dissenting
              Protestants
              to be the Jesuits
              Instruments</hi>
            
            to bring in Popery, in which he
              abuses
              the <hi>Dean;</hi> unless, by <hi>Instruments,</hi>
              he mean such Tools
              as are made
              use of by cunning Artists,
              to do that which they themselves do not understand. Such
              kind of passive Tools
              we confess they are, for they do the
              Papists
              work for them,
              though (as we charitably
              believe)
              without knowing
              that they do so; and this is
              all that the <hi>Dean</hi> ever
              asserted,
              that their Divisions
              and Separations
              were
              a great inlet to Popery, and fomented
              by the Papists
              for that end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now from hence he draws
              a very modest and peaceable Inference, that
            
            
            
            the <hi>Dean</hi> represents
              them
              to <hi>be men,
              not worthy of any savour from a Protestant Prince, for
              surely
              such are the Jesuits
              Engines.</hi>
              Now, this being
              his own Comment
              upon the Text, I would desire him
              to consider how to answer it against the next Time; for it
              is
              evident, the <hi>Dean</hi> did
              not think so, when he made
              so many kind Proposals
              for their Satisfaction,
              nor did
              our Author believe, he did;
              but out of great Modesty and Peaceableness,
              endeavoured
              to perswade
              the People that he did,
              whose good Opinion and Favour, I perceive, he
              prefers
              before the favour of any Protestant
              Prince.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was
              a very <hi>peaceable design</hi> to
              perswade
              the people never to look into the <hi>Dean</hi>'s book, or
              to stone him,
              as an
              implacable Enemy to all <hi>Loyal
              Dissenters:</hi>
              but the next device is
              better than this, to complain to the Parliament of
              him,
              as a man who disparages
              Their Wisdom,
              and casts
              bones
              of Contention into
              their House (such Crimes
              as these, <hi>Loyal Dissenters</hi>
              are never guilty of, when Parliaments
              please them)
              for so among his Conjectures
              at the Doctors
              end and design in all this, he thinks
              it hard to determine, <hi>Whether it
              was
              to cast
            
            
            Contempt on the Wisdom of the Parliament,
              who entertain other Sentiments
              concerning
              the Dissenters,
              or whether it be to cast a Bone of Contention into the
              Parliament
              House,</hi> (the Supposition of which,
            
            seems
              to me, to argue no great opinion of the Wisdom of the
              Parliament) <hi>thereby
              to prevent the uniting
              and strengthning
              the Protestant Interest, as well for
              diverting
              the House from these other Methods,
              which are most necessary</hi> (that, Sir, you should leave
              to the Wisdom of the Parliament,
              who, I perceive will not please you long, unless they
              chuse
              your most necessary Methods)
              <hi>for the impeding
              the future growth of Popery?</hi> And thus the <hi>Dean</hi>
              after all his Triumphs
              over Popery,
              is
              grown,
              on a sudden, a great Friend to it, by
              endeavouring
              to divert the Parliament from those
              Methods,
              which are most necessary to suppress it; <hi>Or whether to
              raise one of the severest
              Persecutions
              against that loyal and truly
              Protestant Party,</hi> (excepting
              the matter of <hi>Uriah) which cannot be
              weakned
              or impoverished,
              but to the advancing
              of Papal Designs.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            If these be not <hi>modest and peaceaable
              Inquiries,</hi>
              I will give you one more,
            
            where he very ingeniously
              insinuates
              the most effectual way to keep out
              Popery
            
            
            
            for ever, by pulling
              down the Bishops,
              and distributing
              their Lands
              among the Nobility and Gentry: <hi>Since the Destruction of
              Episcopacy may be attended
              with the Royal Distribution of Church
              Lands
              among our Nobility and Gentry, than which a
              greater
              Blow cannot be
              given
              to the Papal Interest in</hi> England,
              <hi>as appears
              by the Heroick
              Actings
              of</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth
              in a like case.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>This indeed is
            home to the Business, and a very <hi>modest and peaceable</hi>
            Proposal; for
            though he brings
            it in only to shew
            how much it is
            against the Interest
            of Papists
            to pull down the <hi>English</hi>
            Episcopacy, of which, more hereafter;
            yet he so highly
            commends
            it, from the heroick
            Example of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
            Eighth,
            and as the greatest
            Blow that can be given
            to the papal Interest, that he must be very dull, who
            does
            not understand
            his meaning.</p>
          <p>For, in short, it is
            an
            admirable Address
            to Lords
            and Commons,
            to pull down Bishops,
            and divide their Lands,
            which is
            a very <hi>peaceable and uniting
            design;</hi> but
            then it insinuates
            such Scurvy Reflexions
            on the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> that,
            had
            it not been
            writ by a <hi>Loyal Dissenter,</hi> it might have
            been
            liable to ill constructions.</p>
          
          
          <p>For it supposes,
            that there is
            no such security of their zeal against Popery, as their
            having
            a good share of the Church Lands;
            that is,
            that they do not so much value their Religion, as a good
            Estate. That they are men
            who may be tempted
            to pull down an
            Excellent Church, in hope to make a prey of it: or else this
            Writer is
            none of the wisest
            nor modestest
            men
            to make such a motion.</p>
          <p>And yet never any thing was
            more foolishly
            proposed;
            for, is
            it not an
            admirable
            reason for pulling
            down Protestant
            Bishops
            to keep out Popery, because
            <hi>H.</hi> 8, pulled
            down Popish Abbies
            and Monasteries,
            which were
            the Nurseries
            of lewd People, the Pope's sworn
            Vassals,
            and the Seminaries
            of Superstition
            and Rebellion? this is
            such a method of
            rooting
            out Popery, as was
            never thought on by
            any of our Protestant
            Princes
            (for I do not speak of the <hi>Loyal and
            truly
            Protestant Party)</hi> who, instead of
            pulling
            down Bishops,
            erected
            several new Bishopricks
            and Collegiate Churches
            out of the Ruines
            of Popish Monasteries.</p>
          <p>
            And there is
              another thing, I doubt, may deter our Nobility and Gentry
              from such a Design, that when Episcopacy
            
            
            
            was
              pulled
              down, and the Church Lands
              sold
              by the <hi>Loyal and truly
              Protestant
              Party,</hi> the Crown Lands
              and most of their own Estates
              were
              sold
              with them.
          </p>
          <p>And another thing is
            to be considered,
            whether, if ever such a distribution of Church
            Lands,
            <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should come to be
            made
            a second time, the old Purchasers,
            who are as <hi>Loyal and true Protestants</hi>
            as any men,
            would not claim an
            old Right, and so our present Nobility and Gentry lose the
            Reward of their Zeal? These are untoward
            Objections
            and Scruples,
            which our <hi>Modest and Peaceable Inquirer</hi>
            is
            concerned
            to remove, if he
            hope this Proposal should take.</p>
          <p>I shall give but one Instance more at present, of the great
            <hi>Modesty and Peaceableness
            of this Inquirer;</hi> for to take
            notice of every
            thing would be endless, his whole <hi>Pamphlet</hi>
            being
            the most perfect and exact Pattern of true
            <hi>Fanatick
            Modesty and
            Peaceableness.</hi></p>
          <p>
            He tells
              us, <hi>the whole of the Controversie</hi>
            
            <hi>is
              this, Whose Honour is
              mostly
              to be valued,
              that of the Episcopal Clergy, or that of our Lord Jesus
              Christ? for the Episcopal cannot make any
              abatements
              of these indifferent
            
            
            things
              consistent with their Honour;
              they have once imposed
              these things,
              as terms
              of Union, and cannot now honourably
              recede the least Iota.</hi> This he
              urges
              again, <hi>p.</hi> 23. and refers
              his Reader to <hi>p.</hi> 89. of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s
              Preface, part of which he there
              transcribes,
              but I shall transcribe the whole, and leave all
              men
              to judge of the <hi>Modesty</hi> of the man. <hi>We do
              heartily
              and sincerely
              desire Union</hi>
            
            <hi>with our Brethren, if it may be
              had
              on just and reasonable terms;
              but they must not think that we will give up the Cause of
              the Church for it, so far as to condemn
              its
              Constitution,
              or make the Ceremonies
              unlawful, which have hitherto been
              observed
              and practised
              in it: if any Expedient can be found out for the ease of
              other mens Consciences,
              without reflecting
              on our own; if they can be taken
              in without reproach or dishonour to the Reformation of the
              Church, I hope no true Son of the Church of</hi> England
              <hi>will oppose it.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            For this our <hi>Inquirer</hi> charges
              the
            
            Dean <hi>with setting
              a greater
              value on the Honour and Reputation of
              men
              than on Union, or the relieving
              tender Consciences,
              in order to Union.</hi> Had
              he been
              to deal with Mr. <hi>A.</hi> he would
              presently
              have sent
              him
              a Writ for a <hi>Melius Inquirendum,</hi>
            
            
            
            but to no purpose; for no man is
              capable of making
              <hi>Inquiries,</hi>
              who cannot
              understand plain and familiar Sense, nor carry the Connexion
              of three or four Sentences
              in his head together.
          </p>
          <p>But that every sober Christian may see how
            maliciously
            and impudently
            this <hi>modest Inquirer</hi> charges
            the <hi>Dean</hi> with <hi>setling
            a greater
            value on the Honour and Reputation of
            men,
            than on Union.</hi> I would desire my
            Readers
            to take notice,
            that these words,
            which he thus Burlesques,
            and which I have transcribed
            out of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Preface, are part of a long
            Discourse, beginning
            at page 81. in answer
            to that more <hi>peaceable Inquiry</hi> what may be
            done
            <hi>for the Satisfaction of mens
            Consciences,
            and for the Peace and Stability
            of this Church?</hi> where he makes
            as fair and equal Proposals
            for the Satisfaction
            of Dissenters,
            as any man can desire,
            who will be pleased
            with any thing less than a total Subversion of the present
            Constitution.</p>
          <p>
            As for the Laity, who allow the use of the Liturgy, but
              scruple some Rites
              and Ceremonies
              annexed
              to the Administration
              of the Sacraments,
              after having
              declared,
              that after the most diligent Search, he could find no ground
              for any
            
            
            scruple of Conscience about such
              matters,
              nor for the peoples
              separation from other Acts
              of Communion, on account of some
              Rites
              they suspect to be unlawful;
              yet for the Satisfaction of such
              men,
              he offers
              his Opinion, that it would be a part of Christian Wisdom and
              Condescension in Governours,
              if the sign of the Cross were
              wholly
              taken
              away, or confined
              to the publick
              Administration
              of Baptism, or left indifferent,
              as the Parents
              desire it: that kneeling
              at the Lord's Supper might be imposed
              on none that scruple it, provided,
              that such persons
              receive with least offence to others, and rather
              standing
              than sitting,
              because the former is
              most agreeable to the practice of Antiquity, and of our
              neighbour reformed
              Churches:
              that as to the Surplice in Parochial
              Churches,
              it is
              not of that Consequence as to bear a Dispute one way or
              other, with some little Alteration in the use of
              God-fathers,
              and God-mothers,
              to remove some
              Scruples,
              which have been
              started
              of late days
              about that matter. I have given
              a brief account of this, that every one may judge of the
              Modesty and Honesty of our <hi>Inquirer,</hi> who
              tells,
              us as the Sense of the <hi>Dean</hi> and the
              Episcopal
            
            
            
            party, that they have once imposed
              these things,
              and cannot now honourably
              recede from the least <hi>Iota:</hi> so that it
              seems,
              the Cross in Baptism, kneeling
              at Sacrament, and the use of the
              Surplice,
              which they have made
              such a horrible Stir and Pother about, and which are the
              only Ceremonies
              retained
              in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are now
              dwindled
              away into something less than the least <hi>Iota,</hi> which
              other people will call nothing; which
              shews
              what an
              admirable
              Controversie
              this has
              been,
              that they have divided
              the Church, and destroyed
              the Peace and Unity of Christians,
              for that which they themselves now think to be less than the
              least <hi>Iota.</hi> But this ever
              was,
              and ever will be the Temper of these
              men,
              mightily
              to undervalue every thing, which
              is
              granted
              them
              for Peace sake, till they can overturn the present
              Constitution of our Church, to say no worse: From whence the
              Parliament
              may learn, what Thanks
              they are like to have for any Comprehension or Indulgence,
              which does
              not overthrow the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            But to proceed, as for other people, who will not
              communicate with us upon these Terms,
              he proposes
              a limited
              Indulgence
            
            
            
            for them,
              and yet this also is
              less than <hi>the least Iota:</hi> for whatever they
              pretend, it is
              not Indulgence, but Rule and Empire they desire; not the
              ease of their own Consciences,
              but Power to impose upon others, which
              is
              then a very good thing, when they have the
              keeping
              and exercise of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From hence the <hi>Dean</hi> proceeds
              to consider the case of <hi>ejected
              Ministers,</hi>
            
            and proposes,
              <hi>That the bare Subscription of thirty six
              Articles
              concerning
              doctrinal Points,
              be not allowed
              as sufficient to qualifie
              any man for a Living,
              or any Church Preferment;</hi> because it
              is
              impossible to preserve the Constitution of our Church upon
              these Terms.
              And upon this occasion
              he adds
              those words,
              which I before
              transcribed,
              <hi>We do heartily
              and sincerely
              desire Union,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning
              of which is,
              that we are sincerely
              willing to make any Condescensions
              for Peace-sake, which will not overthrow the Church of
              <hi>England,</hi> nor insinuate a false and scandalous
              Accusation of the unlawfulness
              of our Constitution, and Rites
              of Worship, which we cannot do with a safe Conscience,
              because we believe
              the contrary, that our Worship is
              lawful, and that our Church ought to
            
            
            
            be upheld,
              as the most Apostolical and best
              Reformed
              Church in the World, and we are not so charitable as to give
              ease to other mens Consciences
              to injure our own, and thereby condemn the
              <hi>Reformation,</hi>
              which, whatever this <hi>Inquirer</hi>
              thinks,
              will give great advantage to Popery, of which more
              hereafter.
          </p>
          <p>And, is
            not our Author a skilful Interpreter,
            as well as a <hi>modest Inquirer,</hi> who from these
            words
            can prove, that the <hi>Dean</hi>
            prefers
            the Reputation of men
            before the Honour of Jesus Christ? but I do not much wonder at
            his mistake,
            considering,
            that Honour and Reputation is
            the great Support of their Schism, which
            made
            him
            so easily
            suspect it of
            others, and expound the most innocent
            words
            by the Principles
            of their own Faction.</p>
          <p>
            Thus much for the Modesty and Peaceableness of this
              <hi>Inquiry.</hi> Let us now consider what those
              <hi>Historical Mistakes</hi>
              are, which he has
              found in the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Preface,
              Has
              he mis-cited
              any Authors,
              or reported
              any thing for matter of Fact which
              is
              not so? I confess, I was
              much surprized
              when I saw
              this charge in the Title page, which I could not suspect so
              exact and faithful a Writer as the
            
            
            <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> to be guilty of; which
              made
              me the more scrupulously
              examine this Pamphlet, to find where those
              Mistakes
              were;
              but I have looked
              till I have wearied
              my self, and can find none, nor so much as any pretence that
              there are any, but onely
              in the Title Page; though I found
              Mistakes
              enough of this <hi>Inquirer,</hi>
              of which he shall hear more in due time.

            <p>
              WHoever judges
                of the temper and Spirit of our
                Dissenters,
                by their loud Out-cries,
                and passionate Expostulations
                for Union, must needs
              
              
              
              wonder to see these Breaches
                continued,
                and that they can neither agree among themselves, nor with
                the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for,
                were
                these men
                of such Peaceable and uniting
                Principles,
                one would think it were
                no impossible thing, nor very difficult, to reconcile our
                present Differences,
                and to unite into one Christian Body and Society. But the
                truth is,
                <hi>Union</hi> will not serve their
                ends,
                but talking
                of <hi>Union,</hi> and desiring
                it, when they mean nothing less,
                does
                more effectually
                promote their Designs.
                Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can at any time give you twenty good
                and substantial Reasons,
                and more if you want them,
                to prove the necessity and advantages
                of <hi>Union,</hi> and as soon as he
                has
                done,
                can lay down as many Dividing
                Principles,
                which shall make <hi>Union</hi>
                absolutely
                impossible, unless all men
                will be of his mind.

            <p>
              This course our <hi>Inquirer</hi>
                takes,
                declames
                largely
                and frequently
                of the necessity
                of <hi>Union,</hi> and the mischief of
                <hi>Division:</hi>
                especially
                at such a time as this, when it
                is
                our Interest to <hi>unite</hi> against a <hi>common
                Enemy,</hi> when we are all in such present danger of
                being
                destroy'd by the
              
              
              <hi>Papists,</hi>
                if we do not unite; For, this seeming
                zeal for <hi>Union</hi> is
                a very plausible
                thing, and begets
                a great Opinion in the People of
                them,
                and a great compassion
                for them,
                and reflects
                a great deal of <hi>odium;</hi>
                especially
                upon the Bishops
                and Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                as if they were
                the onely
                men
                who opposed
                this <hi>happy Union;</hi> and this, as far as we can
                guess, by the tendency
                of their Actions,
                and other Discourses,
                is
                the only Design of their <hi>great noise</hi> and
                <hi>clamor</hi> for <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this is
              so thin and transparent
              a Fallacy, that I wonder every Porter cannot see through it;
              for if their zealous <hi>Out-cries</hi>
              (I had
              almost said
              <hi>Out-rages)</hi>
              for <hi>Union,</hi> be an
              Argument of
              their great love to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> I
              would give something to see the man who
              is
              an
              Enemy to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union:</hi> for I never
              met
              with any man yet but would speak very
              kindly
              of it: I am
              sure there are no men
              in the World who have appeared
              more zealous for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> both in
              their Sermons
              and Writings,
              than the Episcopal Clergy
              of this Church; and therefore so far we are equal.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>
              The Reverend <hi>Dean</hi> was
                himself a great Example of this Zeal for Union, in that
                excellent Sermon, which has
                been
                made
                the occasion of these fierce and unchristian
                Disputes;
                and it is
                very pretty to
                observe, how this <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>peaceable
                Inquirer,</hi> who pretends
                so much Zeal for Union, endeavours
                to prove the <hi>Dean</hi> a Papist, for this very Reason;
                for he tells
                us, <hi>That he falls
                in</hi>
              
              <hi>with</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>entertaining
                the same Principles,
                and arguing
                from the same Topicks
                with him;</hi>
                and gives
                this very Instance
                of it, that <hi>as</hi> Bellarmine <hi>doth, in the
                general, highly
                extol Union, Peace, and Concord, in the Church,
                making
                it a note of the true Church</hi> (and I wish
                <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had
                never given
                a worse note of the true Church, than Union) <hi>even so
                the Dr. (tho he doth not make Peace and Concord a note of
                the Church</hi> (and therefore it
                seems,
                does
                not fall in with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though I
                believe the
                Dr. will not much differ with him
                on this point) <hi>yet he doth speak enough of it's
                Excellency and Desireableness;
                for Union is
                a lovely name, which is
                in great Esteem, even among such as will not part with a
                Toy or Trifle for the obtaining
                the thing.</hi> What a dangerous thing
                is
                this <hi>Union?</hi> That a man cannot speak of it's
              
              
              <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Desireableness,</hi>
                unless he be a Papist? What a mighty passionate Admirer of
                <hi>Union</hi> is
                this <hi>Inquirer?</hi> And yet,
                methinks,
                if <hi>Union be so lovely a name,</hi> (as he
                adds
                in the very next Words,
                without considering
                how well they agree with the former) a man may at least
                commend it moderately,
                without the
                suspicion of Popery; and he has
                not proved,
                that the <hi>Dean</hi> was
                immoderate
                in it's Commendations:
                he only says,
                that he has
                spoke
                <hi>enough,</hi> not that he has
                spoke
                too much of it's Excellency,
                and therefore I charitably
                hope, that he may be no Papist for all this. Though I
                fear, we cannot bring off Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so well,
                who, in his late book, entitled,
                <hi>The true and only way of Concord,</hi>
                has
                spent
                about seventy pages
                in describing
                the Nature, Excellency, Necessity and
                Advantages
                of Union; and in his <hi>Search for the</hi> English
                <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                comes
                so near <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as to
                assert
                <hi>Unity to be essential to the universal and particular
                Churches,</hi>
                p. 42. And that which is
                essential, is
                certainly
                a very good and infallible note of a Church: But it
                is
                to be hoped,
                that this is
                none of the most dangerous points
                of Popery, or how Popish soever some
                men
                may be
              
              
              
              in these Speculations,
                there is
                no apparent
                danger, that ever they will practice such a
                peice
                of Popery.

            <head>Sect. II. Who are the Dividers.</head>
            <p>BUT let us now examine, who is
              this Divider, and where the Schismatick
              is
              to be found; for if <hi>Union be so lovely a name,</hi> as
              our <hi>Inquirer</hi> tells
              us, those must be very ill men,
              who oppose Union, and make divisions
              in the Christian
              Church; and I hope I have so great a Sense of the evil of
              this, that I would not be found guilty of it, to gain
              an
              universal Empire: But this is
              no more than what all men
              say, and therefore impute the Schism to the opposite
              Party. But our
              <hi>Inquirer</hi> thinks
              he has
              demonstrated
              the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not the
              Dissenters,
              to be guilty of the Schism, by a very obvious and popular
              Argument, which I shall briefly
              consider. And
              it runs
              thus;</p>
            <p>
              <hi>If the Dissenters
                can, without Offence to</hi>
              
              <hi>God and wrong to their own Consciences,
                comply with the Terms
                imposed
                by you for</hi> Union, <hi>their
                Non-complyance
                is
                a Sin,
              
              
              that in it's Tendencies
                advanceth
                Popery; but if the Dissenter cannot conform to your
                Impositions,
                as they really
                cannot, and you can, without Sin, make such
                easie
                Overtures
                for Peace, as may be grateful to
                Dissenters,
                your refusing
                in this case to comply, doth sufficiently
                convince you to be the Divider and Promoter of the
                Papacy.</hi> As for promoting
                the Papacy, of that more hereafter;
                at present I shall consider the
                Argument,
                as it relates
                to the Divider, and shall first examine the
                Terms
                of it. He makes
                doing
                a thing <hi>without Offence to God,</hi> and <hi>without
                wronging
                their own Consciences,</hi>
                to signifie
                the same thing, which yet are of a very different
                Nature, and
                very often separated.
                A man may offend God in doing
                that wherein he does
                not wrong his own Conscience, as all those do, who break
                any divine Law in Complyance
                with the Judgment
                of their own Conscience, as too many, I fear, do; unless
                we will say, that no man ever followed
                an
                erroneous and mistaken
                Conscience, or that he did
                not displease God in doing
                so. And a man may wrong his own Conscience in
                doing
                what is,
                in it self lawful, but judged
                unlawful by him,
                and so far sin in doing
                it, when he does
                not offend God
              
              
              
              with respect to what he does;
                as is
                plain in the case of those who do a
                lawful thing
                against their Conscience. Now our <hi>Inquirer</hi>
                is
                certainly
                in the Right so far, that whoever cannot comply
                without both
                <hi>offending
                God,</hi> with respect to the Nature of the Action, and
                <hi>wronging
                his own Conscience,</hi> can be no
                Schismatick;
                but then his bare saying
                that <hi>they really
                cannot,</hi> is
                no sufficient Proof of this: if he
                were
                sufficiently
                assured,
                what the Judgment
                of all the Dissenters
                is
                in this point, (which certainly,
                no one man can be secure of) he might then conclude, (if
                he knew
                them
                all to believe
                Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                to be a Sin) that they could not comply without
                wronging
                their own Consciences:
                but there is
                something more required,
                to prove such a Complyance
                to be an
                offence against God, any otherwise than as it
                is
                against their Consciences;
                but he does
                not meddle with this, and I suppose will think
                better of it,
                before he undertakes
                it. But this is
                a pretty Insinuation, that every thing that
                is
                against their Consciences,
                is
                a Sin against God; that is,
                that their Conscience is
                a Rule to God, not the Law of God a Rule to their
                Consciences;
              
              
              the last of which, I confess, is
                too true, but I must deny the first, unless we will make
                the Will and Law of God, as uncertain and various, and
                contrary to it self, as the Consciences
                of men
                are. And the latter part of his Argument
                is
                as faulty and precarious as the first; for, he
                tells
                the <hi>Dean, And you can, without Sin, make
                easie
                Overtures
                for Peace, as may be grateful to
                Dissenters;
                your refusing,
                in this case, to comply, doth sufficiently
                convince you
                to be the Divider.</hi> Now, how this <hi>Inquirer</hi>
                understands
                this, or ever should, unless he
                intends
                to set up a <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition for mens
                Consciences
                and secret Opinions,
                I cannot imagine; I am
                confident, the <hi>Dean</hi> never
                told
                them
                any such thing, and I am
                apt to guess, that if those Overtures,
                which he has
                already made
                to <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
                be not <hi>grateful,</hi> he can make none, without Sin,
                that will; that is,
                without wronging
                his own Conscience, and offending
                God, in pulling
                down the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and indeed, it
                is
                impossible to make such Overtures,
                as shall please all Dissenters,
                if you will reckon the <hi>Independents,</hi>
                and the <hi>good Protestant Dissenters</hi>
                the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
                without it.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>But, suppose the <hi>Dean,</hi> or any other of the
              Episcopal Clergy, could make such
              Proposals,
              and did
              not, how does
              this prove them
              to be the <hi>Dividers?</hi>
              If the present terms
              of Communion are lawful and innocent, those are the
              <hi>Dividers</hi>
              who <hi>separate,</hi> not those who make no <hi>new
              Overtures,</hi>
              when there is
              no need of it? And how can he prove that private
              men
              are bound
              to make Proposals
              which they have not Authority to Enact into
              Laws,
              when it can only shew
              their good will, and, it may be, expose
              them
              to the Censure of their Superiors,
              for their sakes
              who will not thank them
              for it, but has
              no more effect than to write another <hi>Eutopian
              Commonwealth.</hi></p>
            <p>
              But the Substance of this Argument we find in another
                Dress afterwards;
              
              <hi>The Church, without sin, can part with their
                indifferent Ceremonies,
                but</hi> Dissenters,
                <hi>without sin, cannot comply with
                them;
                what then must be done
                for</hi> Union? <hi>Must the</hi> Episcopal <hi>comply in
                things
                wherein they can, without Sin? or must the</hi>
                Dissenters
                <hi>sin, and loose their Peace with God for</hi> Union?
                And, a little after, he adds,
                <hi>This is
                the state of the case, the</hi>
                Dissenters
                <hi>would</hi> unite <hi>but cannot, the</hi>
                Episcopals
                <hi>can, but will not; the</hi> cannot <hi>of</hi>
                Dissenters,
              
              
              <hi>and the</hi> Episcopals
                will not, <hi>doth make the</hi> Division; <hi>but who
                is
                the</hi> faulty Divider? <hi>If the true reason of our
                Division lay
                on the Dissenters</hi>
                will not, <hi>when they</hi> can, <hi>'twould be
                easie
                to conclude them
                obstinate and perverse, what, not to do what they</hi> can
                <hi>for</hi> Peace? <hi>but since they</hi> would,
                <hi>but</hi> cannot, <hi>without</hi> Sin, <hi>how can
                they be the</hi> Dividers?
            </p>
            <p>
              Now this is
                all Trick and Fallacy, when he sayes,
                <hi>the Church, without sin, can part with their
                indifferent Ceremonies:</hi>
                If by <hi>the Church</hi> he means
                any thing less than the King and Parliament, it
                is
                false; for all the Bishops
                and Clergy in <hi>England</hi> cannot, without
                <hi>Sin,</hi> part with these <hi>indifferent
                Ceremonies,</hi>
                till the Law enacting
                them
                be repealed:
                unless he thinks
                it no Sin to disobey Authority in
                <hi>indifferent
                things;</hi>
                which, if he does,
                I can assure him,
                the Church of <hi>England</hi> does
                not; and, if by <hi>indifferent
                Ceremonies</hi>
                he means
                <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
                as he must, to please <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
                since nothing
                less will please them,
                the Church of <hi>England</hi> does
                not account these <hi>indifferent
                Ceremonies,</hi>
                nor think she <hi>can part with
                them
                without sin:</hi> and when he says,
                <hi>that the Dissenters,
                without sin, cannot comply with
                them;</hi>
                if, by <hi>without sin,</hi> he
              
              
              
              means
                without breaking
                some Divine Law, it is
                false; for there is
                no Law to forbid our Obedience to Civil and
                Ecclesiastical
                Governours,
                in <hi>indifferent things:</hi>
                if he means,
                that they must act contrary to their Conscience, that
                is,
                their own Opinion and Judgment
                of things,
                they may be the <hi>Dividers</hi>
                and <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
                for all that, unless we will say, that no man, but a
                profligate Knave, who sins
                against his Conscience, can be a
                Schismatick.
            </p>
            <p>The like Answer may serve for his <hi>will not,</hi> and
              <hi>cannot;</hi> if by the Episcopals
              <hi>will not,</hi> he means,
              that they will not do, what they may by Divine and Humane
              Laws,
              and with a just respect to the good Order and Government,
              and Edification of the Church, and the Regular
              Administration of Holy Offices,
              they are faulty in it, but may be no
              Schismaticks
              notwithstanding, so long as they exact no sinful
              terms
              of Communion:
              and, if by the Dissenters
              <hi>cannot,</hi>
              he means
              their private Opinions,
              and Persuasions,
              which hinder their Compliance, they may be the
              <hi>Dividers</hi>
              still, if their Perswasions
              be erroneous.</p>
            <p>
              And, to convince him
                how fallacious this way of reasoning
                is,
                I will form an
              
              
              Argument exactly
                like his, which, I believe,
                he will not be well pleased
                with. <hi>If the Dissenters
                can without Sin, obey their Governours
                in</hi> indifferent, <hi>that is,
                in</hi> lawful <hi>things,
                but will not; and the</hi> Episcopal <hi>would be content
                to part with</hi> indifferent <hi>things
                for</hi> Union, <hi>but cannot, who
                is
                the</hi> faulty Divider? <hi>what must be
                done
                for</hi> Union? <hi>Must the Dissenters
                comply in things
                wherein they can without Sin, or must the Episcopal sin,
                and lose their Peace with God for</hi> Union? I would
                desire our <hi>Inquirer</hi> to think better of it, and
                answer this Argument, if he can,
                without
                shewing
                the Sophistry of his own.
            </p>
            <p>
              But my Design is
                not so much to answer
                so <hi>inconsiderable a Pamphlet,</hi> as to take occasion
                to remove some Popular
                and prevailing
                Mistakes;
                and therefore
                I shall more particularly
                examine this Matter: for, if there be any force in this
                Argument, it consists
                in these two things.
                First, That all things,
                which are, in their own nature, <hi>indifferent,</hi> may,
                without Sin, be parted
                with: And secondly,
                That the Opinion of Dissenters,
                that <hi>indifferent things</hi>
                are unlawful in the Worship of God,
                is
                a just Reason
                for parting
                with them:
                For, if it be not lawful to part with every thing that
              
              
              
              is
                <hi>indifferent,</hi> those who retain the use of some
                <hi>indifferent things,</hi>
                cannot meerly,
                upon that account, be called
                <hi>Dividers,</hi>
                or <hi>Schismaticks;</hi>
                and if the Opinion
                of Dissenters,
                that all <hi>indifferent things</hi>
                are <hi>unlawful,</hi> be not a sufficient Reason for
                parting
                with them,
                then there may be no fault in the
                Episcopals
                <hi>will not,</hi> nor a sufficient justification or
                excuse in the Dissenters
                <hi>cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, as for the First, That all
                things,
                in their own nature, <hi>indifferent,</hi> that
                is,
                such things
                as are neither commanded
                nor forbid by God, as any parts
                of Religious
                Worship, may not, <hi>without Sin,</hi> be
                parted
                with, appears
                from hence, because there can be no
                Publick
                and Solemn Worship, no Face or Appearance
                of any Discipline or Government in the Church, without the
                Use of some such <hi>indifferent
                things;</hi>
                All Actions
                must be cloathed
                with some such <hi>external Circumstances,</hi>
                as though they are not essential
                to the <hi>moral nature</hi> of the Action, yet are
                necessary to the <hi>external performance</hi>
                of it, A man who is
                to remove from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi>
                is
                not bound
                either to go
                thither on foot, or to ride on Horse-back, or in a Coach,
                or in a Waggon;
                each of these wayes
                are in themselves
              
              
              <hi>indifferent;</hi> but yet if he will
                travel to
                <hi>York,</hi> he must use one or other of these
                <hi>ways
                of Motion;</hi> not any one in particular
                is
                necessary, but yet some or other
                is:
                A man who is
                disposed
                to be <hi>charitable,</hi> is
                not con_in'd
                to any one sort of <hi>Charity,</hi> but may either
                <hi>redeem</hi> Captives, and <hi>release</hi> poor
                Prisoners,
                by paying
                their Debts,
                or <hi>make provision</hi> for Widows
                and Orphans,
                or <hi>build</hi> Schools
                or Hospitals,
                according
                as his Inclination
                or Ability serves;
                but if he will be <hi>charitable,</hi> he must do some
                good <hi>charitable
                Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we will suppose, that every man, in his <hi>private
              devotions,</hi>
              is
              at liberty to chuse
              for himself the Time, and Place, and Habit, and Posture of
              <hi>Prayer,</hi> and whether he will use <hi>mental</hi> or
              <hi>vocal Prayers,</hi>
              whether a <hi>set Form</hi> of words,
              or <hi>extemporary</hi> and <hi>conceived
              Prayer;</hi> whether he will pray out of a Book, or from his
              Memory; but yet some <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and
              <hi>posture,</hi> and <hi>habit</hi>
              is
              necessary,
              not to the <hi>nature</hi> of the Duty, but to the
              <hi>performance</hi> of it, and he must pray either with or
              without a <hi>Form, &amp;c.</hi></p>
            <p>
              We cannot say that any one <hi>indifferent
                thing is
                necessary</hi> and <hi>unalterable,</hi> for
              
              
              
              then it would be no longer
                <hi>indifferent,</hi> but we must say, that the use of
                some <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>uncommanded
                things</hi>
                is
                <hi>necessary,</hi> especially
                in Publick
                and Solemn
                Acts
                of <hi>Worship,</hi> and in the
                <hi>external</hi>
                Administration of Church-Discipline
                and Government, unless they can
                shew
                us, where Christ has,
                by an
                express Law
                determined
                all the <hi>external Circumstances,</hi>
                and <hi>Rites,</hi>
                and <hi>Modes</hi>
                of <hi>Worship,</hi> and given
                us an

                Body of <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi>
                for Discipline and Government, or think it possible to
                perform all the Duties
                of <hi>publick
                Worship,</hi>
                without any <hi>external circumstances</hi>
                of Worship.
            </p>
            <p>Were
              our <hi>Dissenters</hi>
              but so honest, as impartially
              to consider the several <hi>Models</hi>
              and <hi>Platforms</hi>
              of their own Churches,
              and the Publick
              Worship in Use among them,
              they would quickly
              discover how
              many things
              are daily Practised
              by them,
              without the least pretence
              to a <hi>Divine Command,</hi> and which they themselves
              alter, as often as they see or fancy a Reason for it.</p>
            <p>
              Where have they an
                express Command
                to build publick
                Places
                for Religious
                Assemblies,
                to be appropriated
                to such Uses?
                much less is
                there any Divine
              
              
              Command to meet, and pray, and preach in
                <hi>Coffee-houses,
                Play-houses,
                Bear-Gardens,</hi>
                as we know some of them
                have done,
                and do at this day? If the manner
                and circumstances
                of <hi>Religious worship</hi>
                be so exactly
                described
                by our Saviour
                and his Apostles,
                how comes
                it to pass that they differ so much among themselves in
                these matters?
                that some begin their <hi>Exercises</hi>
                of <hi>Religion</hi> with Prayer, and
                reading
                some part of the Scripture, and then sing a <hi>Psalm</hi>
                in <hi>English</hi>
                Rhyme, (which is
                so late an
                Invention,
                that certainly
                it could not be an
                <hi>Apostolical Constitution)</hi> and then pray again in
                the Pulpit, and preach upon some Text of Scripture, and
                then pray over their Sermon again: but others can find no
                time for reading
                the Scripture
                at all, but begin with a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and then
                shew
                their own <hi>Gifts</hi>
                in praying
                and preaching?
                Where do they find a Divine Command for
                reading
                the Scriptures
                in the <hi>Desk,</hi> and preaching
                in the <hi>Pulpit?</hi> What Command can they
                shew
                for praying
                <hi>without a Form,</hi> any more than for
                praying
                <hi>with one?</hi> for preaching
                and praying
                by the <hi>Hour-glass,</hi> and
                especially
                on <hi>Fast-dayes,</hi>
                for praying
                a <hi>full hour</hi> at least? What Command have
              
              
              
              they for observing
                the 5th of <hi>November</hi> for a <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi>
                any more than for observing
                the 30th of <hi>January</hi> for a <hi>Fast?</hi> and why
                then do they observe the <hi>one</hi> and not the
                <hi>other?</hi> What Command
                do they find in Scripture for making
                <hi>Pews</hi>
                in Churches,
                and <hi>seating</hi>
                Persons
                according
                to their <hi>Quality,</hi> which
                seems
                so contrary to an
                <hi>Apostolical Precept?</hi>
              
              What Command have they for <hi>sitting</hi>
                or <hi>lolling</hi>
                in their Seats
                all the time of Prayers,
                or for the Ministers
                preaching
                with their <hi>Hats
                off,</hi> and the Peoples
                hearing
                with their <hi>Hats
                on?</hi> What Command have they for
                receiving
                the <hi>Communion</hi> at <hi>Noon,</hi> and
                turning
                the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> into a <hi>Dinner?</hi> for
                receiving
                in the <hi>Church,</hi> and not in
                an
                <hi>upper Room</hi> of a <hi>private house?</hi>
                sitting,
                and not in a posture of <hi>leaning,</hi>
                as our Saviour received?
                (for <hi>Religious Institutions</hi>
                must not vary with the Custom of the
                Countries.)
                What Command have they for giving
                the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to <hi>Women,</hi>
                when Christ onely
                gave
                it to <hi>men,</hi>
                though he had
                a great many <hi>Women
                Disciples</hi>
                also at that time?
            </p>
            <p>
              It were
                easie
                to ask a great many more such Questions,
                but these are enough to convince any honest and
                impartial
              
              
              man, that he does,
                and, of necessity,
                must use, a great many external
                Circumstances
                of Worship, which are no where commanded
                by God, and therefore are, in their own nature,
                <hi>indifferent,</hi>
                and yet that some such <hi>indifferent
                things</hi>
                are absolutely
                necessary in external Worship: for when
                men
                pray, it must be in a form of Words
                or without
                it, either kneeling,
                sitting,
                standing,
                or prostrate, or some such like
                posture,
                either covered
                or uncovered,
                and so it is
                in other Acts
                of Worship; and therefore, though we should
                suppose all
                Times,
                Places,
                Postures,
                Habits,
                <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be equally
                <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet some or other, are necessary,
                because no external Action can he
                performed
                without
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, if publick
                Worship cannot be performed
                without some <hi>indifferent Usages,</hi>
                then all <hi>indifferent things</hi>
                cannot lawfully
                be parted
                with, and therefore the Bare not
                parting
                with <hi>indifferent things,</hi>
                cannot make any man or Church a guilty <hi>Divider;</hi>
                for though a Church may part with such, or such
                <hi>indifferent</hi> Ceremonies,
                it cannot part with all, continuing
                a Church; and therefore, certainly
                may retain some, and therefore
              
              
              
              those that she has,
                if they be decent
                and comply with the end and nature
                of Worship, as well as any other. For if the Argument lie
                against <hi>indifferent
                Ceremonies</hi>
                considered
                as <hi>indifferent,</hi> (as it must do here, if it have
                any sense in it) no Church can possibly,
                according
                to these Principles,
                avoid the Guilt of Schism, unless she alter her
                Constitutions,
                as often as every capricious Humorist
                shall alter his Opinions;
                and this is
                as evidently
                true, as the Experience
                of forty years
                can make it. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
                disliked
                the <hi>indifferent Ceremonies</hi>
                of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore pull'd it
                down; but were
                they ever the nearer
                Union for this? by no means.
                The Independents
                as much disliked
                the Presbyterian Model, and therefore set up a
                purer
                Church of their own, and the Quakers
                and other Sectaries,
                neither liked
                them,
                nor one another; so that unless we can so model a Church
                as to please every man's Fancy, who
                is
                seldom pleased
                long with his own; we had
                as good stay where we are. Indeed this Argument
                lies
                equally
                against all Churches
                in the World, who retain the use of any <hi>indifferent
                C_stoms
                or Ceremonies,</hi>
                which other persons
              
              
              cannot, in Conscience, comply with: and thus the
                Presbyterians,
                Independents,
                and all Sectaries,
                are Schismaticks
                to one another; the only Difference
                is,
                that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                calls
                <hi>indifferent
                things,
                indifferent;</hi> but our <hi>Dissenters</hi>
                call their <hi>indifferent Usages,</hi>
                necessary,
                and pretend Divine Commands
                and Institutions,
                which they could never
                yet produce. And thus I must confess,
                the Church is
                the <hi>Divider,</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
                though they separate without Cause, are very guiltless and
                innocent, if a true understanding
                of the Nature of Christian Liberty can make a
                Schismatick,
                and a superstitious and ignorant mistake of
                <hi>indifferent things</hi>
                for <hi>necessary,</hi>
                can justifie
                a Separation.
            </p>
            <p>I can foresee but two Objections,
              which can be made
              against this Discourse;
              the first is,
              that I confound <hi>indifferent</hi>
              Circumstances
              of Action, with <hi>indifferent</hi>
              Ceremonies
              of Religion. Secondly,
              that though some <hi>indifferent</hi>
              Circumstances
              must be acknowledged
              necessary in the external exercise of
              Religion, yet
              no such particular Circumstances
              ought to be imposed,
              but to remain
              <hi>indifferent</hi> in their use, as well as in their
              Nature.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>As for the first, that I confound
              <hi>indifferent</hi>
              Circumstances
              of Action with <hi>indifferent</hi>
              Ceremonies;
              the Answer is
              very plain and easie,
              that there is
              but one Ceremony enjoyned
              by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which cannot be reckon'd
              among the necessary Circumstances
              of Action, and that is
              the Cross in Baptism, which is
              of such ancient use in the Christian
              Church, upon a great many other
              Accounts
              besides
              Baptism, that he must condemn all the
              Churches
              of the Christian
              World, which we have any Records
              of, in Ecclesiastical Writers,
              who accuses
              it of Superstition or Popery; not to take notice now, that
              the ancient
              Church used
              a great many other Ceremonies
              in Baptism, much more liable
              and obnoxious to Fanatick
              Censures,
              which are now disused
              among us: and since it is
              evident, how little these men
              will be pleased
              merely
              with taking
              away the use of the Cross (this <hi>Inquirer</hi>
              falling
              so rudely
              upon the <hi>Dean,</hi> after the
              proposal of
              taking
              it away, or leaving
              it <hi>indifferent)</hi> we may still keep
              an
              ancient and useful Rite, when parting
              with it will contribute nothing to <hi>Peace</hi> and
              <hi>Union.</hi></p>
            
            
            <p>But, the Surplice and kneeling
              at the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which are the two
              other
              Ceremonies
              retained
              by our Church, and if they please, they may reckon
              kneeling
              at Prayers,
              and standing
              up at the Hymns,
              the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the Creed, and the
              Gospels,
              are nothing more than the Circumstances
              of Action, for they are reduced
              either to Postures
              or Habits,
              which are two necessary Circumstances
              of religious Actions,
              unless it be decent to worship God naked, or
              possible to
              worship him
              in no Posture at all.</p>
            <p>And, if they be grieved
              still, that these particular Habits
              and Postures
              are preferred
              before others, because of their <hi>Significancy,</hi> and
              so are turned
              into <hi>symbolical</hi>
              Ceremonies,
              I would desire them
              to consider, that there is
              no other Rule whereby to determine the <hi>proper
              Circumstances</hi>
              of <hi>Worship,</hi> but by their
              <hi>Significancy;</hi>
              which has
              often made
              me wonder, That men,
              in their Wits,
              should quarrel at any external <hi>Circumstances</hi>
              of Worship, upon account of their
              <hi>Significancy:</hi>
              if they signifie
              nothing but what is
              good, what is
              worthy of God, and his Worship, and
              becomes
              his Worshippers.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>How shall we know, whether we should pray and praise God,
              and feast at his Table, sitting,
              standing,
              or kneeling,
              with our Hats
              on, or off, but by considering,
              which is
              most decent and suitable to the Nature of the Action? That
              is,
              by considering
              what the <hi>Meaning</hi>
              and <hi>Signification</hi> of such
              Postures
              are, and which of them
              signifie
              most agreeably
              to the nature of such religious
              Actions.</p>
            <p>Why it is
              thought so undecent to appear
              in Sack-cloath
              and Ashes
              on days
              of publick
              Joy, when our work is
              to praise God for his Goodness and Mercy or to adorn our
              selves
              on days
              of Fasting
              and Humiliation? To look Melancholy
              when we praise God, and to put on very
              chearful
              and pleasant Looks,
              when we confess our Sins,
              and deprecate
              his Judgments?
              Why does
              St. <hi>Paul</hi> take so much Pains
              to shew
              the Undecency
              of a man's praying
              covered,
              or a Woman unconvered, from the different Signification of
              them?
              1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> II 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi></p>
            <p>
              The truth is,
                it is
                not so <hi>indifferent</hi> as some imagine; what the
                <hi>external circumstances</hi>
                of <hi>Worship</hi> are: for the
                <hi>significancy,</hi>
                or, as others would call it, the
              
              
              <hi>symbolicalness</hi> of such
                <hi>Circumstances,</hi>
                must determine their <hi>sutableness</hi>
                or <hi>unsutableness</hi>
                to <hi>religious actions;</hi>
                for no Time, nor Place, Habit, or Gesture, or
                Words
                can be <hi>pleasing</hi>
                to God, which do not signifie
                something <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of
                <hi>Religion,</hi>
                and whether the Signification be <hi>natural</hi> or
                <hi>instituted,</hi>
                it is
                much at one, so it signifie
                <hi>certainly</hi>
                and <hi>constantly;</hi>
                to be sure the <hi>meer
                significancy</hi> of such <hi>circumstances,</hi>
                cannot be a <hi>fault,</hi> when there
                is
                nothing of any value in them
                but their <hi>significancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we must consider, that the <hi>true worship</hi> of
              God consists
              in the <hi>inward devotion</hi>
              of our <hi>Minds,</hi>
              which none can know but God and our
              selves;
              but <hi>external
              worship</hi> is
              nothing else but a <hi>visible</hi> representation of
              <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>invisible devotion,</hi> which must
              be seen
              in our <hi>external behaviour;</hi> and therefore,
              unless our
              <hi>words</hi>
              and <hi>actions,
              postures</hi>
              and <hi>habits</hi>
              do one way or other signifie
              our <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> for God, they
              cannot be so much as the <hi>external
              circumstances</hi>
              of <hi>Religion,</hi> because there
              is
              nothing of <hi>Religion</hi> in
              them.</p>
            <p>
              Indeed it is
                impossible for men,
                let them
                do what they can, to strip their
                <hi>actions</hi>
                of all <hi>signification,</hi> which should
              
              
              
              make them
                more <hi>modest</hi> in blaming
                any thing that <hi>signifies
                well,</hi> and more <hi>careful</hi>
                of doing
                any thing that <hi>signifies
                ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              When men
                <hi>sit</hi> at Publick
                Prayers,
                and, it may be, with their <hi>Hats</hi>
                half on, this will signifie,
                either that they do not believe that God
                <hi>sees</hi>
                them,
                and that the holy Angels
                <hi>attend</hi> our <hi>Assemblies,</hi>
                or that God does
                not matter <hi>external
                honour,</hi> that is,
                <hi>publick</hi>
                and <hi>visible worship;</hi> or that they do not owe so
                much <hi>reverence</hi> to <hi>him,</hi>
                as to their <hi>Prince.</hi> When they <hi>put on their
                Hats</hi>
                to hear a Sermon, it signifies,
                that either they do not believe
                <hi>preaching</hi>
                to be a part of <hi>God's worship,</hi> (and yet those who
                are most guilty of this, hardly
                think any else to be a <hi>necessary part</hi> of
                <hi>publick
                worship)</hi>
                or that they are not in God's <hi>immediate
                presence,</hi> while the <hi>Sermon</hi>
                is
                <hi>preaching,</hi>
                or that they hear Sermons,
                not as <hi>Disciples</hi>
                and <hi>Scholars,</hi>
                but as <hi>Masters</hi>
                and <hi>Judges.</hi>
                When they <hi>sit</hi> at the <hi>Lord</hi>'s
                <hi>Table,</hi> it is
                a true <hi>symbolical ceremony,</hi>
                which represents
                a very great <hi>familiarity</hi>
                with Christ, but signifies
                very little <hi>distance</hi> or <hi>worship.</hi> When
                they <hi>pray</hi> an
                hour or two together, any thing that
                comes
                next, to those who cannot believe that they are all this
                while <hi>inspired,</hi>
              
              
              at least, not when they pray <hi>Nonsence,</hi>
                or <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion,</hi> this
                signifies,
                that they neither consider that <hi>God</hi>
                is
                in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi>
                for then, according
                to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s direction, their
                <hi>words</hi>
                would be <hi>wise and few; much,</hi> and
                <hi>extemporary</hi> talking,
                used
                to signifie
                either <hi>great boldness</hi> and
                <hi>confidence,</hi>
                or <hi>great intimacy</hi> and <hi>friendship,</hi> but it
                never signified
                <hi>worship</hi> before. When they celebrate <hi>religious
                Assemblies</hi>
                in <hi>Bear-gardens</hi>
                and <hi>Play-houses,</hi>
                it signifies
                indeed, that they believe God is
                <hi>every where,</hi> but if a <hi>Place</hi> can
                signifie
                any thing, it signifies
                no great <hi>reverence</hi> for <hi>Divine worship,</hi>
                or that they do not think their
                <hi>prayers</hi>
                or <hi>preaching</hi>
                to be the <hi>worship of God.</hi> And, I suppose, those
                <hi>gentile
                Sons
                of the Church of England</hi> meant
                some such Sermons
                as these, of whom
                Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reports,
                that they have been
                often heard
                to say, <hi>That they can profit</hi>
              
              <hi>more by a Play than by a Sermon;</hi> and when they
                fast the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> and
                refuse to fast
                the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> do what they can, it will
                signifie
                a Spirit of <hi>Rebellion;</hi>
                and let them
                stretch their Lungs
                never so much in declaming
                against <hi>Popery,</hi>
                to fast on the 5th of <hi>November</hi>
                is
                a <hi>symbolical ceremony.</hi>
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>As for the second Objection, That, though some
              <hi>external circumstances</hi>
              are <hi>necessary to publick
              worship,</hi> yet there is
              no <hi>necessity</hi> that they should be
              <hi>determined,</hi>
              but they may be left to <hi>every man,</hi> or
              <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi>
              what they <hi>please;</hi> I shall return two or three short
              Answers
              to it.</p>
            <p>First, Unless they can prove, not
              only that they
              <hi>may,</hi> but that they <hi>must</hi> not be
              determined,
              no Church can be accused
              of <hi>Schism</hi> for determining
              such <hi>external
              modes</hi>
              and <hi>circumstances</hi>
              of <hi>worship,</hi> as are of <hi>good use</hi> and
              signification in <hi>Religion,</hi> or for
              obliging
              all in her <hi>Communion</hi>
              to observe them;
              for, if there be no necessity of
              leaving
              these matters
              at <hi>liberty,</hi> every Church may
              <hi>chuse</hi>
              for her self, and if she <hi>chuse
              well,</hi> those are the <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
              who reject her Communion.</p>
            <p>
              But secondly,
                This not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must</hi> be so, if we
                will allow that Church-Governours
                and Christian Magistrates
                are bound
                to take care of <hi>publick
                worship;</hi>
                for <hi>publick
                worship,</hi> (as you have already
                heard)
                consists
                in the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>visible
                expressions</hi>
                of <hi>Devotion,</hi> in <hi>times,
                places,
                postures,
                habits,
                words,</hi>
                or <hi>actions;</hi>
                and if these be not <hi>determined,</hi>
              
              
              there is
                no security that God shall be <hi>worshipped,</hi>
                that is,
                shall be <hi>honoured;</hi>
                for, if men
                pretend to <hi>worship</hi> God in <hi>undecent
                words,
                places,
                postures,</hi>
                &amp;c. which are so far from signifying
                any <hi>Honour,</hi> that they signifie
                <hi>Contempt,</hi> how <hi>devout</hi> soever their
                <hi>minds</hi>
                may be, this is
                not <hi>external</hi> and <hi>publick
                worship,</hi> but a <hi>publick
                affront</hi> to the <hi>Deity;</hi> and
                therefore,
                at least, some <hi>indifferent things,</hi>
                some <hi>external circumstances</hi>
                of <hi>worship</hi> must be determined,
                if our Civil and Ecclesiastical
                Governours
                are bound
                to take care that God shall be <hi>publickly
                worshipped,</hi>
                and that no <hi>publick
                scorn</hi> be put upon <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly,
                To leave all the <hi>Externals</hi>
                of <hi>Religion</hi> at <hi>liberty,</hi>
                is
                so far from being
                the <hi>Cure</hi> of our <hi>Divisions,</hi>
                that it is
                the <hi>true Cause of them;</hi>
                and therefore, he is
                the <hi>true Schismatick,</hi>
                not who secures
                <hi>Christian Unity</hi> by a <hi>setled</hi>
                Constitution, but who leaves
                every man at <hi>liberty</hi> to do as he list. For, I
                suppose, when every man is
                left to do as he will, he will do, <hi>as he will;</hi>
                and thus one man will like <hi>one way</hi> of
                <hi>worship,</hi> and another <hi>another,</hi> and those
                who happen to be of the <hi>same mind,</hi> will
                <hi>unite</hi> into one <hi>Church,</hi> and thus shall we
                have <hi>distinct Churches</hi>
              
              
              
              and <hi>distinct Communions</hi>
                without end. This was
                the Effect of <hi>pulling
                down</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> heretofore, and
                this is
                that we <hi>complain</hi> of still; and our wise Author
                tells
                us, that the <hi>Church</hi> is
                the <hi>faulty Divider,</hi> because she
                has
                confined
                her <hi>Communion</hi> within certain
                <hi>Laws</hi>
                and <hi>Rules,</hi>
                which others will not <hi>conform</hi> to, and yet to have
                no certain <hi>Laws</hi>
                and <hi>Rules,</hi>
                is
                the most certain way to have no <hi>Union; Union</hi> may
                be preserved
                where there are <hi>fixed</hi>
                and <hi>setled
                terms</hi>
                of <hi>Communion,</hi> but it can never be
                preserved
                <hi>without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have considered
              the first thing supposed
              in our <hi>Inquirer</hi>'s <hi>Sophistical
              Argument,</hi>
              That all things,
              which are in their own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> may be
              <hi>parted
              with, without sin;</hi> and proceed to the second, <hi>That
              the Opinion of Dissenters,
              that</hi> indifferent things
              <hi>are unlawful in the</hi> Worship <hi>of God,
              is
              a</hi> just <hi>and</hi> necessary
              reason <hi>for parting
              with them.</hi>
              The plain sense of which is,
              That no <hi>Church</hi> can, without <hi>Schism,</hi> retain
              the most <hi>innocent</hi>
              and <hi>useful Ceremonies</hi>
              in Religion, if <hi>any</hi> man,
              especially
              if <hi>any number</hi> of men,
              think them
              to be neither <hi>innocent</hi> nor <hi>useful,</hi> though
              the <hi>Church</hi> still judges
              them
              to be so.</p>
            
            
            <p>Now, could they once gain this <hi>point,</hi>
              farewel
              to all <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> in the
              <hi>Christian Church;</hi> for it
              is
              demonstrable, how impossible it
              is
              to strip Religion so <hi>naked,</hi> but there will remain
              some <hi>indifferent
              Rites</hi>
              and <hi>Usages,</hi>
              which some men
              or other will <hi>condemn</hi> or <hi>scruple:</hi> We know
              what work there has
              been
              among the <hi>Quakers</hi>
              themselves, about <hi>praying</hi>
              with their Hats
              <hi>on,</hi> or <hi>off;</hi> and if this will admit a
              <hi>Dispute,</hi> what <hi>Religious
              Ceremonies</hi>
              can be <hi>secure?</hi> And yet, if this <hi>Principle</hi>
              were
              <hi>true,</hi> all other Churches
              must stoop to the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>slovenly
              Dispensation</hi> of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> and quit all the
              <hi>modes</hi>
              of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> which they cannot prove to be
              expresly
              commanded
              in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
              Nay, if what I have already discoursed,
                be <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>Publick
                Worship</hi> consists
                in such <hi>external signs</hi>
                of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi>
                as are not <hi>peremptorily
                determined</hi>
                by a <hi>Divine Law,</hi> we must have no
                <hi>Publick
                Worship,</hi> unless all men
                can agree in the same <hi>Rites</hi>
                and <hi>modes</hi>
                of <hi>worship;</hi> for, if any sort of
                men
                set up a <hi>peculiar way</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> for
                themselves, which other men
                do not like, and cannot <hi>joyn</hi>
                in, according
                to this <hi>Principle</hi> they are
                <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                and <hi>guilty Dividers:</hi>
                and
              
              
              
              yet if no <hi>Church</hi> must set up
                <hi>Publick
                Worship,</hi> till <hi>all</hi>
                men
                are agreed
                about the <hi>External Rites</hi>
                of <hi>worship,</hi> I greatly
                suspect it will take up some convenient
                time, in such an
                Age as this to do it; Especially
                considering,
                that there is
                scarce any one thing relating
                to <hi>external
                worship,</hi> but is
                <hi>scrupled</hi>
                or <hi>condemned</hi>
                by some or other. There are those who think it a gross
                piece of <hi>Superstition</hi>
                to erect <hi>publick
                Places,</hi>
                separated
                from all <hi>common</hi> Use, and
                <hi>devoted</hi>
                and <hi>consecrated</hi>
                to the <hi>worship of God,</hi>
                especially
                if they be <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>magnificent,</hi>
                though they think they can never
                sufficiently
                <hi>adorn</hi> their own <hi>houses.</hi>
                Others think it <hi>superstitious</hi> to hear a Sermon
                with their <hi>Hats
                off,</hi> and others judge it <hi>rude</hi> and irreverent
                to <hi>put them
                on;</hi> Some think it a <hi>Sin</hi> to hear a
                <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> others as much condemn
                <hi>extemporary
                Effusions,</hi>
                when men
                say what comes
                next, which is
                not alwayes
                so <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>grave,</hi> so
                becoming
                <hi>Creatures</hi>
                and <hi>Sinners,</hi>
                and so <hi>reverent</hi>
                to Almighty
                God as good men
                <hi>wish.</hi> Some think it <hi>superstitious</hi> to
                confine our selves
                to <hi>kneel</hi> at <hi>Prayers</hi>
                or <hi>Sacrament;</hi> others, <hi>irreverent</hi> to
                <hi>sit.</hi> Taking
                a <hi>Text,</hi> and raising
                <hi>Doctrines</hi>
                and <hi>Uses,</hi>
                and observving
              
              
              <hi>method</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and
                <hi>premeditating</hi>
                before-hand what we have to speak,
                is
                thought by some as great a <hi>quenching</hi>
                and <hi>stifling</hi>
                of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as <hi>praying</hi>
                by a <hi>Form.</hi> Others think the Christian
                Sacraments,
                <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> to be as
                <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>needless,</hi> as some do
                <hi>external Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> in
                <hi>Worship:</hi>
                and there want not those, who think the most
                <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>innocent
                Rites</hi>
                and <hi>Usages</hi>
                to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> when the Observation of
                them
                is
                commanded
                by our <hi>Superiors.</hi>
                While this is
                the <hi>case,</hi> as it certainly
                is
                at this day, I would desire any man to
                shew
                me, how it is
                possible for any Church, of what <hi>denomination</hi>
                soever, whether <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
                or <hi>Independent, &amp;c.</hi> to establish any
                <hi>Rules</hi>
                of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> which shall
                not be <hi>scrupled</hi>
                or <hi>condemned</hi>
                by other Persons,
                and therefore must either have no <hi>Visible Church</hi>
                and <hi>Worship,</hi> or be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                if it make a <hi>man</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> Schismatical,
                to establish any <hi>Rules</hi>
                of <hi>worship,</hi> which some other
                Persons
                think <hi>unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              But to bring this matter to a short issue, it
                is
                evident, that in it self considered
                an
                other man's thinking
                that to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> which I believe to be
                <hi>indifferent</hi>
              
              
              
              and <hi>lawful,</hi> does
                not make it <hi>unlawful</hi>
                to me, any more than my thinking
                such a thing to be <hi>indifferent</hi> and
                <hi>lawful,</hi> makes
                it <hi>lawful</hi> to him,
                who believes
                it to be <hi>unlawful;</hi> and therefore, the Force of
                the <hi>Argument</hi> must lie in this; that by
                imposing
                such Terms
                of Communion, as I believe <hi>indifferent,</hi> but other
                men
                think <hi>unlawful,</hi> I am
                guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> because I force
                them
                to separate, by denying
                them
                Communion,
                unless they will do, what they believe to be unlawful,
                which no honest
                man can or will do.
            </p>
            <p>Now the plain Answer to this,
              consists
              in these three things;
              First, that though such and such particular
              <hi>Rites</hi>
              and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
              are, in their own Nature, <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet
              <hi>publick
              Worship,</hi> and the <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly
              Performance</hi> of <hi>publick
              Worship,</hi> which I have already
              proved,
              cannot be done,
              without some <hi>indifferent</hi>
              and <hi>uncommanded</hi> Circumstances,
              is
              not indifferent.</p>
            <p>
              And secondly,
                That the way to <hi>Union,</hi>
                is
                not by stripping
                Religion of all <hi>indifferent
                Circumstances,</hi>
                for that is
                the way to have no Church, and no
                <hi>publick
                Worship,</hi> but by curing
                mens superstitious
                Conceits
                about them;
                for while
              
              
              men
                believe that things
                <hi>indifferent</hi> are <hi>unlawful</hi> in the Worship
                of God, tho you take away some <hi>indiffernt</hi>
                Rites,
                the same Objection will lie against
                whatever
                is
                set up in the room of them,
                which will cause Divisions
                and Sub-divisions
                without number; as is
                evident in those divided
                Sects,
                which are now among us, who all
                cryed
                out (and do so at this day) against the
                <hi>Impositions,</hi>
                and <hi>Popish Ceremonies</hi>
                of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but could never agree
                about one way of <hi>Worship</hi> and
                <hi>Church-Government</hi> among
                themselves: but some refine the Church, till they refine
                it into <hi>Quakerism;</hi>
                and the reason why others do not so,
                is
                because they have not Wit or Consideration enough to
                understand the Tendency of their own
                Principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              And thirdly,
                It is
                of greater
                Conseq_ence
                to common Christianity, to deliver
                Religion from such superstitious
                Conceits,
                and maintain true Gospel-Liberty, and Freedom, than to
                receive such men
                into the Church, by indulging
                their Superstition. To assert <hi>indifferent
                things</hi>
                to be <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>sinful,</hi>
                is
                as gross Superstition, as it is
                to make such <hi>indifferent things</hi>
                necessary parts
                of Religion,
              
              
              
              and meritorious acts
                of Worship; one is
                the Superstition of the Fanatick,
                the other of the Papist; and the one
                places
                as much Religion in not doing
                <hi>indifferent things,</hi>
                as the other in doing
                them,
                both which are great Corruptions
                of Christianity; one as it destroys
                Christian Liberty, and is
                a necessary Cause of Schisms,
                Confusions,
                and Disorders
                in the Christian Church; and both, as they confound the
                Notions
                of Good and Evil, and nourish men
                in superstitious
                Conceits
                of pleasing
                God, in doing
                or not doing
                something, which, considered
                in it's own Nature, cannot please
                him:
                so that this Dispute about <hi>indifferent
                things,</hi>
                is
                not so trifling,
                as some men
                imagine; and if we cannot keep men
                in, or reduce them
                to the Communion of the Church, without
                forfeiting
                our Christian Liberty, let them
                go, and (according
                to their usual Appeals)
                try it at the last day, who are
                Schismaticks,
                though parting
                with two or three <hi>indifferent
                Ceremonies,</hi>
                is
                of no great Consequence; yet to part with the doctrine of
                the Lawfulness of <hi>indifferent
                things,</hi>
                or to countenance the contrary Doctrine by
                an
                unreasonable and fruitless Complyance
                with such men,
              
              
              is
                to corrupt the Gospel, and to enslave the
                Consciences
                of Christians,
                and this we dare not do for the sake of any man: but this
                is
                abundantly
                enough, in answer
                to our <hi>Inquirers</hi>
                Search for the <hi>Schismatick.</hi>
                But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is
                the most formidable man, a man, who, as a late Author, (I
                had
                called
                him
                <hi>learned,</hi>
                but for fear he should think it
                an
                Abuse, a <hi>counterfeit Epithite,</hi>
                and <hi>fleering
                Expression)</hi>
                tells
                us, is
                neither to be pitied
                nor envyed;
                (and I am
                very much of his mind, for a Reason I know) a man
              
              whose Soul does
                as much excel Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s
                Soul as a <hi>Flint</hi> does
                <hi>Free-stone,</hi> because <hi>Free-stone</hi>
                is
                not so <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>acute,</hi> and will not
                <hi>strike Light;</hi> that is,
                <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Flame,</hi> as <hi>Flint</hi>
                does:
                it is
                a most admirable Comparison, and I
                believe that
                the D. will not envy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                two such Perfections
                as these, the accuteness
                of a <hi>Flint</hi> to divide the Church, and it's
                striking
                Fire to burn and consume it; but the D. may
                comfort
                himself, that <hi>Free-stone</hi>
                is
                fitter to grow into a Holy Temple than <hi>Flint.</hi> But
                he takes
                notice of another Perfection
                of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which is
                indeed the most formidable of any, that he
                has
                <hi>a Pen consequently,
                that is
                but turning
                the Cock,
              
              
              
              and it will run at any time a Sermon full, or a Book full,
                as he hath
                occasion.</hi> This I am
                sure, looks
                like a very fleering
                Expression,
                especially,
                when two Lines
                after, he
                does
                not look upon this as a Perfection,
                but tells
                us, as a Diminution and Qualification of his former
                Encomium,
                that <hi>he is
                usually
                too sudden,</hi> that is,
                that he does
                not sufficiently
                consider what he writes; but however, by this
                means
                he does
                his Business effectually,
                for his Readers
                know not what it is
                he writes, but believe it to be very
                learned
                and profound, and an
                unanswerable Confutation of the Church and
                Churchmen,
                especially
                when they see the Acuteness, the Light and Flame of the
                <hi>Flint</hi> in it, and he tires
                his Adversaries,
                who undertake to answer him,
                by the number of his Books,
                or scorches
                them
                with the Flame.
            </p>
            <p>
              This formidable man has
                lately
                published
                a little Pamphlet, which he calls,
                <hi>A Search after the English Schismatick,</hi>
                at the Conclusion of which, he tells
                us, <hi>I determine not in all this, who
                is
                the</hi> Schismatick,
              
              <hi>but make a pair of Spectacles
                for the purblind to discern it;</hi> so that it
                seems,
                he has
                made
                it so plain, that by the help of these
                Spectacles,
                any man who is
                not
              
              
              stark blind, may see the <hi>Schismatick:</hi>
                but the mischief is,
                no <hi>Spectacles</hi>
                will give a man the sight of himself, otherwise Mr.
                <hi>B.</hi> might have found the
                <hi>Schismatick</hi>
                long since.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I have put on these <hi>Spectacles,</hi>
                and do find, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                sayes,
                that he, who is
                not purblind, may see the <hi>Schismatick;</hi>
                if we do not mean the <hi>same man,</hi> I doubt his
                <hi>Spectacles</hi>
                are not <hi>true;</hi> and, I confess, they
                sometimes
                represent
                things
                <hi>double,</hi> and sometimes
                the very <hi>same man,</hi> if you turn one side of the
                <hi>Spectacles,</hi>
                is
                a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                but if you turn the other side of the
                <hi>Spectacles,</hi>
                he is
                none. As for instance, There are, it
              
              seems,
                a sort of men,
                whom
                he calls
                <hi>passive Conformists,</hi>
                and they are, <hi>such as think a Reformation very
                desirable, but Conformity lawful to escape
                silencing
                and ruine</hi>
                (I suppose he means
                such Conformists,
                if there be any such to be found now, as he
                tells
                us elsewhere, began
                the last Civil Wars
                for a <hi>Reformation</hi>
                without <hi>Bishops</hi>
                or <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and such as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his
                Brethren would have been,
                had
                they been
                taken
                into the Church, and will be, whenever they are) <hi>and
                such as like Conformity for it self, and wish all others
                did
                conform,
              
              
              
              but like not uncharitable Censures,
                or silencings,
                or violence against Conscionable
                Dissenters,
                nor the Compulsions
                which have caused
                our Church-convulsions.</hi>
                I cannot guess who these men
                are, that can answer
                every part of this Character. No honest Conformist, that I
                know of, will approve of <hi>uncharitable
                Censures,</hi>
                nor will exercise any violence against
                <hi>conscionable
                Dissenters,</hi>
                if he could tell who these are; for, I suppose, he would
                not have us to mistake those for
                <hi>conscionable
                Dissenters,</hi>
                who perpetually
                <hi>libel</hi> Church and State, and trample upon all
                Sacred and Civil Authority, and live upon more than the
                Charity of the People,
                to disturb Publick
                Government: but if there be any such
                <hi>Conformists,</hi>
                who would have no restraint laid
                upon <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
                they may well be called
                <hi>passive Conformists,</hi>
                for it is
                no thanks
                to them,
                if they do not suffer once more all the
                Furies
                of a Fanatick
                Rage and Zeal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, but are these <hi>passive
                Conformists,
                Schismaticks,</hi>
                or not <hi>Shismaticks?</hi> The Answer
                is
                plain; <hi>So far as they own the Schismatical
                dividing
                terms
                of Communion,</hi>
                that is,
                so far as they are <hi>Conformists,
                the Nonconformists
                must needs
                judge these
              
              
              to partake in Schism,</hi> that
                is,
                to be <hi>Schismaticks;</hi>
                and this tells
                us what the <hi>Nonconformists</hi>
                judgment
                is,
                even of the <hi>most moderate,</hi> and
                meer
                <hi>passive Conformists,</hi>
                and consequently
                of the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they are
                <hi>Schismaticks;
                yet as they reproach not Dissenters
                as Schismaticks,
                so neither are they accounted
                Schismaticks
                by the Dissenters.</hi>
                This is
                but equal dealing,
                I confess, one good turn requires
                another; the <hi>Conformists</hi>
                indeed are most <hi>generous</hi> in this, because they
                stand in less need of such a Favour; but the Dissenter
                makes
                the greatest
                Complement in excusing
                those from being
                Schismaticks,
                who, as they themselves say, <hi>partake in a Schism,</hi>
                that is,
                who are guilty of <hi>Schism:</hi> and hitherto, I
                always
                thought, that <hi>Schism</hi> denominated
                men
                <hi>Schismaticks;</hi>
                but he gives
                a reason why they do not account these <hi>passive
                Conformists</hi>
                Schismaticks,
                <hi>because they are sound and peaceable brethren, and
                desire to live, as such, with others, and Schism
                is
                not their disposition nor predominant. Sound and
                peaceable,</hi> and yet <hi>Conformists?</hi>
                then there is
                no Heterodoxy in <hi>Conformity,</hi>
                nor <hi>any schismatical dividing
                terms
                of Communion;</hi> for if there be, a
                <hi>Conformist,</hi>
                as a <hi>Conformist,</hi> can neither be
              
              
              
              <hi>sound</hi> nor <hi>peaceable;</hi> and while they
                complement these <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>peaceable
                Conformists,</hi>
                they little consult their own Reputation; for, if
                <hi>Conformists,</hi>
                notwithstanding their <hi>Conformity,</hi> can be
                <hi>sound and peaceable, Nonconformists</hi>
                can be neither, unless they can
                shew
                us two distinct sorts
                of <hi>soundness</hi> and <hi>peaceableness,</hi> one
                peculiar to the <hi>passive Conformist,</hi> the other to
                the <hi>Nonconformist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              To say that a <hi>Conformist</hi>
                is
                no <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                is
                to say that a <hi>Non-conformist</hi>
                is
                one· unless there may be a <hi>Schism,</hi> and
                neither of the <hi>Dividing
                Parties</hi>
                be a <hi>Schismatick;</hi>
                and to say that some <hi>Conformists</hi>
                are <hi>sound and peaceable,</hi>
                is
                to say that all <hi>Nonconformists</hi>
                are <hi>neither;</hi> unless
                two <hi>differing</hi>
                and <hi>dividing
                Parties</hi>
                may be both in the <hi>right,</hi> with respect to that
                very thing wherein they differ. But <hi>Schism
                is
                not their Disposition, nor predominant;</hi> but what
                is
                that to the purpose, since it is
                <hi>Practice,</hi> not <hi>Disposition,</hi>
                which makes
                a Schismatick?
                for he is
                a <hi>Schismatick</hi>
                who makes
                a <hi>Schism,</hi> whether he be
                disposed
                to be a <hi>Schismatick</hi>
                or not; as I suppose none are, but errant
                Knaves,
                who design and endeavour
                to break the <hi>Unity</hi> of the
              
              
              Church, when they are satisfied,
                in their own Consciences,
                that there is
                no reason for
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But however, <hi>Schism is
                not predominant</hi>
                in them;
                that is
                strange, that men
                should be guilty of <hi>actual Schism,</hi> and yet
                <hi>Schism</hi> not be <hi>predominant.</hi> What he
              
              means
                by the <hi>predominancy</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> I
                confess, I cannot tell; for I take <hi>Schism</hi> to be
                then <hi>predominant,</hi> when it
                prevails
                against <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity;</hi> I find indeed,
                that he has
                a very odd Notion of <hi>Schism,</hi> that it
                <hi>has
                a great number of degrees,</hi>
                insomuch th__
                <hi>few Churches
                on earth are no way guilty of Schism, and yet are not to
                be called
                Schismaticks,
                where it is
                not predominant.</hi> Now though I will
                readily
                grant, that Schism may have different
                degrees
                of <hi>guilt,</hi> according
                to different <hi>circumstances</hi>
                and <hi>aggravations,</hi>
                yet <hi>Schism</hi> being
                nothing else but a breach of <hi>Christian Communion,</hi>
                or dividing
                our selves
                from the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> the
                nature of it is
                the same in <hi>all,</hi> and is
                not capable of less, or greater
                degrees,
                or, as the <hi>Logicians</hi>
                speak, <hi>non recipit magis &amp; minus:</hi> it may be a
                greater
                or less <hi>Schism,</hi> with respect
                to the number of the <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                its
                <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>extent,</hi> or the difficulty
              
              
              
              of the Cure, but it cannot be more or less a Schism; for
                where the Unity of the Church is
                broke
                by distinct and opposite
                Communions,
                there is
                the full nature of <hi>Schism,</hi> which
                is
                as much <hi>Schism</hi> as <hi>Schism</hi> can be
                <hi>Schism;</hi> and where this
                is
                not, there is
                either no <hi>Schism,</hi> or only
                a partial <hi>Schism,</hi> which
                is
                like a great Wound in the Arm, which yet
                does
                not sever it from the Body; as when
                men
                refuse to communicate in some parts
                and offices
                of <hi>Christian Worship,</hi> not in all; or if they
                refuse Christian Communion, yet set up no <hi>opposite
                Church</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi>
                of their own. It is
                not every different Opinion, not every Error or Mistake,
                not every Quarrel or Contention,
                as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> imagines,
                which makes
                a <hi>Schism,</hi> but the Breach of
                Christian
                Communion; and where there is
                such a Breach, there is
                certainly
                a <hi>Schism</hi> on one side or other.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next sort of men
                Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> taxes
                with Schism, are the <hi>Sectaries</hi>
                and <hi>Separatists,</hi>
                and by them
                he means
                those, <hi>who 1. appropriate the Church to some
                narrow Sect or
                Party, which denieth
                all others to be true Churches,
                or to have true Ministers
                or Sacraments.</hi>
                Upon this Principle, I remember St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                disputes
                against
              
              
              the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
                who confined
                the Church of Christ to <hi>Africa,</hi> where their
                Church was,
                and to their own Communion, but
                denied
                that there was
                a true Church in any part of the World
                besides,
                excepting
                here and there some few Conventicles
                of the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
                Now, this Argument
                certainly
                extends
                to all times,
                as well as to all places;
                for to appropriate the Church to this last Age, and to
                deny all the
                Churches
                of the Christian World, for 14 or 15 hundred
                years,
                to be true Churches,
                is
                a much greater
                Confinement of the Church, than it
                is
                now to appropriate it to any one Sect or Party; and yet,
                this all those are guilty of, who
                condem
                and separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon
                account of
                <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy, Liturgies,</hi>
                or <hi>indifferent Ceremonies,</hi>
                unless they can, for 1500 years
                after the Apostles,
                shew
                us a Christian Church, without <hi>Bishops,
                Liturgies,</hi>
                or <hi>Ceremonies;</hi>
                for upon the same Reason, that they separate from the
                Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are
                Schismaticks
                from the whole Christian Church for so many
                Ages;
                for I challenge this admirable <hi>Ecclesiastical
                Historian</hi> to shew
                me any one Church since the time of the
                Apostles,
                wherein there was
                no <hi>Diocesan
              
              
              
              Bishops</hi>
                a more reformed
                <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and fewer
                and more <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi>
                than are now in use in the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
                Nay, if to <hi>appropriate the Church to some narrow Sect
                and Party, which denieth
                all others to be true Churches,
                or to have true Ministers
                or Sacraments,</hi>
                be the Character of a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                both <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
                and <hi>Independents,</hi>
                as well as the <hi>Episcopal,</hi> who assert the divine
                Right and Apostolical Institution of their
                Churches
                and Ministry against all other Church-forms
                of Government, are down right <hi>Schismaticks:</hi>
                for he that asserts,
                that there is
                but one Church of divine Institution, must deny all other
                Churches
                or Ministers
                to be of divine Institution; that
                is,
                to be true Churches
                or Ministers;
                unless, when Christ has
                instituted
                a Church, and a Ministry, there may be true
                Churches
                and Ministers,
                which are not of Christ's Institution.
                But of all the <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
                that ever I heard
                of, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself,
                according
                to these Principles,
                did
                he understand,
                and pursue any, is
                the greatest,
                who sets
                up such a <hi>parochial Episcopacy,</hi>
                which is
                a compounded
                Creature of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi>
                as never was
                practised
                in any Church yet in the
              
              
              World, which, if he dare stand to it, that this
                is
                the only true Apostolical Government, must unchurch all
                the Churches
                that ever were
                in the World.
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is
              so far out in this Character
              of a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
              that the <hi>quite contrary</hi>
              to what he says,
              is
              the <hi>true Character
              of a Schismatick,</hi>
              if it will admit any Notion of Schism. For to assert, that
              there are more true Churches
              than one, (how large or narrow soever, the
              bounds
              of it be) which were
              not very large in the first Institution of a Church, and may
              be reduced
              again to a narrow Compass by a general
              Apostacy)
              is
              to justifie
              Schism by a Law; for then there may be distinct
              Churches,
              and distinct and opposite Communions
              without Schism, which is
              the most <hi>schismatical
              Principle</hi> in the World, if Christ have but one Church
              and one Body, and if breaking
              the Unity of this Church be Schism; of which more
              hereafter.</p>
            <p>
              Hence we see, how little Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                understands
                the nature of <hi>Schism,</hi> (I wish he
                were
                as ignorant in the Practice of it) when he
                makes
                it to consist in <hi>appropriating
                the Church to some Sect or Party;</hi> that
                is,
                to one <hi>Communion,</hi> which
                is
                the
              
              
              
              only <hi>Principle of Christian Union,</hi> and the
                denying
                of it, a <hi>necessary</hi> cause of
                <hi>Schisms</hi>
                and <hi>Confusions:</hi>
                and yet we may observe further, that though this
                were
                a <hi>schismatical Principle,</hi> yet nothing
                makes
                a man a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                but a sinful Separation from a true Church; and this alone
                will make a man a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                let his Principles
                be what they will.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to proceed, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s next
                Character
                of a <hi>Sectarian Schismatick,</hi>
                is
                more strange than this, which is
                expressed
                in these Words;
                2. <hi>And next to those, that though they own others as
                true Churches
                or Ministers,
                yet hold their Communion unlawful, when it
                is
                not so, and renounce Communion with
                them
                upon these Grounds:</hi>
                If by <hi>other Churches,</hi>
                Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means
                <hi>Parochial,
                Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>national Churches,</hi>
                who profess the same <hi>Faith,</hi> and live under the
                same Government and Discipline, unless with such Variety
                as the time and place, and inevitable necessity of
                Affairs
                requires
                and exacts
                from them;
                I say, to separate from, or to deny
                Communion
                with such true Churches
                and Ministers,
                is
                a Schism; though I believe, no man
                was
                ever guilty of it, who held
                Communion with any Church, unless, <hi>Such People as talk
                through the Windows
              
              
              on the West-side of</hi> More-fields,
                to use Mr.
              
              <hi>B</hi>'s. elegant Paraphrases,
                for mad-men:
                but if by true Churches
                he means
                opposite
                Churches,
                who set up distinct and separate
                Communions
                of their own, which is
                the Case of the <hi>Presbyterian, Independent,</hi> and
                other Sectarian Churches,
                who are formed
                in opposition to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to
                one another, as it is
                plain, he intends
                it: if these <hi>different</hi>
                Parties
                think the other Churches
                true Churches,
                and their Communion lawful, their very
                dividing
                into separate Communions
                is
                Schism, and they have no other way of
                justifying
                their Separation,
                but by <hi>holding
                their Communion unlawful:</hi>
                for to renounce a lawful Communion,
                when we our selves
                believe it to be lawful, is
                certainly
                a sinful Separation,
                if there be any such thing as Schism; but to renounce a
                Communion because we believe it unlawful, though it
                is
                a Schism, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> truly
                says,
                <hi>when it is
                not so,</hi> (which should make all our
                <hi>Dissenters</hi>
                more impartially
                exaamine
                upon what accounts
                Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                is
                unlawful)
                yet the only Excuse they can possibly
                make for themselves, is
                their Mistake,
                that they did
                sincerely
                believe
              
              
              
              such a Communion to be unlawful, when it
                was
                not so, and therefore separated;
                which, how far it shall be accepted,
                God, who only knows
                the hearts
                of men,
                will judge at the last day.
            </p>
            <p>But we must consider, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              means
              by <hi>Communion,</hi> when he makes
              it schismatical for those of opposite
              Churches
              and Communions,
              to renounce Communion
              with each other, especially,
              upon Pretence of
              the Unlawfulness of such Communion: for can a man be a
              member of two
              different Churches,
              which have their distinct and opposite
              Pastors,
              Government, Rules
              of Worship and Discipline? A Member suppose, of the
              <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi>
              Church, all at one time, what need then can there be, for
              such distinct Churches?
              Why do they not all unite into one Church?
              <hi>Separation</hi> is
              certainly
              causless
              and sinful, when we separate from any Church, with
              whom
              we can lawfully
              communicate, and to communicate with such opposite
              Churches,
              either signifies
              that we are of no Church, or that by
              Turns
              we are <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
              and <hi>Separatists</hi>
              from them
              all.</p>
            <p>
              But, I suppose, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                means
                by <hi>Communion,</hi> is
                no more but this, That,
              
              
              though men
                are fixed
                and setled
                Members
                of one particular Church, <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
                suppose, or <hi>Independent,</hi> yet they may
                occasionally
                be present at <hi>Episcopal</hi>
                Churches,
                not as <hi>Members,</hi>
                but to joyn
                in some <hi>parts
                of Worship,</hi> or to hear a Sermon; but such occasional
                presence is
                very far from being
                in <hi>Communion</hi> with such a Church, as the
                <hi>Dean</hi> has
                already
              
              proved,
                and I shall have occasion
                to discourse more hereafter: and therefore, if Mr.
                <hi>B.</hi> say true, those are all
                <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                who believe <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church of
                England</hi> to be <hi>lawful,</hi>
                and yet renounce her <hi>Communion;</hi> that
                is,
                refuse to be <hi>Church-members,</hi>
                and to submit to her Rules
                of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> as if her
                <hi>Communion</hi> were
                <hi>unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              The next sort of men
                he taxes,
                are, the <hi>Active Canonical Conformists,</hi>
                viz.
              
              <hi>Those that are for the present Form of
                Ecclesiastical
                Government, with the Litany and
                Canons,
                and the Laws
                which enforce them
                (who call usually
                for the execution of those Laws)</hi>
                these he very civilly
                calls
                <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi>
                by which, I fear he mistakes
                them
                for <hi>Army Saints.</hi>
                The only
                difference between these men
                and the second sort of <hi>passive
                Conformists,</hi>
                is,
              
              
              
              that, it seems,
                they <hi>are for the Laws</hi>
                which enforce <hi>Conformity,</hi> and
                <hi>usually
                call for the execution of those
                Laws.</hi>
                And be it so, this cannot make a man a
                <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                that he lives
                in Communion with a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>pure</hi>
                Church, and desires
                to see it preserved
                from the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous
                Outrages</hi>
                of <hi>Popery and Fanaticism.</hi>
                Is
                it <hi>Schism</hi> to approve what our
                Governours,
                the King and Parliament, do for the Establishment of our
                <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion?</hi>
                But, who told
                him
                that these <hi>Active Conformists</hi>
                do so often call for the <hi>Execution</hi> of these
                <hi>Laws?</hi>
                Has
                he seen
                any such thing in the <hi>Fast-Sermons</hi>
                before the House of <hi>Commons,</hi>
                since the <hi>King</hi>'s Return? Will he venture to
                compare the two last twenty years
                together,
                and let them
                go for the <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                who have cried
                <hi>oftenest</hi>
                and <hi>loudest</hi>
                for the <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi>
                and pulling
                up <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch?</hi> I will tell Mr.
                <hi>B.</hi> a Secret which I have
                heard,
                but hope he will not make me prove it, that the
                <hi>Parliament</hi> made
                good Laws,
                <hi>Papists</hi>
                (out of a pretended
                reverence to tender Consciences)
                hindred
                the <hi>Execution</hi> of them,
                and some <hi>leading
                Fanaticks</hi>
                had
                <hi>private
                encouragement,</hi> to say no more, to set up a mighty cry
                of <hi>Persecution,</hi> to cast all
              
              
              the <hi>odium</hi> on a <hi>persecuted
                Church,</hi> and <hi>Diocesan
                Canoneers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us now consider who his <hi>meer</hi>
              
              <hi>Nonconformists</hi>
                are, whom
                he endeavours
                to excuse from <hi>Schism;</hi> and by
                them,
                he tells
                us, he <hi>means
                such as are guilty of no other punishable
                Errours
                or Sins,
                but such as the Act of Uniformity doth eject and silence
                us for:</hi> that is,
                Disobedience to Civil Government, and Ecclesiastical
                Constitutions;
                such little petty matters
                as cannot make a man a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                especially
                such a perfect man, as <hi>is
                guilty of no other punishable Errours
                or Sins.</hi>
                But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when it will serve his turn,
                knows
                a certain distinction between <hi>passive</hi> and
                <hi>active,</hi> which might be much better
                applied
                to Non-conformists
                than to Conformists.
                A <hi>passive</hi> Nonconformist
                is
                one, who is
                ejected
                and silenced,
                but joyns
                in publick
                Worship as far as he can, but does
                not set up distinct and opposite
                Churches,
                and these are properly
                <hi>meer
                Non-conformists:</hi>
                such as the ancient Non-conformists
                were,
                who left their Livings,
                but did
                not leave the Church, but conformed
                as Lay-men,
                though not as publick
                Ministers;
                and if he means
                such, by <hi>meer
                Non-conformists,</hi>
                far be it from me to charge them
                with Schism.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
              But <hi>active Nonconformists</hi>
                are those, who, though they are
                ejected,
                yet will not be silenced,
                but separate from the Church, and set up Schismatical
                <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
                and preach People into Scruples
                and Factions;
                and such are the men,
                whom
                he describes
                in the following
                words,
                <hi>who declared
                openly
                their judgments
                about Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline,
                in 1660. after a common meeting
                at</hi> Sion Colledge,
                <hi>and another at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>which
                is
                publish'd in print:</hi> For all these
                Persons,
                even Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself, have
                actually
                separated
                from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                if setting
                up opposite Churches
                and Conventicles
                be a Separation; and I could tell
                him
                of another meeting,
                when they secretly
                declared
                their judgments,
                which is
                not published
                in print: for, some men,
                I can assure him,
                have a publick
                and a private Conscience; But these, he
                sayes,
                <hi>are the Reconcilers,
                or Peace-makers,
                who then laboured
                and begged
                for Peace and Unity in vain;</hi> that
                is,
                who were
                very desirous of Union, if they could have
                had
                it upon their own terms;
                And, I think all Conformists
                and Non-conformists
                whatsoever, <hi>passive</hi> or <hi>active,</hi> are such
                kind of Peace-makers
                and Reconcilers
                as these, though
              
              
              I hope there are not many of them,
                would write such Pleas
                for Peace as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
                done,
                who has
                contended
                so earnestly
                for Peace, that he has
                cast all the Dirt that he could
                possibly
                rake together,
                upon Church and State, that no impartial Judge can
                discover any thing but a Spirit of Wrath,
                Reviling,
                Sedition,
                and Schism, in his whole Book. Such a Reconciler and
                Peace-maker is
                Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who declares
                eternal War against the Church of <hi>England:</hi> he
                calls
                the
              
              present Constitution of the Church, <hi>A
                separating
                Wall, or dividing
                thorny Hedge in the midst of this part of the Vineyard of
                Christ, to separate one part of the faithful
                Ministers
                and People from the rest;</hi> and
                professes,
                <hi>That he once made
                it the most earnest
                Action of his Life, to have prevented
                the building of this Wall, or Hedge,</hi> that
                is,
                the Establishment of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> this
                was
                in 1660. when he tells
                us, they did
                so heartily
                beg for Peace; and here he expounds,
                what their beging
                for Peace meant,
                that the Church of <hi>England</hi> should not be set up;
                and he adds,
                that he will, if possibly
                he can, pull it down again; <hi>And that I as
                earnestly
                desire to see that Wall or Hedge pull'd down, that
                Christ's Flock
              
              
              
              among us, may be one, and I will do the best I can, while
                I live, to pull it down, that there may be no such
                Separation.</hi> Sir, we heartily
                thank you, for telling
                us so, and more especially,
                for telling
                us the way you will take to effect it, <hi>by
                going
                on both sides
                of the Hedge, though by so doing,
                you be scratch'd;</hi> that is,
                by sometimes
                going
                to Church, and oftner
                preaching
                at a Conventicle; so that his coming
                to our Church, is
                but like <hi>Judas</hi> his Kiss, with a Design to betray
                it, which out of a Catholick
                Spirit, he does
                only till he can get the Wall down, which at present
                is
                beyond his Power, and then farewel
                the Church of <hi>England</hi> for ever. But of all
                men,
                there are no such dangerous Enemies
                as those in our Bosoms,
                as <hi>Cataline</hi>
                was
                more terrible and dangerous to <hi>Rome,</hi> while he
                was
                in the City, than when he had
                drawn
                his Forces
                out; which is
                a mighty Encouragement
                to all men,
                who love the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to make
                breaches
                in her Walls
                for those men
                to enter, who when they are in, will never leave, till
                they have laid
                all level.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he proceeds
                in his Character of
              
              these <hi>meer
                Non-conformists,
                that they tye
                themselves to the Judgments
                of none, called
              
              
              Non-conformists
                heretofore, Presbyterians,
                Independents,</hi>
                &amp;c. This I confess is
                true, they have forsaken
                the Principles
                of the old Non-conformists,
                who were
                true <hi>passive Non-conformists,</hi>
                who lived
                peaceably
                in the Communion of the Church, and
                confuted
                the <hi>Separatists</hi>
                of those days,
                and the <hi>meer
                Non-conformists</hi>
                of our days;
                and therefore, it was
                high time to quit their Principles,
                and if they were
                honest, they should not glory
                in their names
                neither. But I do not see, how this
                makes
                them
                ever the less, but more, <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                that they have departed
                from their Principles,
                who were
                meer
                Non-conformists,
                but were
                not <hi>Separatists.</hi>
                Indeed, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> represents
                himself and his Brethren, I do not see, that they are in
                Communion with any Church at all, or have
                concluded
                upon any form of Church-Government;
                but while they pretend to be <hi>Catholick
                Christians,</hi>
                are <hi>Catholick
                Separatists,</hi>
                for they are neither <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
                nor <hi>Independents,</hi>
                or at least, not such as the old
                ones
                were:
                Well, are they <hi>Episcopal?</hi> Their Separation
                gives
                us no great reason to think so, and yet they should be so,
                if what follows,
                be true; that they tye
                themselves <hi>to the
              
              
              
              Word of God, and the example of the true Primitive
                Churches:</hi>
                As for the Word of God, he knows
                very well, that this is
                pretended
                on all sides,
                right or wrong; the <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian,
                Independent</hi> Churches,
                all pretend a <hi>Jus divinum;</hi> but when he
                adds,
                <hi>And the Example of the true Primitive
                Churches,</hi>
                if there be no Fallacy in it, he must be
                ours:
                for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is
                the only Government according
                to the Word of God, as expounded
                by Primitive Practise, as I must believe, till he can
                shew
                me a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi>
                Church, in the Ages
                next after the Apostles.
                For, if by the true Primitive Churches,
                he means
                only the Churches
                in the Apostles
                days,
                he does
                not deal sincerely
                in distinguishing
                the Word of God, from the Example of the true Primitive
                Churches;
                for there is
                no way to know what the Churches
                in the Apostles
                time were,
                but by the Word of God; that is,
                the Historical Account we have of it in Scripture, which,
                it seems,
                is
                not so plain, but the differing
                Parties
                can put their own Fancies
                on it, and wrangle about the Signification of those
                names,
                <hi>Bishops,
                Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon.</hi> But, if we will
                suppose that Government which
              
              
              the Apostles
                instituted,
                was
                continued
                and preserved
                in those true Primitive Churches,
                which immediately
                succeeded
                the Age of the Apostles,
                (which is
                but very reasonable to think) then the whole matter
                is
                very plain, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
                is
                an
                Apostolical Institution, not a <hi>Parochial
                Independent,</hi> but a true <hi>Diocesan
                Canoneering Episcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              For a Conclusion of this Character of the
                <hi>meer
                present Non-conformist,</hi> he
                adds,
                <hi>And are not for Concord only with a Sect, or a
                dividing
                Party, high or low, but for that
                Catholick
                Church, and Communion of Saints,
                which are in our Creed.</hi> This
                is
                surprizing!
                What he means
                by <hi>Concord,</hi> I cannot tell; but, when he
                speaks
                of Church <hi>Concord,</hi> he ought to mean Communion,
                and then by his own Confession,
                he and his Brethren are for holding
                Church-Communion with Sects
                and dividing
                Parties;
                and consequently,
                if any of these Sects,
                and dividing
                Parties
                are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                he is
                so too; unless
                he can communicate in <hi>Schism,</hi> without
                being
                a <hi>Schismatick:</hi>
                and, it is
                strange, if none of the dividing
                Parties
                should be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                or that he should escape the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> who
                countenances
                all, by communicating
                with all;
              
              
              
              an
                admirable way to <hi>Catholick
                Unity:</hi> here is
                Latitudinarianism with a Witness.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, still they are <hi>for the
                Catholick
                Church, and Communion of Saints,
                which are in our Creed,</hi> and,
                truly
                there it must keep according
                to these Principles;
                for it is
                never likely to be seen
                in the World, where we have such
                <hi>meer
                Non-conformists</hi>
                among us. It is
                a wonderful
                Catholick
                Church, which is
                made
                up of a great many dividing
                Sects
                and Parties,
                which hold no Communion with one another, but are
                tacked
                together,
                by such <hi>meer
                Non-conformists,</hi>
                as are Christians
                at large, Members
                of no particular Church, but for the
                Catholick
                Church in the Creed. And thus Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                proceeds
                to the Question, which he puts
                into these, <hi>Our Question</hi>
              
              <hi>now is
                of two Parties
                here, the</hi> Canoneer,
                Diocesan Conformists,
                <hi>and present</hi> meer
                Non-conformists,
                <hi>which are the</hi> English Schismaticks.
                Now, I must confess, I know not how to deal with Mr.
                <hi>B.</hi> here; for, he has,
                of late days,
                pitched
                upon a very cunning way of Writing,
                not by Reasons
                and Arguments,
                and a fair debate of the case in Difference, but by
                stating
                Cases,
                and giving
                Historical
              
              
              Accounts
                of their Judgment
                and Opinions,
                and Practises,
                without drawing
                any Inference, but leaving
                his Readers
                to make Application, according
                to their own Fancies
                and Interests;
                and then if you apply any thing he
                says,
                to the Business of <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> or
                <hi>Schism,</hi> and shew,
                that there is
                no force at all in it, you are presently
                answered
                with a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> you lie
                Sir, as they say, one confuted
                <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of old: that
                is,
                he will state a case, as he calls
                it, by heaping
                up all the vilest
                and most spiteful Insinuations,
                that can be thought on, to bespatter the
                Government
                and present Constitutions
                in Church and State; but these must not be
                called
                the Reasons
                of his Non-conformity,
                but an
                History of matter of Fact, which are not his
                Reasons,
                till he has
                formed
                them
                into Mode and Figure: and now, whoever
                goes
                to answer him,
                and produces
                these as his Reasons
                of Non-conformity, is
                turn'd off with a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> for fear of
                <hi>tiring
                his Readers,
                by turning
                a Mentiris</hi> (or an
                <hi>English Lie) into a civil long Parenthesis.</hi> Thus
                he has
                served
                the <hi>Impleader</hi> of his <hi>Plea for</hi>
              
              <hi>Peace,</hi> and, thus he says,
                he has
                served
                some others, <hi>but has
                forborne
                it with others
              
              
              
              far more guilty, least their Reverence and Power, should
                make truth intolerable, whose Passion or Interest, or
                Error, had
                made
                gross Lies
                seem true and necessary.</hi> We may
                easily
                guess, what Reverend Person he means,
                and I am
                afraid, his Civility to him
                has
                lost
                his Cause, for he will never be able to give
                him
                a more convincing
                Answer, while his Eyes
                are open.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is
                really
                and truly
                a great piece of Art, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ought to
                have the Glory of the Invention; for by this
                means,
                he effectually
                promotes
                his Design,
                which is
                to load the Church of <hi>England</hi> with
                Reproaches,
                and to justifie
                their Schism among their own Party, who understand their
                Cant; and if any busie
                pragmatical Scribler,
                as I may be at this time, shall venture to answer
                him,
                there is
                nothing to be answered,
                but his <hi>Historical Mistakes:</hi>
                for he will allow no body to turn his History into
                Arguments,
                but himself; who will be sure never to do it, or his
                trusty Friends,
                who will be sure to like them;
                and one good graceful <hi>Mentiris,</hi> or we will
                allow
                him
                twenty or thirty, because he can seldom stop under, shall
                be an
                un-answerable Answer to all his
                Impleaders.
              
              
              And yet this is
                as arrant a Juggle and <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> trick, as ever
                was
                plaid in <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair; for, as the
                <hi>Impleader</hi> well urged,
                <hi>if the History be given
                in Answer to him
                that demandeth
                the Reasons,
                then the History containeth
                these</hi>
              
              <hi>Reasons,</hi>
                Negatur sequela, says
                Mr. <hi>B. The matter of Fact must go first; the
                Bishop
                demanded
                of me, an
                account of our</hi> Non-conformity, <hi>this
                is
                the beginning
                of an
                Answer, the Reasons
                must come next.</hi> Now, how the matter of Fact can be so
                much as the beginning
                of an
                Answer, which contains
                no Reasons,
                is
                past my Understanding;
                unless, it be familiar with them,
                to write large books
                for the beginning
                of an
                Answer, which contains
                no Reasons.
                When men
                argue from matters
                of Fact, the matter of Fact must be one Term in the
                Syllogism, and if matter
                of Fact be not part of the Argument, it
                is
                impertinent and trifling:
                As for Instance,
                if we should frame an
                Argument
                thus,
            </p>
            <p><hi>We must not submit to sinful
              Terms
              of Communion, but renouncing
              the Covenant, owning
              the Authority of Diocesan Bishops,
              using
              the Liturgy, and any symbolical
              Ceremonies,</hi>
              &amp;c. <hi>are sinful Terms
              of Communion:</hi>
              Ergo, <hi>We must not submit to
              them.</hi></p>
            
            
            
            <p>And therefore, he who gives
              an
              <hi>Historical
              Account</hi> of the Terms
              of Communion,
              and his Scruples
              about it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a
              beginning
              of an
              Answer to that Question, Why do you not conform? must be
              supposed
              to alledge
              these matters
              of Fact, as the Basis and Foundation of his Reason, if he
              will be so nice, as not to call it a Reason; for, if it be
              no part of his Reason, it is
              nothing to the purpose, no more than the
              Adventures
              of some Knight Errant.</p>
            <p>
              The same Method he has
                taken
                in his <hi>Search</hi> for the <hi>English
                Schismatick;</hi>
                he has
                <hi>not determined
                who he is,
                but made
                a pair of Spectacles
                for the purblind to see it,</hi> and this he
                has
                done
                by stating
                the case of the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi>
                and <hi>the meer
                present Non-conformists.</hi>
                No doubt, but he intends
                to prove the Diocesan Canoneers,
                to be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                for I cannot
                think, he designs
                to prove himself to be one, and, therefore he
                has
                stated
                their case, in a hundred and four
                Particulars,
                which is
                the Indictment against them,
                to prove them
                to be <hi>Schismaticks;</hi>
                and yet I greatly
                suspect, that whoever shall examine all these
                Particulars,
                and shew,
                that they are either false as to matter of Fact, or that
                they will not
              
              
              bear the Charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> shall be
                answered,
                as the <hi>Impleader</hi> was,
                with a <hi>Mentiris;</hi> for he
                has
                only given
                an
                <hi>Historical
                account</hi> of their Case, but
                has
                not yet given
                his Reasons
                to prove them
                <hi>Schismaticks;</hi>
                for Spectacles
                are not Reasons,
                but an
                artificial Instrument to make invisible
                Reasons
                visible to the purblind; and therefore, I shall not
                pretend to
                answer them
                as Reasons,
                but only shew,
                that his Spectacles
                are false: and, because I perceive they are of a
                multiplying,
                as well as magnifying,
                Nature, I
                shall reduce his hundred and four
                Heads
                of Accusation, to some few Particulars,
                and give a very short Answer to
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first Head of Accusation is,
                That we have a great many different
                Opinions
                among our selves;
                as 1. <hi>About the essentiating
                Head of our own national Church. 2. Whether
                Bishops
                be necessary to the Being
                of a Church, or only to the Well-being
                of it:</hi> and the annexed
                Controversies
                about it, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>about the
                Points
                called</hi>
                ARMINIAN; 12. <hi>About Original Sin; 85. About the
                Imputation
                of Christ's Righteousness; 86. About God's eternal
                Decrees;
                87. About Universal Redemption; 88. The nature
              
              
              
              of justifying
                Faith; 89. Sufficient Grace; 90.
                Distinguishing
                Grace; 91. The Perseverance
                of the Justified;
                92. The Religious
                use of</hi> LENT; 96. <hi>The Morality of the Sabbath; 97.
                About subject Presbyters,
                and the different Sense of the Word</hi> PRESBYTER
                <hi>and</hi> BISHOP. 8. 9. 102.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, all these he calls
                <hi>Schisms
                among</hi>
              
              <hi>themselves, which are too many to be here
                numbred;</hi>
                that is,
                That all men
                who differ in their private Opinions,
                are <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
                from one another, though they live in the same Communion,
                and preserve the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.
                But this is
                a perfect Fanatick
                Notion of Schism, agreeable to their Practice, who divide
                the Church for every trifling
                Difference in Opinion, and is
                a plain Argument, that even such a flinty Soul, as his
                Encomiast says
                Mr. B. has,
                has
                it's obtuse and blind, as well as it's acute and
                light-striking
                side.
            </p>
            <p>
              And, therefore I shall first mind
                him,
                that his admired
                Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
                himself, will not allow Schism to consist in
                differing
                Opinions,
                but in the erecting
                a new Church and Oratory, for the
                dividing
                Party to meet in publickly
                (the exact case of our meer
                Non-conforming
                Separatists)
              
              
              as in the late famous Controversie
                in <hi>Holland, de Praedestinatione</hi>
                (which Mr. B. instances
                in, and, according
                to his dividing
                Faculty, distinguishes
                into as many Heads,
                as he could think on) as long as the
                disagreeing
                Parties,
                went
                no farther than Disputes;
                the Schism was
                unhatched,
                but as soon as one Party swept
                an
                old Cloyster,
                and, by a pretty Art, made
                it a Church, (by putting
                a new Pulpit in it) for the separating
                Party to meet in, what before was
                a Controversie,
                became
                a formal Schism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly,
                I would desire him
                to consider,
                that according
                to this Principle, there never was
                a Church in the World, at least, not in these last
                inquisitive Ages,
                but was
                made
                up of Schismaticks,
                not his own beloved
                Catholick
                spirited
                Conventicles
                excepted;
                for excepting
                some few Dreams
                and Fancies
                of his own, (which never troubled
                any man's Head, till he put them
                in) these controverted
                Doctrines,
                which he here mentions,
                have always
                been
                disputed,
                and will be so to the end of the World, and these
                men,
                who glory in Conquest, and affect to be the
                Heads
                of Parties,
                or place Religion
                more in Orthodox Opinions,
                than
              
              
              
              in the Virtues
                of a Christian Life; separate
                upon this account, and turn formal
                Schismaticks.
                Are not all these Disputes
                as hotly
                managed
                among Dissenters,
                as among the Episcopal Clergy? (witness the Dispute about
                Mr. B's. <hi>Aphorisms
                of Justification, John Goodwin's
                Redemption redeemed,</hi>
                and the late rude Assaults
                made
                upon Mr. <hi>How)</hi> and why then,
                was
                not this put into the Case of the
                meer
                Non-conformists,
                as well as the Diocesan Canoneers?
                I will not tell the Reason, but every Body may guess it.
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,
              if he had
              dealt
              fairly,
              he should have told
              us, which of these different
              Parties
              had
              been
              the Schismaticks;
              for, if two distinct men,
              or Parties
              of men,
              hold contradictory Opinions,
              and this is
              schismatical, both these cannot be
              Schismaticks,
              unless both parts
              of a Contradiction
              be true, or Truth it self will make a man a
              Schismatick,
              if it should happen, that another man
              holds
              a contrary
              Error: this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
              did
              not dare meddle with, least he should have
              cleared
              his Diocesan Canoneers,
              and cast the Schism upon his meer
              Non-conforming
              Brethren, who are not many of them,
              of his mind in these matters.</p>
            
            
            <p>Fourthly,
              I fear, according
              to this Principle, Mr. B. will be found the
              greatest
              Schismatick
              in nature; for there are very few
              men
              in the World, that agree with him,
              or he with them:
              nay, some say, that he has
              very often been
              a Schismatick
              to himself, and very seldom
              agrees
              long together with his own Judgment.</p>
            <p>
              And fifthly,
                to take notice at present of no other particular
                Accusation, his first Charge is
                very pleasant, <hi>They agree not of the
                essentiating
                Head of their own national Church, whether it be Lay or
                Clergy, King
                or Bishop, (and so are, indeed, of
                divers
                Churches)
                no, nor whether it have any constitutive Head or
                none.</hi> This is
                a most ridiculous Conceit of Mr. B. as you shall hear more
                hereafter; but, supposing
                the thing were
                true, that we were
                not agreed
                about these matters,
                how does
                this prove us to be of divers
                Churches,
                when we all communicate in the same Church, and in the
                same holy Offices,
                and give all that Authority
                to the King in Ecclesiastical matters,
                which Christian Kings
                and Princes
                have ever enjoyed,
                and which our Laws
                grant him,
                and pay that Reverence and Subjection to
                Bishops,
                which is
                due to
              
              
              
              them
                by Catholick
                Practice, and Ecclesiastical
                Canons,
                and the present Constitutions
                of our Church? But, because we cannot agree about the
                meaning
                of a cramp, metaphysical Term (which it may be,
                has
                no meaning)
                <hi>An
                essential constitutive Head,</hi> therefore we must be of
                divers
                Churches,
                which is
                just like the wise Dispute about the principle of
                Individuation, which at this rate of
                arguing,
                must make Mr. B. as many divers
                men
                (setting
                aside the diversity of his Opinions)
                as there are different Judgments
                about it: or, to put a plainer
                case than this, because there are
                different
                Opinions
                of the Subjects
                of this Realm, about the nature of it's
                Government,
                whether the King, suppose, be one of the three
                Estates,
                or a Superiour
                Head to them
                all; therefore the men
                who differ in their Opinions
                about these matters,
                do not belong to the same, but to
                divers
                Kingdoms.
                If Mr. B. will not blush at this, I will blush for
                him;
                and, how parallel this Case is,
                will appear from considering
                his second head of Accusations,
                which concern the differing
                Opinions
                about Civil Government,
                which he says,
                were
                entertain'd by Church men,
                above forty years
                ago,
              
              
              <hi>about Prerogative, Laws,
                and Property, 19. &amp;c.</hi> And, from hence he
                takes
                occasion to
                give an
                account of the Original
                of our late Civil Wars,
                which is
                not my Business at present to consider, but I leave that
                to those, who are concerned
                to prevent another. But cannot men
                differ about Civil Government, but they must be
                Schismaticks
                from the Church, as well as Rebels
                against the State? If there be different
                Opinions
                among Churchmen,
                about these matters,
                who live still in the Communion of the same Church, how
                does
                this make them
                Schismaticks?
                Is
                it made
                a necessary term of Church-Communion, to
                determine
                the Dispute about Prerogative, Laws,
                and Property? Or, is
                the Church of <hi>England</hi> schismatical, because it
                asserts
                a just Obedience to Government, and
                has
                always
                been
                Loyal to Princes?
                I beseech you Sir, tell us, which Party of these
                differing
                Diocesan Canoneers
                were
                the Schismaticks,
                and then we may guess, which were
                the Rebels
                too; there were
                indeed, in those days,
                a great many
                <hi>active Canoneering Diocesans,</hi>
                (if we will believe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who
                says,
                the War was
                begun
                by Conformists)
                whom
                now he modesty calls
                <hi>passive Conformists;</hi>
                and
              
              
              
              I pray God, they may never come to be <hi>active</hi>
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
              A third Charge, are the differing
                practices
                among us in several Churches,
                which, though we all joyn
                in the same Communion, yet, it seems,
                proves
                us to be Schismatick;
                <hi>That some only, are for bidding
                Prayer in the Pulpit, others use Prayer there, 93. Some
                pray in their own Words,
                and some in the words
                of the Liturgy,
                some use the same words,
                and others vary them.</hi>
                94. Now, is
                not this an
                admirable
                way of proving
                men
                Schismaticks?
                if there be one certain Rule for this, some of these
                men
                break that Rule, and are lyable
                to the Censures
                of their Superiours,
                but certainly,
                they are not Schismaticks,
                who own the Authority, and submit to the Discipline, and
                live in Communion with the Church. But, <hi>one
                is
                for Altars
                and Rails,
                and others against them,
                and others for Indifferency 98.</hi> And
                is
                this made
                a term of Communion
                or any part of Conformity, or determined
                either way by the Church? But, <hi>in
                preaching,
                they use very different Methods;</hi>
                somewhat better I confess, than are
                generally
                used
                in Conventicles;
                but does
                the Church confine us to any one? Or, may we not take that
                Liberty,
              
              
              which the Church gives?
                <hi>And, some Churches
                of them
                begin to use new versions
                of the singing
                Psalms.
                99.</hi> This is
                an
                Inadvertency
                or Mistake (to use a civil Parenthesis for once) and a
                sign, how little they frequent our
                Churches,
                or how little they mind what is
                done
                there: for he cannot name any one Church, which
                does
                so, unless he will call the private
                Chappel
                of the <hi>Charter-house,</hi> a Church: but however,
                singing
                Psalms
                it self, is
                no part of the prescribed
                Conformity,
                but only the connivance of Authority. But what a happy
                case are those men
                in, who can preach and pray as they list, and sing what
                Psalms
                they please, without danger of Schism? if such little
                things
                as these can make a Schismatick,
                it is
                strange to me, that Separation it self should be no
                Schism.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, <hi>Their Cathedral Worship much
                differeth
                from the Parochial, and some Churches
                use Organs,
                and others have none. 95.</hi> Wherein
                does
                this Difference consist? Have the Cathedral
                Churches,
                another Liturgy, than is
                used
                in Parochial Churches?
                Is
                there any other difference than
                is
                allowed
                of? May not the reading
                Psalms
                be either said
                or sung?
                Does
                not the Rubrick
                take notice of the Cathedral
              
              
              
              Hymns,
                and appoint, when they shall be
                sung?
                Is
                it a different Service,
                if the Litany be read in the Desk or in the Body of the
                Quire, and the Communion Service, at the Altar? And when
                the singing
                <hi>English</hi> Psalms
                in meeter,
                is
                only connived
                at, not enjoyned,
                does
                it make a schismatical Difference, to sing with
                Organs,
                or without? How vastly
                do these men
                differ from themselves!
                If the Church commands
                any <hi>indifferent Usages</hi>
                in religious Worship, it is
                so great a Violation of Christian Liberty, that it
                justifies
                their Separation:
                but on the other hand, if she leave any thing at Liberty,
                and men
                use that Liberty which is
                given
                them,
                it is
                so great a Disorder, that it makes
                those Schismaticks,
                who live like Brethren in the same Communion.

              Fourthly,
                another great Charge against
                these <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi>
                are those <hi>Church Impositions,</hi>
                which are so heavy and intolerable a burden to
                tender
                Consciences,
                and force those who desire Peace and Unity, to be at least
                <hi>meer
                Non-conformists;</hi>
                and if this Separation
                be a Schism, those are guilty of the Schism, who cause the
                Separation, not those who separate: to this purpose,
              
              
              he heaps
                together a great many things
                required
                in Conformity, and some not required,
                which make up the greatest
                part of those hundred and four Particulars,
                which yet remain to be considered;
                where we find things
                so unfairly
                represented,
                with such spiteful and disingenuous
                Insinuations
                against our Governours
                and Government, that it is
                too plain a Proof, how inconsistent a rash, furious Zeal
                is
                with moral Honesty;
                as to take notice of some few things
                very briefly.

              <hi>N.</hi> 25. he says,
                <hi>The Convocation cast away the King's Declaration, and
                drew
                up the Changes
                in the Liturgy, which added
                to our Burden.</hi> This was
                very boldly
                done,
                if it were
                true, and I wonder the King was
                never heard
                to complain of the Affront: but, I find this
                Declaration
                serves
                all Purposes;
                when they have a mind to libell
                the King, then he flung
                away his Declaration himself, and
                is
                not to be trusted
                any more; but when they would make the Church
                schismatical, then the <hi>Convocation cast it away,</hi>
                and not only so, <hi>but they drew
                the Parliament to confirm it all:</hi> And, what a wise
                People were
                they, who choose such a Parliament, as would be thus
              
              
              
              wheadled
                by a Convocation? but, the Truth
                is,
                that Parliament had
                a fresh Sense of the miseries
                of our late Confusions,
                and the wild and ungovernable Temper of Fanaticism, which
                made
                them
                think it necessary, to restore and
                establish
                the Loyal and Suffering
                Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p><hi>N.</hi> 26. As for their next Grievance, the
              <hi>Corporation Oath,</hi> that
              does
              not concern the Church, but the Security of the State; and
              it is
              extreamly
              modest in these men,
              to quarrel at a Prince, whose Father
              was
              murdered,
              and he himself banished,
              by vertue
              of a solemn League and Covenant, that he will not admit such
              persons
              into Offices
              of Trust, who will not renounce it:
              especially,
              this was
              an
              unseasonable Objection at this time of day, when he
              sees,
              that his tender conscienced
              Dissenters,
              have learned
              the Knack of expounding
              such Oaths,
              and taking
              them,
              to serve some Turn, they best know what:
              especially,
              considering,
              that as sacred as they now think the Covenant, time
              was,
              when the Engagement laid
              it aside.</p>
            <p>
              His next Objections,
                or whatever he will call them,
                concern the <hi>Cross in Baptism,
                27. God-fathers
                and God-mothers,</hi>

                by Episcopal Imposition of hands,</hi>
                30. I hear nothing now of that good old Objection, the
                symbolical Ceremony
                of a Marriage-ring, for there are none of
                them
                so scrupulous, but they can digest
                hearing
                the Common-Prayer, and twenty Ceremonies,
                rather than not be married;
                especially,
                when there is
                a good Estate, which cannot be made
                sure in Law, without it; and could they not be
                legally
                married,
                till they were
                confirmed
                by the Bishop, and had
                received
                the Sacrament kneeling,
                and engaged
                to baptize
                their Children
                with the Sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and with
                God-fathers
                and God-mothers,
                the Dispute were
                at an
                end. We can remember, since no man, who
                had
                a good gainful Office, scrup'led
                receiving
                the Lord's Supper kneeling;
                and, methinks
                after all their Pretences
                of Doubts
                and Scruples,
                that is
                a very odd kind of tender Conscience, which will venture
                to be damned,
                to get, or to save an
                Estate, but is
                extreamly
                fearful and timorous, when any thing
                is
                to be done
                for the Peace and Unity, and good
                Government
                of the Church.

            <p>
              Another great Quarrel he has,
                is
                against those
                Canons,
                which excommunicate
                them,
                who reproach the established
                Church and Worship, or the thirty nine
                Articles,
                or the Rites
                and Ceremonies
                of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as superstitious, or
                condemn the Form of making
                and consecrating
                Bishops,
                Priests,
                and Deacons,
                as repugnant to the Word of God: <hi>N.</hi> 32, 33, 34,
                35, 36. And what is
                the fault of these Canons?
                Is
                it not fit for every Church to secure her Government,
                Doctrine, Worship, from the Lashes
                of every petulant Tongue? if they do not like these
                things,
                yet cannot
                they forbear to reproach and vilifie
                them?
                Is
                this part of that Liberty of Conscience they desire, to
                burlesque the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and expose it to
                Contempt? Yes. This is
                what they perpetually
                do, and are angry at the Church, that she will not give
                them
                Leave to do it; for, should they only
                modestly
                dissent, and not reproach the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                the People would see no Hurt in those
                things
                they quarrel at, and then farewel
                to Conventicles
                and Fanaticism. But, we must never expect to see Church or
                State, or the Reputation of the most innocent and
              
              
              virtuous men,
                secure, till there be a severe Restraint
                laid
                upon mens Tongues
                and Pens.

              <hi>N.</hi> 64. He says,
                <hi>They excommunicate all Ministers,
                that voluntarily
                relinquish their Calling,
                and use themselves as Laymen,
                and yet thousands
                must do both, if the Bishops
                silence them.</hi>
                And, is
                there no Difference between deserting
                an
                Office, and
                being
                deposed
                by Authority? Between a Servant's
                running
                away from his Master, and being
                turned
                out of Doors
                for his ill Manners,
                Disobedience, and ungovernable Temper? If Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                does
                not understand this Difference, I hope others will see,
                what value they are to have for his
                Judgment;
                and, least he should want Objections,
                he looks
                back to those times,
                which he will not allow us to think on, <hi>The new
                Canons,
                and Et-Caetera Oath in 1640. brought
                in without the Parliament,</hi> which
                is
                all the Objections
                he makes
                against them,
                though that be a popular Cheat; for,
                had
                they been
                brought
                in with the Parliament, he would have
                liked
                them
                never the better, nor excused
                the Church ever the more; for then, as we
                heard
                above, it had
                been
                as great a fault to <hi>draw in the Parliament to confirm
                them
              
              
              
              all,</hi> as to bring them

              Thus all the Silencings
                and Prosecutions
                of Protestant Dissenters
                in Q. <hi>El.</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>'s

                is
                a good Argument to this day. 396. 8. 69. To what purpose
                is
                all this? Do these things,
                which were
                done
                in former
                Ages,
                but are not done
                now, make us Schismaticks,
                or justifie
                their Separation?
                Then he reckons
                up a great many
                particular things,
                which are imposed
                on those who will conform; and that he may not want
                numbers,
                he brings
                over again the Cross in Baptism, and

                at the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
                imposed

                without which, they must neither

                of his Honesty, and how impossible it
                is,
                for such men
                to want Arguments,
                he is
                guilty of such a Falsification, as, if it be
                an
                ignorant mistake,
                ought to make him
                less confident another time; if it be
                willful,
                should teach other men
                to be less confident of him:
                his Words
                are these, <hi>They must profess Consent and Practise to
                pronounce all that they bury to be
                TAKEN
                TO GOD

                Now, if there be any such words
                in the Office of Burial, as <hi>taken
                to God in Mercy, where we hope to come,</hi> I will yield
                the Cause; but the Fraud is
                this, he has
                taken
                the first part of the Sentence from the
                words
                that are pronounced
                at the interring
                the Corps,
                and has
                made
                up the other part, not of the words
                (tho he has
                put them
                into the <hi>Italick</hi>
                Character,
                as the words
                of the Common-Prayer) but from the Sense of
                an
                Expression
                in the Collect after the Burial, and
                has
                joyned
                them
                together, as if they were
                one entire Sentence in the Common-Prayer,
                and made
                one entire Sense: whereas, these
                words
                which he has
                thus tacked
                together, have a very different
                Sense and Interpretation, as appears
                from the different manner of speaking
                used
                in each. In the first part, the Church
                is
                very positive, <hi>It has
                pleased
                Almighty God, of his great Mercy, to take unto himself,
                the Soul of our dear Brother here
                departed;</hi>
                But, in the Collect, it is
                only matter of Hope, and the Judgment
                of Charity, <hi>That when we depart
              
              
              
              this Life, we may rest in him,
                as our Hope is,
                this our Brother doth.</hi> Now, if our Church mean the
                same thing, by <hi>God's taking
                to himself the Soul of our dear
                Brother in
                great Mercy,</hi> and <hi>our resting
                in him;</hi>
                Why does
                she in one place peremptorily
                assert it, without any doubt and hesitancy, and in the
                other place, express only some hope of it? But, I find Mr.
                <hi>B.</hi> is
                still to learn the Difference
                between <hi>God's taking
                our Souls
                to himself in great Mercy,</hi> and
                taking
                them
                <hi>to his Mercy:</hi> The first
                signifies
                no more, than that God takes
                them
                to his own Tribunal, to be judged
                by himself, and not to leave them
                to the unjust Judgments
                of men
                or Devils:
                which we must acknowledge to be great Mercy, to stand
                before a just, and equal, and most merciful Tribunal,
                where all the unjust Sentences,
                which men
                pass against one another, shall be
                reversed,
                and their Cause heard
                over again. But, to take any man to his Mercy,
                is
                to absolve, acquit, and reward him,
                so that we are not bound
                to assent, that Atheists
                and profane men
                go to Heaven, but to hope charitably
                of those, who live and die in the Communion of the Church;
                and if for want of the due Exercise of
                Discipline,
              
              
              any bad men
                die in Church-Communion, some men
                do not think themselves bound
                to use those words;
                which suppose the Exercise of Discipline.
                However, these are different degrees
                of Hope, and though we can have very little hope of some
                Persons,
                yet, unless we are absolutely
                sure, that they died
                final Impenitents,
                which, in most Cases,
                is
                impossible for us to know, we are not without all hope of
                very bad men:
                at least, we may have as much hope of
                them,
                as of Self-murderers,
                of whom
                I remember Mr. <hi>B.</hi> somewhere
                speaks
                with great Favour, though they die in the
                willful
                Commission of the most barbarous and unnatural Sin,
                without
                Repentance.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this, at best, sounds
                ill at the Funerals
                of bad men,
                to say, that God hath,
                in great Mercy, taken
                to himself, their Souls,
                when we know, that according
                to the Terms
                of the Gospel, they must be condemned
                to endless Punishments;
                we must consider, that there is
                Mercy, even in Judgment,
                and if we believe, that there are different
                degrees
                of Punishment
                in the other World, proportioned
                to the Nature of mens Sins,
                and that God our Judge, will make all
                favourable
              
              
              
              Allowances,
                which any man's case will bear; we must acknowledge it
                an
                act of Mercy, for God to judge us himself, and not to
                leave us to the Will of evil and merciless
                Spirits:
                as when <hi>David</hi> was
                put to that hard Choice, <hi>Shall seven
                years
                of Famine come unto thee
                in thy Land? Or wilt
                thou flie
                three Months
                before thy Enemies,
                while they pursue
                thee?
                Or, that there be three days
                Pestilence
                in thy Land? David</hi> answers,
                <hi>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord (for his
                Mercies
                are great) and let me not fall into the hand of man. 2
                Sam.</hi> 24. 13. 14. And if the Mercy of God, even when
                he punishes
                so severely,
                be a just Reason
                to choose to fall into the hand, the immediate disposal of
                God, rather than into the hands
                of men,
                then we have Reason to bless God, that he will be our
                Judge, and not leave us to the Will and Lust of cruel and
                implacable Spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <hi>Non-conformists
                Advocate,</hi> in Answer
              
              to this, seems
                to deny a great Article
                of our Faith, that Christ is
                the Judge of the Quick and of the Dead, of good and bad
                men;
                that because the Devil takes
                such men
                Captive, while they live, therefore he
                is
                their Judge
              
              
              after Death too. <hi>That the Devil
                had,
                and has
                still, the Power of Death, in respect
                of all impenitent Sinners,
                as the Carnifex
                or Executioner, has
                Power over all those who are condemned
                to die:</hi> But what before they are
                condemned
                man? Then he is
                judge too, as well as Executioner: but, if as he
                adds,
                <hi>They be put into his hands,
                that the Sentence may be actually
                fulfilled,</hi>
                then it seems,
                the Sentence is
                past before they are put into the Devil's hand, and that
                is
                as much as we desire; that not the Devil, but God, may
                have the passing
                of the Sentence, and the Devil
                have no Power to execute any other Sentence, than what God
                passes;
                and yet he knows
                not how to believe, <hi>That abominable wicked
                Workers
                go immediately</hi>
              
              <hi>after Death into the hands
                of the great God to be disposed
                of by him
                according
                to the promises
                of the Gospel-Covenant.</hi> But, he might, and must
                believe this, if he added
                <hi>Conditions</hi>
                too, as he ought to have done,
                if he intended
                to represent the Sense either of Dr. <hi>Faulkner,</hi> or
                his Transcriber, as he is
                pleased
                to call him;
                or else he must deny that bad men
                shall be judged
                by the Gospel, or that Christ is
                the Judge of bad men.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>But let this Expression of <hi>God's
              taking
              the Souls
              of bad men
              in Mercy to himself,</hi>
              be never so hard (tho our Church never
              intended
              it should be applied
              to notorious bad men)
              yet, certainly
              it is
              much harder,
              to affix such a Sense upon it, as
              is
              directly
              contrary to the declared
              and avowed
              Doctrine of the Church. If he can find, that the Church of
              <hi>England,</hi>
              in her Articles
              or Homilies,
              gives
              Encouragement to notorious bad men
              without Repentance to expect Mercy from God, he may then,
              without breach of Charity, expound her
              Prayers
              to this Sense: but if she teaches
              quite the contrary,
              we cannot think, that she has
              one Rule of Doctrine in the profession of her Faith, another
              for the exercise of her Devotions.</p>
            <p>
              The Truth is,
                this Office of Burial is
                an
                excellent Office, supposing
                the due exercise of Church Discipline, to cast all
                notorious Sinners
                and Schismaticks,
                out of the Communion of the Church: which the Church
                supposes
                to be done,
                when she commands
                us to use this form of Words,
                and enjoyns,
                that <hi>then the Preist
                shall say,</hi> &amp;c. as this Advocate
                objects.
              
              And thus we subscribe it, as a proper Office for the
                Burial of all Christians,
              
              
              who are fit to live in the Communion
                of the Church; the want of this case in
                exercising
                Discipline, raises
                some Scruples,
                as to Practice, when these words
                are applied
                to bad men,
                who, though they died
                in the Communion of the Church, yet
                did
                not deserve to do so: and, I wish with all my Heart, that
                some Expressions
                were
                altered,
                to prevent
                any Scandal to the scrupulous, or to the
                prophane,
                or, which is
                more desireable,
                that Discipline were
                revived,
                which would soon answer all these
                Objections.
            </p>
            <p>But, yet there is
              one thing more to be said
              in this matter, which though it be not
              ordinarily
              taken
              notice of, seems
              to me to be of great Moment, and
              justifies
              what I before said
              concerning
              that Liberty, which every Minister may take in
              omitting
              such Passages,
              as our Dissenters
              except against in the Burial of
              Papists,
              Schismaticks,
              or incorrigible Sinners.</p>
            <p>
              By the Rubrick
                excommunicate persons
                are excepted
                from Christian Burial; now, there are two
                sorts
                of Excommunications
                allowed
                in our Church, <hi>Excommunicatio
                sub judice,</hi> and <hi>latae Sententiae;</hi>
                The first is,
                when men
                are formally
              
              
              
              excommunicated
                by the Ecclesiastical Judge; the second
                is
                that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so often
                talks
                of, the Excommunication
                <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> when, by the
                Canons
                of the Church, a man who is
                guilty of such Offences
                as are there specified,
                is
                declared
                to be Excommunicate,
                before any judicial Sentence passes
                on him.
                Now, the Rubrick,
                which forbids
                the Burial of excommunicated
                persons,
                does
                not confine this to any one sort of Excommunication: and
                therefore if a Minister, either in
                visiting
                the Sick, or by any other means,
                finds
                any man under this Sentence, though not
                actually
                inflicted
                on him
                by an
                Ecclesiastical
                Judge, yet he may, by vertue
                of this Rubrick,
                refuse to bury him
                by that Form prescribed
                in our Liturgy, because, by the
                Canons
                of the Church, he is
                under the Sentence of Excommunication.
                This Authority is
                expressly
                allowed
                the Minister, in repelling
                those from the Communion of the <hi>Lord's
                Supper,</hi>
                who are <hi>notorious and open evil
                Livers;</hi>
                and the same Reason holds
                in the Office of Burial, but this I submit to the
                Judgment
                of my Superiours.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, to proceed, <hi>N.</hi> 53. They <hi>must declare
                Assent to a false Rule for finding
              
              
              Easter-day, and consent to keep two
                Easters,
                often, yea, though it be confessed
                false.</hi> Some Learned
                men
                are not so confident, that Rule
                is
                <hi>false,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                seems
                to be; to be sure it does
                not often fail, as he insinuates;
                and others think that we do not give our <hi>Assent</hi>
                and <hi>Consent</hi> to it, because we are not
                confined
                to the Use of it, the <hi>Church</hi>
                having
                given
                another Rule which never fails;
                and we may use which we please. The thing to be
                done
                is,
                to find out <hi>Easter-day;</hi> and if we have a certain
                Rule for that, which is
                <hi>alwayes
                true,</hi> and another which is
                so <hi>generally
                true,</hi> that if there be any Defect in it, it
                was
                not discovered
                till of late dayes,
                that is
                a mighty squeamish Conscience
                that strains
                at such Gnats
                as these; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> shall have the glory of
                making
                a second <hi>Paschal Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi>
                upon much more trifling
                Reasons,
                than occasioned
                the first. We do not give our Assent to every
                Saying
                in the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> but to every thing
                which is
                <hi>contained
                in, and prescribed
                by it,</hi> that is,
                what we are bound
                to use, and there being
                two Rules
                given
                for the finding
                <hi>Easter,</hi> without confining
                us to the Use of either, we may use which we will, and so
                are not bound
                to
              
              
              
              use that which happens
                to be <hi>false,</hi> but that which
                is
                <hi>true.</hi> But, to <hi>assent,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                does,
                if there be any Force in this <hi>Exception,</hi> that we
                are bound
                to use them
                both, and hence conclude, that we give our consent to keep
                two <hi>Easters</hi>
                often, when the Church's Design in both their
                Rules,
                is,
                to find out but one <hi>Easter,</hi> (or else neither of
                the Rules
                can ever be false) is
                an
                Argument of great Ingenuity, and great Modesty, and a very
                <hi>peaceable Design:</hi> and yet, if this be the worst
                of it, I would rather keep ten <hi>Easters</hi>
                every year, than be a <hi>Schismatick;</hi>
                unless the Church should command me to believe, that
                Christ, who <hi>rose</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> but
                <hi>once,</hi> rose on two or three several
                dayes:
                and there is
                no danger of this, for we do not observe <hi>Easter,</hi>
                as the precise time of Christ's <hi>Resurrection,</hi> no
                more than the <hi>Jews</hi>
                did
                the Feast of the <hi>Passeover.</hi>
                And now I think of it, I can tell Mr. <hi>B.</hi> a more
                material Objection than this, from the difference of the
                <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Stile,</hi> by which
                means,
                all the Churches,
                which follow the <hi>New Stile,</hi> as <hi>Holland,
                France, Spain, Italy, &amp;c.</hi>
                Protestants
                as well as Papists,
                observe <hi>Easter</hi> ten dayes
                before our <hi>English Easter,</hi> and many
                Merchants,
                who
              
              
              have come out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>
                after their <hi>Easter,</hi> have come time enough into
                <hi>England,</hi> to be guilty of that horrid Sin of
                keeping
                two <hi>Easters</hi>
                in a year: if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will but set his
                Wits
                to work about this, he may improve it into as notable a
                Controversie,
                as that of old was
                of the <hi>Quarto-Decimani,</hi> and then let
                him
                alone to turn it into a <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              <hi>N.</hi> 55. He endeavours
                to put new Scruples
                into Peoples
                heads,
                about that Declaration, <hi>That it
                is
                not lawful, on any pretence whatsoever, to take
                Arms
                against those commissionated
                by the King.</hi> These are <hi>his</hi>
                words,
                for there is
                no such Sentence
                in the Declaration which is
                printed
                in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Uniformity,</hi> the
                words
                of which are these; <hi>It is
                not lawful, upon
                any pretence whatsoever, to take
                Arms
                against the King; and that I do
                abhorr
                that traiterous
                Position of taking
                Arms
                by his Authority against his Person, or against those that
                are commissionated
                by him.</hi>
                There seems
                to be some difference between
                Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s words,
                and the words
                of the Declaration; for it is
                <hi>unlawful</hi> to take Arms,
                upon any pretence, against the King, but the
                <hi>Declaration</hi> does
                not say, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does,
                <hi>that it is
                unlawful, upon any Pretence, to take
                Arms
                against
              
              
              
              those commissionated
                by the King:</hi> If their Commission be legal and good,
                it is
                then as unlawful to resist them,
                as to resist the King; but if, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                puts
                the case, their Commission be <hi>illegal, fraudulent,
                extorted</hi>
                from him,
                these are reasonable and just <hi>pretences,</hi>
                when they are cercertainly
                known,
                to resist such men,
                though it is
                never lawful to take Arms
                against the King: and therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                did
                not do well (for I will at present say no worse of it) to
                apply those exclusive
                terms,
                (on which his whole Objection
                is
                founded)
                <hi>upon any pretence whatsoever,</hi> to those
                <hi>commissionated
                by the King,</hi> which the Declaration
                applies
                only <hi>to the King himself.</hi> And,
                methinks,
                it was
                not wisely
                done
                neither, when the Brethren had
                set out their Explication of such kind of
                Declarations,
                and were
                in a hopeful way of getting
                the Power of
                all Corporations
                into their hands,
                which would be greatly
                serviceable to the Cause, to furbish up some old,
                outworn
                Objections,
                to trouble their Consciences,
                which may deprive us of godly &amp;
                well-affected
                Magistrates
                for ever after.
            </p>
            <p>
              <hi>N.</hi> 56. Another great Grievance
                is,
                <hi>that none must preach that subscribeth
                not, that (there lieth
                no obligation from the
              
              
              Oath called
                the Covenant, on him,
                or any other Person, to endeavour any Change or Alteration
                of Church-Government) though many hundred
                thousands
                took
                that Oath whom
                we know not, nor their sense.</hi> What then?
                Truly,
                I can't tell where the Force of this Objection
                lies,
                unless it be in this, that we cannot say, <hi>that no man
                is
                obliged,
                by the Covenant, unless we knew
                his sense, whether he thinks
                himself obliged
                or not:</hi> as if there were
                no difference between the obligation of
                an
                Oath, in it self considered,
                and that obligation which a mistaken
                Opinion and erroneous
                Conscience layes
                upon men?
                as if the Parliament commanded
                us to declare
                what mens Thoughts
                and secret Judgments
                are, not what they ought to be,
                considering
                the Intrinsick
                nature and obligation of such an
                Oath? as if I could not say, that there lay no
                obligation
                upon <hi>Herod</hi> to cut off <hi>John</hi> the
                <hi>Baptist</hi>'s
                head, because, it seems,
                he thought there was?
                But he adds,
                <hi>and so all Reformation
                of Church-Government is
                made
                unlawful and impossible, though
                vowed.</hi>
                I beseech you Sir, is
                there no difference between the Change and Alteration of
                the Government of the Church by
                Arch-bishops,
                Bishops,
                <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was
              
              
              
              the Matter of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the
                Reformation
                of any Defects
                in the Diseipline
                or Government of the Church? Is
                there no difference between pulling
                up the Foundation of a House, and
                making
                some such Alterations
                in particular Rooms
                and Offices,
                as may be for the greater
                Ornament and Use? Was
                there no obligation to reform the Church
                before the
                <hi>Solemn League and Covenant?</hi> and do not the same
                Obligations
                continue,
                though the Covenant be taken
                away? How then does
                the renouncing
                an
                <hi>illegal Covenant</hi> to pull down the
                <hi>Church,</hi> make it <hi>unlawful</hi> and
                <hi>impossible</hi> to reform it?
            </p>
            <p><hi>N.</hi> 66. He complains,
              that <hi>the Parish Priest</hi> (a name which we are not
              ashamed
              of, though often spoken
              in derision and scorn by him)
              <hi>must publish Excommuncations,
              though against his Conscience, against godly
              men,
              for not conforming.</hi>
              I suppose he speaks
              of some <hi>passive Conformists,</hi>
              for the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers</hi>
              don't use to act against their Consciences,
              nor make any scruple of excommunicating
              <hi>godly Schismaticks,</hi>
              who first excommunicate
              themselves.</p>
            <p>
              <hi>N.</hi> 63. <hi>Ordination enableth
                no man to preach, without farther License.</hi> And thus
              
              
              it was
                in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> where no
                <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                were
                allowed
                to preach, or administer the Eucharist in the
                Bishop's
                presence, nor in his absence, without
                his leave and Licence. Our <hi>Ordination</hi>
                (as appears
                in the Form of Ordination)
                gives
                us Authority to preach, which is
                a general Qualification; the Bishop's Licence
                determines
                the Exercise
                of our Ministry to a certain place; and these are two
                different things,
                as those know, who are skilled
                in the Ancient
                Practice of the Church.
            </p>
            <p>These are the principal <hi>Impositions</hi>
              he complains
              of, which make them
              <hi>Separatists,</hi>
              and the Church and Church-men
              <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>
              He mentions
              some others, without giving
              the least insinuation, what fault he
              finds
              with them,
              and, of all men
              I know, I will not undertake to guess at Mr. <hi>B's</hi>
              Reasons.</p>
            <p>
              And therefore, to bring this matter, about
                <hi>Impositions,</hi>
                to a short issue: <hi>Impositions</hi>
                signifie
                no more than those terms
                of <hi>Communion,</hi> which are
                enjoyned
                and commanded
                to be observed
                by all the Members
                of our Church; and if it be <hi>unlawful</hi> in it self
                to make any Laws
                and Rules
                of <hi>Communion,</hi> and to command the Observation of
                them;
                then either
              
              
              
              there must be no <hi>Church-Society,</hi> or
                every
              
              Church must be <hi>Schismatical,</hi> who
                refuses
                such Members
                as will not submit to its
                peculiar Laws
                and Rules;
                and then all the Churches,
                that I know of, are so: the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who
                require all men
                to submit to their mixt
                Tribunal of their Ministers
                and Lay-Elders;
                the <hi>Independent,</hi> who require
                an
                explicit <hi>Church-Covenant;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
                himself
                was
                a very great <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                not only in
                exacting
                Conformity to that Discipline
                which he set up in <hi>Geneva,</hi> but in
                exhorting
                the Lord Protector, in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, to
                impose Articles
                of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a Form of
                <hi>Catechising,</hi>
                and a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> upon all the
                Bishops
                and Ministers
                of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which it should
                not be lawful for them
                to recede
                (nay, which, as far as concerns
                matter of
                Doctrine) they should be bound,
                by an
                express Oath, to observe; and no man should be capable of
                any Ecclesiastical
                Office, who refused
                it.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>And, if it be not unlawful for our
              Superiours
              to impose certain Terms
              of Communion, it is
              not enough to discover
              a <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
              to say that he is
              an
              <hi>Imposer,</hi>
              or to reckon up his several <hi>Impositions,</hi>
              without proving
              the sinfulness of them;
              but, I doubt not, but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will rather
              chuse
              to state Cases,
              than undertake
              such a Task.</p>
            <p>
              And therefore to proceed, Fifthly,
                He taxes
                several <hi>Imperfections</hi>
                and <hi>Abuses,</hi>
                which are accidental to the best
                constituted
                Government, and some of which, we would be as glad to see
                mended
                as he: only the difference between us
                is,
                that we do not think it the best way of
                remedying
                <hi>abuses,</hi>
                to pull down the <hi>Church,</hi> when we know not how to
                set up a better in the room of it. Under this Head, may be
                reduced
                <hi>N.</hi> 40. where he complains
                of the <hi>too great extent of Parishes,
                where many thousand Parishioners
                cannot be received
                in their Parish Church;</hi> But the Parliament must
                reform this,
                not the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi>
                who can neither make Parishes
                less nor bigger
                than they are. But why this should be thought a good
                reason to suffer
                Non-conformists
                to draw them
                from the Church, I cannot tell. It
                is
                highly
              
              
              
              necessary and desireable,
                that all Persons
                may have convenient opportunities
                of publick
                <hi>Worship,</hi> and publick
                <hi>Instructions</hi>
                in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church: but, upon this
                pretence, to suffer <hi>Dissenters</hi>
                to poyson
                our People with Schismatical
                Principles,
                and to reproach and vilifie
                our <hi>publick
                Worship,</hi> and undermine
                the <hi>established
                Religion,</hi> is
                neither <hi>reasonable</hi> nor <hi>prudent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              And indeed, this is
                a <hi>meer
                pretence</hi> to justifie
                their Separation; for there was
                great occasion for these Clamors
                in the late Times,
                when we heard
                nothing of them,
                and yet the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
                did
                not think this a sufficient reason to suffer
                <hi>Independents,
                Quakers,
                Anabaptists,</hi>
                to keep Conventicles
                in their Parishes,
                for fear People should, <hi>like
                Savages,
                forbear all publick
                Learning
                and Worship of God:</hi> They usually
                keep their Conventicles
                in such places,
                where there is
                least need of their help, where there are
                Churches
                enough to <hi>receive,</hi> and
                Ministers,
                of sufficient
                Abilities,
                to <hi>instruct</hi> their People: and, if there do want
                more Assistance in some Parishes,
                thanks
                be to God, we need not go to <hi>Dissenters</hi>
                for it. This, certainly,
                can be no reason of their Nonconformity,
                for they might do more
              
              
              Service this way by Conforming;
                and, if it be the true reason of their
                preaching,
                let them
                but tell People so, that they do not desire to draw
                them
                from Communion with the Church of
                <hi>England,</hi>
                but only to supply the want of Churches,
                where the Parishes
                are too large, and I shall, for my part, entertain more
                favourable thoughts
                of them,
                than I have at present. But I abhorr
                Hypocrisie,
                and it is
                downright Hypocrisie
                for such men
                as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to pretend that a reason for their
                preaching
                in <hi>Schismatical
                Conventicles,</hi>
                which is
                not the reason
                why they do it, (as appears
                from their doing
                it, where this reason cannot be
                pretended)
                but only a Popular Excuse
                for doing
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, <hi>N.</hi> 41. he sayes,
                <hi>They swear the Church-wardens
                to present all that come not to Church, and punish
                them
                for not coming,
                when some Parishes
                have 40000, some 30000, some 10000, that can have no room,
                and the Church-wardens
                cannot know them.</hi>
                Now, supposing
                all this to be true, it is
                great pity it should be so; but how
                does
                this prove the <hi>Diocesan Canoneer</hi>
                to be a Schismatick?
                and, as for the Church-wardens,
                they are not sworn
                to do that which is
                impossible, but to
              
              
              
              discharge their Office according
                to the best of their skill and knowledge; and yet, if they
                have a mind to it, those who are so well
                acquainted
                with the Parish,
                as all men
                are supposed
                to be, before
                they come to be Church-wardens,
                especially
                in such large Parishes,
                they may have some competent knowledge, who neglect the
                Church out of Irreligion
                and Prophaneness,
                and who, out of Schismatical Principles:
                and indeed, though the Parishes
                be never so large, there are none, who have a mind to come
                to Church, but may find some opportunities,
                in a years
                time, to get room in it, and hold <hi>occasional
                Communion,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                calls
                it, with other Parochial Churches,
                when they can't.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, <hi>N.</hi> 42. he tells
                us, <hi>That if they go to other
                Parishes
                oft for Communion, they must not be
                admitted,
                but forbidden,
                and sent
                Home.</hi> Here we have another
                Tast
                of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s sincere Dealing;
                he had
                been
                complaining
                of the vast numbers
                of Inhabitants
                in many Parishes,
                who could not have room in the Church, which
                made
                it necessary for <hi>them
                to hear and joyn
                with Non-conformists,</hi>
                unless, <hi>like Savages,
                they forbear all publick
                Learning,
                and Worship of God.</hi> And, to
                prevent
              
              
              that obvious Objection, that they may better go to other
                Parish Churches
                than to Conventicles,
                he adds
                here, that <hi>if they go to other
                Parishes
                oft for Communion,
                they must be forbidden,
                and sent
                home:</hi> by which it is
                plain, he designed
                his Readers
                should understand, that they might not,
                according
                to the Orders
                of our Church, go to other Parish
                Churches,
                to hear Prayers
                or Sermon, when there is
                no Room in their own: for otherwise, his <hi>yet if they
                go,</hi> which joyns
                this Saying
                with what went
                before,
                makes
                it Non-sense, or Sophistry, if he
                does
                not speak of the same thing. But, for fear any man should
                discover the Cheat, he alters
                his Word, and calls
                it <hi>Communion,</hi> which has
                a large Signification,
                and may signifie
                either Communion
                in Prayers
                and Preaching,
                or in Sacraments;
                for so the 28 <hi>Canon,</hi> to which, I suppose, he
                refers,
                respects
                only the
                <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which every man
                is
                required
                to receive at his own Church, among his
                Neighbours;
                that their own Ministers
                may have satisfaction that they do receive it, but they
                are not commanded
                to turn such Strangers
                out of the Church, when they come to hear
                Prayers,
                or Sermons.
                The Canons
                considered
              
              
              
              only ordinary Cases;
                and, when we remember, that it is
                but of late years,
                that the Buildings
                in Out-Parishes
                have so vastly
                increased,
                we may reasonably
                suppose, that 40 years
                ago, when these Canons
                were
                made,
                though some Parishes
                were
                too large, yet, the disproportion
                of numbers,
                above what the Parish Churches
                can receive, was
                not near (I may say, not near half) so great: and there
                never was
                any Church or Nation, that thought their
                Laws
                and Canons
                so Sacred, as to make no allowance
                for Cases
                of Necessity. And yet we may observe, that there
                is
                not the same reason for giving
                People leave to receive
                the Sacrament at others Churches,
                as there is
                to frequent Prayers
                and Sermons
                elsewhere, when there is
                no room for them
                in their own Church: for 40000 may, with more ease,
                receive the Sacrament, by the frequency of
                Communions
                in such large Parishes,
                than 10000 can joyn
                in Prayer and Sermons
                in one place.

            <p>
              <hi>N. 44. Though many melancholy
                Persons
                dare not communicate in the Sacraments,
                and many others are secretly
                conscious
                of Atheism, Infidelity, or Wickedness,
                they must be compelled
                to receive
              
              
              thrice a year.</hi> What purpose this
                serves,
                I know not, but it contains
                a very foolish
                and spightful
                insinuation. The case is
                this; The Canons
                require, that every professed
                Christian, should, at least, receive
                the <hi>Lord's Supper three times
                a year,</hi> and be liable to <hi>Church-censures,</hi>
                if they neglect so great and necessary a <hi>Duty.</hi>
                Is
                this a fault, for the Church to oblige her
                Children
                to observe every part of <hi>God's Worship?</hi> or
                is
                three times
                a year too often? It may be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may think so,
                who acknowledges,
                that he did
                not administer the Sacrament once in 18
                years.
                But, it may be, there are some <hi>melancholy
                Persons,
                who dare not communicate
                in the Sacraments,</hi>
                and they <hi>must be compelled
                to it.</hi> But how does
                that appear?
                They must be returned
                to the Bishop, who is
                the ordinary Judge of these Cases,
                who will not <hi>censure,</hi> where there
                is
                a favourable Excuse, but <hi>exhort,</hi> and
                <hi>persuade,</hi> and <hi>convince,</hi> and
                endeavour
                to cure that <hi>Superstitious Melancholy,</hi>
                which, when there is
                no other <hi>apparent cause,</hi>
                is
                either the effect of <hi>bodily
                distempers,</hi>
                or of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which
                has
                made
                some slight the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and others, dread
                it. But, <hi>others are secretly
                conscious of Atheism, Infidelity, or
              
              
              
              Wickedness,</hi> and they also <hi>must be
                compelled
                to receive:</hi> If this be <hi>secret,</hi> the
                Minister
                cannot take notice of it, but must require
                them
                to do their Duty, as they are <hi>profess'd
                Christians,</hi>
                or to give a reason
                why they don't; and then, if they think fit to confess,
                that they are <hi>Atheists,
                Infidels,</hi>
                or <hi>very wicked Persons,</hi>
                I will undertake, they shall not be
                <hi>compelled</hi>
                to receive, nor <hi>censured</hi>
                for not receiving,
                but for being
                <hi>Atheists,
                c.</hi> for, the Ministers
                are expresly
                commanded
                to keep such Persons,
                when they are known,
                from the <hi>Communion,</hi> though Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                does
                fairly
                insinuate, that our Church forces
                the most wicked and profligate
                Wretches
                to <hi>communicate</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              <hi>N.</hi> 60. He complains
                again of the largeness of some Parishes,
                and, <hi>that other Parishes
                (too many) have Priests,
                that are raw, unskilful men,
                utterly
                unfit for such pastoral helps.</hi>
                There is
                nothing new in this, but the <hi>rawness</hi> and
                <hi>unskilfulness</hi> of some Parish-Priests,
                <hi>too many,</hi> he says;
                and this is
                true, if there be but two or three in all
                <hi>England,</hi> though it insinuates
                a great number of such men.
                But I will not take Mr. <hi>B's</hi> word for this, who, I
                believe, personally
                knows
                very
              
              
              few of them,
                and is
                none of the most favourable Judges
                to <hi>Conformists.</hi>
                That there are some, who are no
                Learned
                <hi>Rabbies,</hi>
                is
                no wonder, considering,
                how many small Vicaridges
                there are, which will not buy Bread for their
                Families,
                much less, furnish them
                with Books:
                though I am
                apt to think, there never was
                a more Learned
                Clergy in <hi>England</hi> than there
                is
                at this day; and some, whom
                he accounts
                <hi>raw and unskilful men,</hi>
                are able to discover his Sophistry, and despise all his
                Religious wheedles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <hi>N.</hi> 61. We have another cast of his Office. <hi>If
                a Parish have a Priest so drunken,
                that his own Family can scarce live with
                him,
                or so insufficient, that he never
                preaches,
                because he cannot, or will not, and People scruple
                encouraging
                such a one in his ill undertaking
                of the Ministry, and dare not take
                him
                for their Pastoral Guide, they are forbid to go from
                him,
                and communicate
                in the next Parish, and the Minister that
                receiveth
                them,
                or baptizeth their Children,
                though conformable, is
                suspended.</hi>
                For this he cites
                <hi>Canon</hi> 57. and, I confess,
                I am
                amazed
                to see such a man as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> print such
                palpable falshoods,
                as will not admit of a <hi>civil parenthesis.</hi> As for
                <hi>drunken
                Priests,</hi>
                there is
                not one
              
              
              
              word of them
                in the <hi>Canon,</hi> the whole Design of which
                is,
                to cure that Superstitious
                Conceit, that <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's
                Supper</hi> were
                not
              
              as efficacious, when administred
                by an
                un-preaching,
                as by a Preaching
                Minister, when the intire
                Doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
                and whatever is
                necessary
                to the administration of them,
                is
                contained
                in the <hi>publick
                Liturgy,</hi> and therefore may as
                effectually
                be administred
                by a Minister who does
                not preach, as by a Preacher; and therefore, whoever, for
                this reason, that is,
                out of this <hi>Superstitious
                Conceit,</hi> leave their Parish-Churches,
                and Baptize
                their Children,
                and receive
                the Lord's Supper, in other Parishes,
                shall be liable to <hi>Ecclesiastical
                Censures;</hi>
                and the Minister who <hi>confirms</hi>
                them
                in this <hi>superstitious persuasion,</hi> by
                baptizing
                their Children,
                and receiving
                them
                to Communion, shall be <hi>suspended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              How unlike is
                this to that account Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                has
                given,
                when the whole scope and reason of this <hi>Canon</hi>
                is,
                to cure People of that <hi>superstitious conceit,</hi>
                that <hi>the efficacy of the Sacrament
                depends
              
              
              upon the Administrator,</hi> which
                is
                a rank piece of <hi>Popery,</hi> and too much
                countenanced
                by <hi>Fanaticism;</hi> the People
                imagining,
                that the Holiness and great Abilities
                of their Preachers,
                does,
                at least, add some Vertue
                to the Sacraments,
                and their Preachers
                favouring
                this <hi>Superstition,</hi> to gain
                Proselytes,
                and to keep them
                fast; which is
                the reason why we find their Books
                so stuffed
                with Complements
                to themselves, of Holy, Learned,
                Pious, Faithful Pastors,
                when they cannot afford
                to speak truth of other men,
                nay, not to forbear unjust Calumnies
                and Reproaches.
                Indeed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
                some reason to be angry with this Canon, (and, I think, he
                has
                sufficiently
                revenged
                himself upon it) which seems
                to be levelled
                against those <hi>passive Conformist
                Preachers,</hi>
                who set up this Trade above forty
                years
                ago.

                of the manner of advancing
                men
                to Rectories
                and Bishopricks,
                that Bishops
                are now made
                without the consent of the People, which
                is
                contrary to the ancient Canons
                of the Church, which say, that <hi>he
                is
                no Bishop that had
                not the Peoples
                Election and Consent.</hi> I would
                willingly
                see these Antient
                Canons,
                for, I confess, I never
              
              
              
              met
                with them
                yet; the People never had
                an
                Original Right in the choice of their
                Bishops,
                for they are not the proper
                Judges
                of their Ministerial Abilities:
                but they might bear testimony of their
                manners,
                as being
                the witness of their Conversation, and so they may still
                if they please; and when they do so, let
                them
                complain if any <hi>bad man</hi> be
                ordained.
                Thus it was
                in the dayes
                of the Apostles,
                which is
                the only Primitive Antiquity Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will own,
                when he thinks
                it serves
                his turn: in after Ages,
                by degrees,
                the People pretended
                to something more in the Election of their
                Bishops,
                the inconveniency of which was
                found so great, that it was
                restrained
                by Antient
                <hi>Councils;</hi>
                and <hi>Canons</hi>
                were
                made
                for the Regulation of such Elections.
                And in some Churches
                this was
                never allowed,
                as particularly,
                at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                where the Bishop was
                chose
                by the twelve Presbyters,
                as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
                has
                largely
                proved;
                but the difference
              
              between these two great men
                (as Mr. <hi>B's</hi> late Encomiast
                insinuates)
                is,
                that one is
                a profound Notion-maker without Book, and the other
                proves
                what he sayes,
                out of his Books.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
              But then he sayes,
                <hi>they suppose that God hath
                intrusted
                the King to chuse
                for all his Subjects,
                whom
                they shall commit the conduct of their
                Souls
                to, as their Pastors
                and Bishops.</hi>
                And indeed, all Religious
                Kings
                have thought themselves a little
                concerned,
                whom
                they allow to be the Publick
                Ministers
                of Religion in their Dominions,
                and so it must be, if we will allow
                them
                any Power in <hi>Religious matters;</hi>
                for nothing tends
                more to the advantage or injury of
                <hi>Religion,</hi>
                than good or bad Bishops
                and Pastors;
                and if the People may have their Vote in the choice of
                their Bishop, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                pleads,
                certainly
                the King may have his; not onely
                for himself, but for his People, who are
                committed
                to his care. And that this has
                been
                challenged
                by Christian Princes,
                and confirmed
                by the consent of the People, and never
                denied,
                or usurp'd on, but by the <hi>Papal</hi>
                power, for several Ages,
                and of late, by the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi>
                is
                evident from that Learned
                Account the <hi>Dean</hi> has
                given
                us
              
              of this matter. But (the King) <hi>is
                not intrusted
                to chuse
                our Physicians,
                our Wives,
                our Diet, c.</hi> Truly,
                he would have a very troublesom
                work of it, if he were;
                and yet no man is
                an
                allowed
                Pysician,
              
              
              
              but by some Authority derived
                from the King, as from the Power of the
                Universities,
                in conferring
                Degrees,
                or of the Colledge
                of Physicians,
                in granting
                Licenses,
                <hi>c.</hi> which are originally
                owing
                to <hi>Royal Charters:</hi>
                and thus the King does
                chuse
                our Physicians
                for us. But is
                there no difference between the King's Power in
                matters
                of Publick
                Concernment,
                in the great Affairs
                of Church and State, and his intermedling
                with all the little Intrigues
                and Amours
                of private Families?
                It is
                an
                admirable Reason this; Princes
                must not chuse
                our Wives
                for us, therefore they are not concerned
                to take care of our Souls,
                nor of the Publick
                Administrations
                of Religion; they must not govern our private
                Families,
                therefore they must not govern the Kingdom; and yet, let
                me tell Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his ear, that if he
                marry a Wife,
                or wear any cloaths,
                or eat any Diet forbidden
                by the King's Ecclesiastical
                or Civil Laws,
                he is
                accountable
                for it; that is,
                our most private, and personal Concernments,
                as far as they fall under publick
                cognisance, or under the Government of the King; and
                therefore, their Choice, even in these
                matters,
                is
                not so absolutely
                free,
              
              
              but that it is
                confined
                within certain Laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, <hi>if a Papist, Heretick,
                or a hater of Pastoral Holiness, should ever be King, in
                how sad a case are the Peoples
                Souls?</hi>
                Now, I might answer this, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                does
                in a like case about Toleration, that <hi>the Magistrate
                is
                Judge whom
                he will</hi>
              
              <hi>tolerate, but he must judge aright.</hi> Thus the King
                must judge what Bishops
                and Ministers
                the people shall have, but he must judge <hi>aright;</hi>
                but, if <hi>he be a Papist,
                c.</hi> he is
                as likely to judge <hi>wrong</hi> about Toleration, as
                about the Choice of Bishops;
                but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes
                no Objection
                against this, unless when he says,
                <hi>they must judge aright,</hi> he
                means,
                that they must not be Judges
                when they don't judge aright, and then they never are
                Supreme Judges,
                if others may judge over their Judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this is
                Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way, common to all, who design to disturb
                and Libell
                the Government of Church or State, to
                dispute
                against wholsom
                Constitutions
                from extraordinary Events,
                which may, or may not happen: we must not submit to two or
                three <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi>
                for fear the Church should appoint five hundred; and a
                Christian, Protestant,
              
              
              
              Religious Prince, must have nothing to do in the choice of
                Bishops,
                because, if we should have a Popish, Heretical Prince,
                <hi>the Peoples
                Souls
                were
                in a sad case.</hi> While all sorts
                of Governments
                are exercised
                by men,
                who are fallible Creatures,
                and do not alwayes
                understand
                their Rule, and, much less, comply
                with it, no Form of Government can be secure from all
                inconveniences,
                and a Popular Government, least of any: and therefore,
                whatever may happen,
                the choice of a King is
                liable to as few Inconveniences,
                as the choice of the People, who may as soon turn
                Papists
                and Hereticks
                as Princes;
                and are as subject to Schism as they are to
                Faction.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this Objection, and many like it,
                proceeds
                upon this mistake, that there must be the same Rule for
                all Cases,
                ordinary and
                extraordinary; as if People were
                equally
                obliged
                to submit to a Popish
                Bishop, promoted
                by a Popish Prince, as to submit to a Protestant
                Bishop,
                promoted
                by a Protestant Prince. Every Sovereign Prince, whatever
                his Religion be, will, as far as he can,
                establish
                his own Religion; and, though such
                Princes
                abuse that Power which God
              
              
              has
                entrusted
                them
                with, when they set up and encourage a false Religion, and
                persecute the Professors
                of the true Religion, as they do, when they make unjust
                and tyrannical Laws;
                yet certainly,
                this is
                no Argument, that a Prince, who
                imbraces
                the true Religion, ought not to use his Power for the
                promoting
                of it; and there cannot be a more effectual way to do
                this, than by taking
                care, that the great Ministers
                of Religion are such as deserve that
                Honour, and
                will be faithful in the discharge
                of so great a Trust: and to argue,
                that Wise and Religious Princes
                are not to intermeddle in Religion,
                because bad
                Princes
                are not fit for it, is,
                <hi>as if mens wilful and wicked
                indispositions
                would change the Office, and disoblige both
                them
                and those that are guilty of no such unfitness, from the
                obligations
                laid
                upon them
                by the Lord: they may as wisely
                say, that a sober Physician is
                obliged
                to no more than a drunken
                one can perform, or, that a seeing
                man may do no more than the blind can do; or, that a
                Learned
                Prince may not meddle with Learning,
                because an
                Unlearned
                Prince is
                not fit for it.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                formerly
                reasoned,
                and very truly,
                in his Epistle Dedicatory
              
              
              
              before his <hi>five Disputations
                of Church-Government and Worship.</hi> And, as for the
                Souls
                of men,
                they are indeed by this means
                exposed
                to great Temptations,
                when they cannot enjoy the liberty
                of their Religion without Persecution:
                but this is
                nothing but what our Saviour hath
                taught
                us to expect, and what God many
                times
                permits
                for the good of his Church. Christianity
                is
                the Religion of the Cross, and therefore
                the most difficult Cases
                you can put, with respect to external
                suffering,
                can be no Argument against the obligation of any Christian
                Duty; and yet this is
                the onely
                difficulty you can name, for men,
                who love their Souls
                better than their Bodies,
                Lives,
                or Estates,
                may save their Souls,
                whatever be the Religion of their Prince.

              N. 73. But he charges
                these <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi>
                that <hi>they hold, that Patrons,
                be they never so ignorant or ungodly, must
                chuse
                all that shall have the Parochial trust of
                Souls.</hi>
                And does
                this make them
                Schismaticks,
                that they will not deny men
                their legal Estates
                and Inheritance, as the Right of Patronage
                is?
                But he sayes,
                <hi>(as to the possession of Temples
                and Tythes
                we yield it.)</hi> Well, what is
                the
              
              
              Quarrel then, for that is
                all they pretend
                to dispose of? Why, he is
                troubled,
                that such men
                must have the cure of Souls,
                and that the People must chuse
                no other, but what such a drunken
                Patron chuses
                for them;
                that is,
                he is
                angry that he cannot separate the Temple and
                Tithes
                from the Cure of Souls,
                and turn all the Livings
                of <hi>England</hi>
                into <hi>Sine-cures,</hi>
                that the Parish Priest may take care that no body
                runs
                away with the Church, while they run away with the Flock;
                and then, if ever a Rump Parliament
                gets
                up again, this will be an
                admirable Argument to prove Temples,
                and Tythes,
                and Ministers,
                useless; and, in the mean time, it would be
                an
                excellent occasion to declame
                against unfaithful and unpreaching
                Ministers
                and dumb Dogs,
                when their People are so divided
                and scatter'd, that it is
                impossible to preach to them
                without the help of the speaking
                Trumpet.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, suppose there be so many drunken
                Patrons,
                as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> intimates,
                they can present none but ordained
                Ministers,
                and, if they be not qualified
                for such a charge, it is
                the Bishop's fault who ordains
                them,
                not the Patron's,
              
              
              
              who presents
                them,
                and if the Bishop of the Diocese be
                duely
                informed,
                that the Person presented
                be either so vicious
                or ignorant, that he is
                not qualified
                for such a Cure, he may refuse to grant
                him
                institution, or may suspend or deprive
                him
                afterwards;
                and therefore the Patron's Right of Presentation can do no
                hurt, if other Persons
                concerned
                in it do their Duty; and certainly,
                the Presentation of the Patron, and the
                Approbation
                of the Bishop, is
                as likely a way to prevent any great
                miscarriages,
                as the Choice of a giddy, ignorant
                People, who
                seldom like what they do themselves
                long together.

              There are some other pretty notes
                of a Schismatick
                scattered
                here and there, which cannot well be
                reduced
                under any certain Head; as <hi>n. 70. They
                separate
                from us and our Congregations,
                as unlawful
                to be joyned
                with;</hi> that is,
                those are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
                who think it unlawful to joyn
                in Schismatical Assemblies:
                and <hi>n.</hi> 75. it is
                a note of a Schismatick,
                <hi>to charge the Nonconformists
                with suspicions
                of Rebellion:</hi> and <hi>n.</hi> 77. to represent
                them
                <hi>as intolerable, seditious Schismaticks.</hi>
                Good men!
                who were
                never Rebells,
                but sometimes
                <hi>followed
                Providence,</hi> and
              
              
              were
                never Schismaticks,
                but onely
                reformed
                the <hi>Church</hi> into <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
                and separate Meetings.
                But the pleasantest
                charge is,
                <hi>n.</hi> 78. that <hi>by these
                means,</hi>
                that is,
                by thus scandalizing
                the Loyal and Uniting
                Non-conformists,
                <hi>Families
                are distracted,
                Husbands
                against Wives,
                Parents
                against Children.</hi>
                This, I confess, is
                a very deplorable Case, and whoever
                is
                the cause of it is
                certainly
                a Schismatick:
                but, I perceive I have hitherto
                been
                in a mistake; for I thought that those who
                reproached
                an
                Excellent Church, and drew
                People from our Communion, occasion'd these unhappy
                Divisions
                in <hi>Families,</hi>
              
              for before this, Husband and Wife,
                Children
                and Servants
              
              
              
              were
                all of a Religion, but now we many
                times
                find as many different Religions
                in Families,
                as there are Persons
                of Age to profess any Religion. But, I perceive now, that
                that which makes
                these Distractions
                in Families,
                is,
                that some Schismatical <hi>Diocesan
                Canoneers,</hi>
                by preaching
                against <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
                perswade
                some Masters
                of Familes to come to Church, and to bring their
                Wives,
                and Children,
                and Servants
                along with them,
                and if they be refractory,
                and will not obey his commands,
                he sayes,
                <hi>some turn them
                out, if they do but hear a Non-conformist Preacher, while
                sensuality corrupteth
                youth, and needeth
                more restraint:</hi> So that those are
                Schismaticks,
                who perswade
                men
                to continue
                in the Communion of the Church, and to govern their own
                Families,
                that are under their care, and not to suffer giddy Youth
                to run after their own Inventions,
                to be poisoned
                with ill Principles;
                or, under pretence of going
                to <hi>Coventicles,</hi>
                take up by the way at Ale-houses,
                or worse places.
                Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well sayes,
                that <hi>Sensuality corrupts
                youth,</hi> and this ought to be
                restrained,
                and whoever will do so, must keep their
                Children
                and Servants
                under their Eye,
              
              
              especially
                on the Lord's Day; for I will be bold to say, what
                constant Experience
                proves,
                that more Youth have been
                debauched
                this last Age, by the pretence of
                running
                to <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
                than by any one means
                besides.
                But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does
                very finely
                insinuate, that Parents
                and Masters
                should not restrain their Children
                and Servants
                from going
                to <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
                but onely
                to take care of their manners,
                and let them
                chuse
                their Religion themselves; Excellent
                Divinity,
                and certainly
                the most effectual way to make Atheists
                and Fanaticks
                in the World. <hi>Sensuality</hi>
                is
                a very bad thing, but such Liberty of Conscience as this,
                is
                the ready way to bring in <hi>Sensuality</hi>
                and all other Evils.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, I fear I shall be severely
                censured,
                for taking
                notice of such weak and trifling
                Suggestions
                as these; and after
                what I have said,
                I think I may trust any impartial Reader, to pass
                Judgment
                upon the <hi>Diocesan Canoneer,</hi>
                who can never be charged
                with Schism, if this be the worst of his Case; yet I begin
                to suspect now, that he intended
                to prove his <hi>mere present Nonconformist</hi> to be the
                <hi>Schismatick,</hi>
                for, he has
                stated
                his Case
              
              
              
              too, in eighty three Particulars;
                and, though some of them
                seem to be spoken
                of in favour of him,
                yet I find nothing that clears
                him
                from the guilt of Schism: for, let
                men
                tell never so many fine Stories,
                be they true or false, he is
                a Schismatick
                who is
                guilty of a causeless Separation;
                and if the <hi>Dioc_san
                Canoneer</hi>
                be not the Schismatick,
                the mere <hi>Nonconformist</hi>
                must be the man. What is
                material in the case of the <hi>Non-conformist,</hi>
                will fall in under another Head, and therefore I shall
                take leave at present, of this <hi>Search,</hi> only
                advising
                Mr. <hi>B.</hi> once in his Life, to give us a few
                Arguments,
                and leave off stating
                Cases.

            proved
            to be a Catholick

          <p>
            IT is
              a very different thing, to propose
              terms
              of Accommodation, to patch up a Peace between
              Churches
              of distinct and separate Communions,
              and to restore the Church to that Peace and Unity, which
              is
              essential to it, considered
              as a Church. Though it were
              possible to
              make a lasting
              Truce between separate Churches,
              that they shall not undermine, nor
              vilifie,
              nor persecute each other (though this
              is
              not so easie
              neither, as some may imagine) which
              is
              like the Leagues
              and Confederacies
              between Sovereign Princes,
              who owe no Dependance
              nor Subordination to each other; yet this
              is
              not the Unity of the Christian Church, for the Schism
              remains
              while there is
              a causeless Separation;
              and while there is
              a Schism, the Church is
              not one, no more than the
            
            
            
            natural Body would be, did
              every Member live and act apart, though they
              did
              not quarrel with each other. Such a Confederacy as this, may
              maintain some Peace and Order in Civil
              Societies,
              and make our Lives
              more easie
              and pleasant, than when we are engaged
              in perpetual Quarrels,
              but it serves
              no purposes
              of Religion; it neither removes
              the Scandal, nor the danger of Schism, which both
              undermines
              Christianity,
              and destroys
              mens Souls.
          </p>
          <p>And therefore to let all the World see, how little those
            men
            are for Union who talk so much of it, and raise such a mighty
            noise and clamour to call it back, I shall, as
            briefly
            as I can, shew
            wherein the nature of Christian Union
            consists,
            what that Union is,
            which is
            essential to the Christian Church, and I shall reduce all to
            these three Heads.</p>
          <p>First, That the Union of the
            Christian
            Church, is
            a Catholick
            Union, or the Union of the Church
            Catholick.</p>
          <p>Secondly,
            that this Union consists
            in one Communion.</p>
          <p>
            Thirdly,
              to prevent Objections,
              I shall consider the Difference between that Communion,
              which is
              essential to
            
            
            a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church, to a national Church, and to the
              Church universal.
          </p>
          <p>First, That the Union of the
            Christian
            Church is
            a Catholick
            Union; that is,
            such an
            Union as makes
            the whole Church of Christ <hi>one body;</hi> for, the Apostle
            tells
            us, that <hi>there is
            but one body,</hi>
            as well as <hi>one Spirit, and one Lord, and one Faith, and
            one Baptism,</hi> c. 4 <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4, 5, 6. Now if
            Christ have but one Church, which
            is
            his Body, and his Spouse, that alone
            is
            the true Christian
            Unity, which unites
            all the particular
            Churches
            in the World into <hi>one Body,</hi> or which
            unites
            any particular Church to the <hi>Catholick
            Church.</hi></p>
          <p>It is
            not sufficient to Christian Union,
            that the Christians
            of one Nation or one Congregation, are
            united
            among themselves, unless they be
            united
            to the <hi>Catholick
            Church;</hi> for, if there be but one Church, a whole Nation
            may be Schismatical, as well as single
            persons,
            and there can be nothing objected
            against this,
            without denying
            the very Notion of a <hi>Catholick
            Church,</hi> and asserting,
            that Christ has
            not one, but twenty
            or a hundred several Bodies,
            according
            to the number of various Sects
            and Parties
            of Christians.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            Now, methinks
              there should be no need to prove that Christ
              has
              but one Church dispersed
              over all the World; for though indeed we read of several
              Churches,
              as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of
              <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the seven
              Churches
              of <hi>Asia,</hi> yet these are
              called
              Churches,
              only as they are homogeneal
              parts
              of the same Body. All these particular
              Churches
              having
              all the Essentials
              of a Church, as to Faith, Government,
              Discipline; every one is
              called
              a Church, as every drop of Water
              is
              called
              Water, as well as a River, or the Sea;
            
            the Universal Church consists
              of all these particular Churches,
              as similar parts,
              which have the same Nature, and make up one Body, by a
              common Union.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Universal Church indeed, in the first
              Beginnings
              of Christianity, was
              not so large as many particular
              Congregations
              are now; before the day of <hi>Pentecost, The number of the
              names
              together,
              were
              about an
              hundred and twenty,</hi> 1 <hi>Acts</hi>
              15. And to them
              were
              three thousand added
              on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> who
              were
              converted
              by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s preaching,
              2 <hi>Acts</hi>
              41. <hi>Thus the Lord added
            
            
            to the Church daily, such as should be
              saved,</hi>
              v. 47. And the Gospel was
              by degrees
              propagated
              into other Countries,
              by the unwearied
              Labours
              of the Apostles,
              and especially
              of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but yet it
              continued
              one Church still, as the Apostle
              assures
              the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
              after he had
              planted
              so many Churhes in different and remote
              Countries,
              that there is
              but <hi>one Body,</hi> 4 <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and
              compares
              the Unity of the Christian Church to the Unity of a Natural
              Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And that we may
              known,
              that he does
              not speak this of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in
              particular, but of the Universal Church, he
              adds,
              <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>And God hath
              set some in the Church, first, Apostles,
              secondarily,
              Prophets,
              thirdly,
              Teachers;
              after that, Miracles,
              then Gifts
              of Healing,
              Helps,
              Governments,
              Diversities
              of Tongues.</hi>
              Now it is
              plain, that these several sorts
              of Ministeries
              and Gifts,
              did
              not peculiarly
              belong to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor to any
              Particular, but to the Universal Church: For Instance, the
              Apostolical Order was
              for the Propagation of Christianity
              all the World over; and therefore
              this Church, which is
              one, as the natural Body is
              one, is
              the Catholick
              Church.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            This was
              the Sence
              of the ancient Christians,
              (of which, more hereafter) as we learn from
            
            St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whose words
              are to this Effect.
            <q>
              The Church is
                one, though she fruitfully
                encrease
                into a multitude, and spread her self far and near; as the
                Rayes
                of the Sun are many, but the Light
                is
                one, and a Tree which hath
                many Branches,
                hath
                but one Stock, upheld
                by a firm and tenacious Root; and when
                many
                Rivers
                flow from one Fountain, though they divide themselves into
                different Streams,
                through the great plenty and abundance of Water, yet they
                are all but one, as flowing
                from the same Head and Fountain. Try if you can pluck the
                Rayes
                from the Sun, they will shine no
                longer
                than they are united
                to that Body of Light; cut a Branch from the Tree, and see
                whether it will blossom, or bring forth Fruit after such a
                separation;
              
              
              part a River from that plentiful
                Fountain
                which supplies
                it, and it immediately
                grows
                dry; thus the Church, which shines
                with a Divine Light, and diffuses
                its
                Rayes
                through all the World is
                but one Light, which will admit of no decision, but
                continues
                still united
                in one Body; like a fruitful
                Tree, it sends
                forth its
                Branches
                on all sides,
                and, like an
                overflowing
                Fountain, divides
                into different Streams,
                and waters
                all the dry and barren corners
                of the Earth, but yet there is
                but one Head, one original Fountain, one Mother
                blessed
                with a numerous off-spring.
            </q>
            From whence it appears,
              that it was
              St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s judgment
              (as indeed it was
              the received
              Opinion of that Age of the Church, and of several
              Ages
              after, and never questioned
              till this last Age of New Lights)
              that it was
              as impossible for a particular Church to retain the nature
              and privileges
              and saving
              vertue
              and Graces
              of a Church in a state of Separation from the
              Catholick
              Church, as it is
              for the Beams
              of the Sun to give Light, when they are cut off from the
              Body of the Sun, or for a River to be
              replenished
              with Waters,
              when it has
              no
            
            
            
            communication with the Fountain, or for a Branch to
              flourish, when it is
              broke
              off from the Tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, I observe farther from St.
              <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
              words,
              that the Catholick
              Church, though it consist of all particular
              Churches,
              which are contained
              in it, yet is
              not a mere arbitrary Combination
              and Confederacy of particular Churches,
              but is
              the root and fountain of Unity, and, in order of Nature,
              antecedent
              to particular Churches,
              as the Sun is
              before its
              Beams,
              and the Root before its
              Branches,
              and the Fountain before the Rivers
              which flow from it: that particular
              Churches
              are made
              by the increase and propagation of the
              Catholick
              Church, not the Catholick
              Church by the combination of particular
              Churches;
              and therefore nothing is
              more familiar in the Writings
              of the ancient Fathers,
              than to hear of <hi>Ecclesiae
              Catholicae,</hi> and <hi>Episcopi Catholici;</hi> for those
              particular Churches
              and Bishops
              were
              called
              <hi>Catholick
              Churches</hi>
              and <hi>Catholick
              Bishops,</hi>
              who lived
              in Communion
              with the <hi>Catholick
              Church;</hi> so that particular
              Churches
              received
              their denomination
              from the Catholick
              Church, and none were
              accounted
              true Churches;
            
            
            but as they were
              considered
              as Parts
              and Branches,
              and Members
              of the Catholick
              Church, which were
              plain Nonsense,
              if the Catholick
              Church were
              nothing else but an
              aggregate body, made
              up of an
              arbitrary Combination of particular
              Churches;
              for then, they must be considered
              as true Churches,
              standing
              by themselves, antecedent to any respect to their Union with
              the Catholick
              Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is
              a matter of great Consequence, which
              utterly
              tears
              up the very Foundations
              of <hi>Independency,</hi> and therefore
              deserves
              to be more fully
              explained,
              and indeed there is
              some need of it; for, it sounds
              very odly,
              to say that the Catholick
              Church is,
              in order of Nature, before particular
              Churches;
              whereas, if we will allow that Christianity
              had
              a Beginning,
              and was
              gradually
              propagated
              in the World, according
              to that account we have of it's Rise and Growth in the
              <hi>Acts
              of the Apostles,</hi>
              we must acknowledge, that the number of
              Christians
              was
              so small at first, that they could make but a very little
              Congregation,
              and the Church was
              first planted
              in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> before the Gospel
              was
              preached
              in other parts
              of the World,
            
            
            
            which was
              first occasion'd by the Persecution
              that was
              raised
              against the Christians
              at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi>
              8. which drove them
              into other Countries,
              where they preached
              the Gospel, and converted
              men
              to the Faith of Christ; so that the first
              Beginning
              of a Christian Church was
              a single Congregation, and the particular Church of
              <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> But then the Church
              became
              Catholick
              and Universal, when the Gospel was
              preached,
              and Christian Societies
              were
              formed
              after the first original pattern, in all
              parts
              of the World.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this is
              very true also, that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (or the
              Christian Church, and the State of the Gospel)
              <hi>is
              like to a Grain of Mustard seed, which a</hi>
            
            <hi>man took,
              and sowed
              in his Field, which indeed is
              the least of all Seeds;
              but when it is
              grown,
              it is
              the greatest
              among Herbs,
              and becometh
              a Tree, so that the Birds
              of the Air come and lodge in the
              Branches
              thereof:</hi> that is,
              that the Beginnings
              of the Christian Church are very small, but it
              vastly
              increases
              in a short time, and spreads
              it self over all the World; and therefore, if by the
              Catholick
              Church, we mean no more, than that Church which
              is
              in all parts
              of the
            
            
            World, it is
              evident, that that Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
              was
              before the Catholick
              Church, that is,
              that the Church was
              planted
              in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before there
              was
              a Christian Church in any other
              Parts,
              much more, before there was
              a Christian
              Church in all parts
              of the World.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore, for answer to this, we must observe, that
              according
              to the ancient Fathers,
              there are two things
              included
              in the notion of the Catholick
              Church; first, that the Church is
              but one; secondly,
              that it is
              every where; for therefore it is
              called
              Catholick,
              because all the
              Churches
              in the Christian World, are but <hi>one Church.</hi> Thus
              St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Maximus,</hi>
              c. calls
              it <hi>Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitatem,</hi> the
            
            Unity of the Catholick
              Church. And <hi>Optatus</hi> affirms,
              That <hi>besides
              one Church, which is
              the Catholick
              Church, the other</hi>
            
            <hi>Churches,
              which Hereticks
              seem to have, are not Churches;</hi>
              and that <hi>there is
              but one Church, which Christ calls
              his Dove and Spouse.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his
              Book of <hi>The Unity of the Church,</hi>
              proves
              at large, from express Scripture, and ancient
              Types,
              that the Church of
            
            
            
            Christ is
              but one. And St. <hi>Augustin</hi>
            
            calls
              the Catholick
              Church, the <hi>Catholick
              Communion, Catholick
              Peace, Catholick
              Unity;</hi> which shews,
              that the Unity of
              the Church was
              the principal thing they regarded
              in the notion of the Catholick
              Church; for ten thousand
              Schismatical Conventicles,
              which have no Union among themselves,
              cannot make one
              Church, nor can that be a Catholick
              Church which is
              not one.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that though in the beginnings
              of Christianity, the true Church of Christ
              was
              confined
              to one small Congregation,
              yet it was
              the Catholick
              Church, because it was
              that one Church of Christ, which
              was
              to increase and spread it self over all the World, not by
              infinite
              divisions
              into new Independent Churches,
              but by multiplying
              it self into numerous Churches,
              living
              in the same Catholick
              Communion and Unity:
              and therefore we read in <hi>Acts</hi>
              2. 47. when great numbers
              were
              daily converted
              to Christianity, not that they increased
              into new Churches,
              but
            
            
            that they were
              added
              to the Church; <hi>The Lord added
              to the Church daily such as should be
              saved.</hi>
              This is
              what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              sayes,
              that, though the Church be never so much
              increased,
              yet there is
              but <hi>unum caput, una origo, una
              mater
              foecunditatis successibus copiosa,</hi> as I
              observed
              before; all these Churches
              proceed from one root and cause, are the
              Children
              of the same Mother, which make still but one Family and
            
            one Church. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi>
              having
              given
              an
              account when the Gospel was
              propagated,
              and Churches
              planted,
              by the Apostles,
              beginning
              at <hi>Judaea,</hi> and so preaching
              in all parts
              of the World, adds,
              that hence it is,
              that so many and so great Churches
              are but that one Church, first planted
              by the Apostles,
              from whence all others come: thus all are first and
              Apostolical, while all together
              prove that Unity which makes
              them
              all one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, nothing can be more agreeable
              to this notion of Catholick
              Unity, than the Parables
              of our Saviour, and the familiar
              expressions
              of Scripture, whereby the Unity of the Church
              is
              described.
              Thus the Church in this World is
              compared
              to a <hi>Field,</hi> wherein the
            
            
            
            <hi>Sower sowed
              good corn,</hi> but <hi>the Enemy</hi>
            
            <hi>sowed
              Tares;</hi>
              whereby our Saviour means,
              the mixture of good and bad men
              in the visible Church, but it is
              but one Church, one Field still, while they live in the same
              Communion. Thus, to
            
            the same purpose, <hi>the Kingdom of
              Heaven
              is
              compared
              to a net which was
              cast into the Sea, and gathered
              of every kind, both good and bad fish;</hi> which must be
              meant
              of the Visible Church on Earth, because bad
              men
              are not admitted
              into Heaven; but
              the <hi>Angels
              shall come forth, and sever the wicked from the just,</hi>
              and yet the Church in this World
              is
              but one <hi>net;</hi> thus it is
              compared
              to <hi>a grain of mustard-seed,</hi> which
              grows
              into one
            
            tree; <hi>to leaven,
              which a woman took
              and hid
              in three measures
              of meal, till the whole was
              leavened,</hi>
              but it was
              but one lump
            
            or Mass still; <hi>to a woman cloathed
              with</hi>
            
            <hi>the Sun, and the Moon under her
              feet;</hi>
              to the Spouse of Christ, which certainly
              is
              but one, as the ancient Church did
              constantly
              believe, and is
              as firmly
              united
              to Christ, as man and Wife, who are one flesh, which the
              Apostle calls
              <hi>a great mystery,</hi> and makes
              it an
            
            Argument to men
              to love their Wives,
              <hi>as Christ loved
              his Church.</hi> Thus the
            
            
            Church is
              the <hi>House,</hi> the <hi>Building,</hi> the <hi>Temple of
              God,</hi> which must signifie
              Unity; for God
              has
              but one Temple and House, whereof the Temple at
              <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
              was
              a Type, which, by the express command of God,
              was
              to be but one.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is
              one thing more observable,
              of great Moment in this case, that Christ
              calls
              himself a <hi>Shepheard,</hi>
              and his Church a <hi>Sheepfold,</hi> and
              declares,
              that there shall be but one Fold, as there
              is
              but one Shepheard;
              <hi>And other Sheep I</hi>
            
            <hi>have, which are not of this Fold, and they shall hear my
              Voice, and there shall be one Fold and one
              Shepheard.</hi>
              Now, if we consider who these two
              sorts
              of Sheep are, of whom
              our Saviour speaks,
              and how they are united
              into <hi>one Fold,</hi> it will be
              an
              evident demonstration of the Unity of the
              Catholick
              Church. Those first sort of Sheep our Saviour
              mentions,
              signifie
              the <hi>Lost
              Sheep of the House of</hi> Israel,
              who were
              his peculiar Care, while he was
              on Earth, as he tells
              the Woman of <hi>Canaan, 15 Math. 24. I
              am
              not sent,
              but to the lost
              Sheep of the House of</hi> Israel; and to these only he
              sends
              his Apostles
              to preach, 10 <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 6. His other Sheep
              were
              the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              who were
              also to be called
              to the Supper, to be invited
            
            
            
            
            to the Faith of Christ, and Communion of the Church, as St.
              <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
              told
              the <hi>Jews,</hi>
              when they <hi>contradicted
              and blasphemed,
              It was
              necessary, that the Word of God should first have
              been
              spoken
              to you; but seeing
              you put it from you, and judge your
              selves
              unworthy of everlasting
              Life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles;
              for, so hath
              the Lord commanded
              us, saying,
              I</hi>
            
            <hi>have set thee
              to be a Light to the Gentiles,
              that thou shouldest
              be for Salvation to the ends
              of the Earth.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Now, the way whereby these two
            sorts
            of Sheep become <hi>one Fold,</hi>
            is
            by receiving
            the Gentiles
            into the Communion
            of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Christian Church; for Christ
            did
            not destroy the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, no more than he
            did
            the Law and the Prophets,
            but only refine and perfect it into a Christian Church.</p>
          <p>
            Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
              the converted
              Gentiles,
              who were
              apt to glory over the unbelieving
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              as unchurched,
              and rejected
              by God; <hi>If some of the</hi>
            
            <hi>Branches
              be broken
              off,</hi> (that is,
              the unbelieving
              <hi>Jews)
              and thou being
              a wild Olive Tree, wert
              grafted
              in amongst them,
              and with them
              partakest
              of the Root and Fatness of the Olive Tree, boast not against
              the Branches,
              but if thou boast, thou bearest
            
            
            not the Root, but the Root thee;</hi>
              so the Gentiles
              became
              the Church of God, by being
              grafted
              into the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church. By the <hi>Root,</hi> *
              Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> understands
            
            the Patriarchs,
              but especially
              <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was
              the Father of the Faithful; that
              is,
              the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church began
              in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was
              founded
              on that promise, which God made
              to him,
              <hi>That in his Seed all the Nations
              of the World should be blessed.</hi>
              And when the Apostle teaches
              the Gentile Converts
              to treat the <hi>Jews</hi>
              with all Modesty and Respect from that Consideration,
              <hi>Thou bearest
              not the Root, but the Root thee;</hi>
              the meaning
              is,
              that
            
            those Priviledges
              which they enjoy in the Communion of the Church, do not
              originally
              belong to
              themselves, but to the <hi>Jews:</hi>
              the believing
              Jews
              continue still united
              to their own root, and the believing
              Gentiles
              are grafted
              on the Jewish Root, and enjoy all these
              Priviledges
              by their Union
            
            
            
            to the Jewish Church. Thus the Apostle
            
            adds,
              <hi>For if thou wert
              cut out of the Olive Tree, which
              is
              wild by Nature, and wert
              grafted
              contrary to nature, into a good Olive Tree;</hi> which
              is
              an
              evident Proof, that the Gentile
              Converts
              did
              not make a new Church, but were
              received
              into the Jewish Church, and so became
              one Fold.

          <p>
            This St. <hi>Paul</hi> discourses
              at large, in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
              and
            
            represents
              the Union of Jews
              and Gentiles,
              by the pulling
              down <hi>the middle</hi>
            
            <hi>Wall of Partition,</hi> which
              is
              an
              Allusion to that Partition in the Temple, which
              separated
              between the court of the Gentiles,
              and the place where the Jews
              worshipped:
              and thus they became
              one Church, by admitting
              the Gentiles
              to equal Priviledges,
              to the same Communion,
              and to as near an
              Approach to God as the Jews,
              which is
              called
              <hi>reconciling
              them
              in one Body,</hi> which makes

              (that is,
              the Gentiles,
              who as he tells
              them,
              <hi>v. 12. Were
              Aliens
              from the Commonwealth of</hi> Israel, <hi>and

              of God's People, the <hi>Commonwealth of</hi>
              Israel, then
              their being
              made

              <hi>c. of the Houshold
              of God,</hi> signifies
              their being
              received
              into the Communion and Priviledges
              of God's <hi>Israel.</hi> And they are
              said
              to be <hi>built
              upon the Foundation of the</hi>
            
            <hi>Apostles
              and Prophets,
              Jesus Christ himself
              being
              the chief Corner-stone;</hi> which
              shews,
              that it is
              the same Church still, which is
              founded
              on the Prophets,
              and perfected
              by the preaching
              of the Apostles;
              and Christ is
              called
              the chief corner-stone,
              because he unites
              Jews
              and Gentiles
              into one Building, as the corner-stone
              unites
              both sides
              of the house, and holds
              them
              together. For before the appearing
              of Christ, God himself made
              a Separation between Jews
              and Gentiles,
              <hi>But now in Christ Jesus, we who</hi>
            
            <hi>sometimes
              were
              afar off, are made
              nigh by the Blood of Christ,</hi> who
              <hi>hath
              abolished,
              in his Flesh, the Enmity, even the Law of
              Commandments
              contained
              in Ordinances,
              for to make in himself, of twain, one new man, so
              making
              Peace. In whom,
              all the</hi>
            
            <hi>Building</hi> (Jews
              and Gentiles)
              <hi>fitly
              framed</hi>
            
            <hi>together, groweth
              into an
              holy Temple in the Lord.</hi>
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            Now nothing can be a plainer
              Demonstration
              of the Unity of the Catholick
              Church, than the Gentiles
              being
              received
              into, and incorporated
              with the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church; for, all
              men
              who understand any thing of these
              matters,
              must, and do acknowledge, that the Jewish Church, <hi>the
              Commonwealth of</hi> Israel,
              was
              but one Church, and one Commonwealth; and if the Gentile
              Converts
              do not make a new Church, but only enlarge the
              bounds
              of the <hi>Israelitish</hi>
              Church, it is
              plain, that the Catholick
              Church continues
              as much one, as the Jewish Church
              was
              before the appearing
              of Christ, and the Conversion
              of the Gentile World. This the believing
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              themselves understood
              at the Beginnings
              of Christianity, that the Gentiles
              were
              received
              into their Church, by believing
              the Gospel, which made
              them
              so vehemently
              urge the necessity
              of Circumcision, as judging
              it impossible, that any man should be
              incorporated
              into the body of <hi>Israel,</hi>
              without
              Circumcision, which was
              the sign of God's Covenant with
              them,
              and which separated
              them
              from the rest of the World. And this
              made
              so many believing
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              so zealous for the Observation
            
            
            of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
              because they looked
              upon Christianity only as an
              Addition to <hi>Judaism,</hi> not as a total change and
              alteration of it.
          </p>
          <p>I doubt not, but the Unity of the Jewish Church,
            considered
            as a Type of the Christian Church,
            is
            a very good Argument to prove the Christian Church to be but
            one, as I am
            abundantly
            satisfied
            from those very mean and slender
            Objections,
            made
            against it by learned
            men;
            for though, as some argue, the Christian Church
            is
            designed
            to excell
            the Jewish Church, and therefore
            doth not correspond with it in every
            thing, yet, I hope there is
            not a greater
            Excellency than Union, unless it be a more perfect and
            excellent Union, and that we will grant to the Christian
            Church; but yet I think this perfection of Union in the
            Church, does
            not consist in
            dividing
            or multiplying
            the Church into a great many loose, incoherent,
            independent
            Churches,
            which are nited like a Rope of Sand.</p>
          <p>
            Much less does
              it hence follow, <hi>That all Christians
              should annually
              meet in one place,</hi> any more than that they should keep
              the Feast of the Passover, of <hi>Pentecost,</hi>
              or Tabernacles.
              There are some
            
            
            
            things
              peculiar to them
              as one Nation, others as a Typical Church, others as
              typical of
              Catholick
              Unity: and he who knows
              not how to distinguish these things,
              shall perplex and entangle himself,
              but neither satisfie
              his Reader, nor convince his Adversary.
          </p>
          <p>Much less does
            it hence follow, <hi>That Christians
            should have one Arch-Priest on Earth,</hi> when the Jewish
            High Priest was
            a Type of that great High Priest, who
            was
            not so much to exercise his Priest-hood on Earth, as in
            Heaven, if we will believe
            the Author of the Epistle to the
            <hi>Hebrews,
            7 Heb.</hi> and several other places.</p>
          <p>
            And 'tis as groundless a conceit, from hence to conclude,
              <hi>That we should be all subject to one temporal
              Jurisdiction, and speak one Language,</hi> which
              was
              peculiar to them,
              as one Commonwealth and Kingdom,
              not as one Church: The Jews
              continued
              one Church under the <hi>Babylonish</hi>
              Captivity, where they neither met
              in one place annually,
              nor, it may be, spoke
              one Language; and yet, if we consider that the Commonwealth
              of <hi>Israel</hi> was
              a Theocracy under the immediate
              Government of God, and that <hi>Moses,</hi>
              and <hi>Joshua,</hi> and the Judges,
              and Kings
              of <hi>Israel,</hi> were
              immediately
              set up
            
            
            by God, as they who were
              to govern his People in his name, and by his
              Authority,
              and by his Order and Council, so they
              were
              Types
              of the Regal Power
              of Christ, who governs
              the Church in God's name, and according
              to his Will, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was
              a Type of his priestly
              Office. Now this is
              an
              odd way of arguing
              from a typical Dispensation, to prove that the Antitype must
              be the very same
              with the Type; it is
              sufficient, if the Antitype have something that
              answers
              the Type, though it be more perfect
              and excellent in it's kind; as to be of one mind, and to
              speak the same things,
              is
              more excellent than to speak the same Language; and
              an
              universal and glorious Head in Heaven, who
              is
              both King and Priest, is
              more perfect and excellent, than a King and Priest on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>There is
            a great Difference, I will grant, as it
            is
            objected,
            between a Church of one Nation, and of all the World, and they
            cannot upon all accounts
            be united
            in the same manner; but if the universal Church be
            united
            so, as to continue one body, it
            is
            sufficient; of which, more hereafter.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            And, whereas it is
              objected,
              <hi>That before
              the Law, Christian Religion, and
              consequently,
              a Christian Church, did,
              in substance
              subsist, but what Unity of Government
              was
              there then?</hi> It is
              impossible to give a direct answer to this, because we know
              not what precise time is
              meant;
              if the time before the Flood, we have a very imperfect
              account of those Ages,
              and yet have little Reason to doubt, but the antidiluvian
              Patriarchs,
              who preserved
              themselves from the general Corruptions
              of the Age, were
              careful to maintain a publick
              face of Religion, which necessarily
              supposes
              some kind of Union and Government. When all Flesh
              had
              corrupted
              it self, except <hi>Noah,</hi>
              the Church was
              confined
              to his Family,
              and preserved
              from the Deluge of Waters,
              in the Ark, which the ancient Fathers
              make a Type or Emblem of the Unity of the Church, out of
              which there is
              no Salvation. After the Flood, no doubt <hi>Noah</hi>
              himself was
              the high Priest, as well as universal Monarch of the new
              World; and some think, that <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi>
              to whom
              <hi>Abraham</hi> paid
              Tithes,
              was
              no other than <hi>Sem,</hi> one of <hi>Noah</hi>'s
              Sons.
              And when the Church was
              confined
              again to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, I
              suppose
            
            
            there is
              no difficulty to discover the Unity of it, even before the
              Law.
          </p>
          <p>But this seems
            to me a new way of reasoning,
            <hi>Christianity was
            in Substance before the Law,</hi> that
            is
            contained
            in some obscure Prophecies,
            and some good rules
            of Morality; but <hi>there was
            no Unity of Government,</hi> before there
            was
            a visible Christian Church, therefore the Unity of the
            <hi>Jewish Church</hi> is
            no type of the Unity of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> when it
            shall be catholick
            and visible: or there were
            some seeds
            of Christianity sown
            in the World, before the Law, but
            did
            not yet appear above ground; therefore there
            was
            a visible Christian Church, because there
            was
            an
            invisible Christianity;
            for no other Church is
            capable of external and visible Unity and
            Government:
            or there was
            no Unity of Government,
            before there was
            a visible Christian Church, therefore there must be none, now
            there is.</p>
          <p>
            And what is
              farther objected,
              that <hi>the temporal Union of the</hi>
              Jews
              <hi>might only figure the spiritual Unity of
              Christians,
              in Faith, Charity, and Peace,</hi> I grant it
              readily,
              if by Charity and Peace, is
              meant
              a Catholick
              Communion, which is
              the only true Charity and Peace of the Christian
            
            
            
            Church; but if only mutual Kindness, and
              forbearing
              Quarrels
              and Contentions,
              though men
              divide into distinct and independent
              Communions,
              it seems
              strange to me, how the Unity of Policy and Government in the
              Jewish Church, should figure no Unity of a Church, but
              an
              Unity of another kind, which does
              not belong to a Church, as a Church: for,
              men
              who are of no Church, nor under any civil or ecclesiastical
              Government,
              may love one another, and forbear
              Quarrels,
              but to be Members
              of the same civil or religious Society,
              certainly
              signifies
              some other kind of Union than this. When we
              enquire
              after the Unity of the Church we mean
              an
              external and
              visible Unity, which must signifie
              something more than that spiritual and invisible Union of
              Charity and Peace; for, there may be no great Peace, when
              men
              do not publickly
              fight with one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that unless there be some more material
              Objections,
              than I could ever yet see, the Unity of the Jewish Church
              considered
              in it's typical Nature, is
              a very good Argument to prove the
              Catholick
              Union in the Christian Church; but, when we consider
              farther, that
            
            
            the Jewish Church, as perfected
              by the express Revelations
              of the Gospel, is
              still the Root of Union, whereon the
              Gentile
              Christians
              are grafted,
              and so grow up into one Church; if the Jewish Church ever
              was
              one, it is
              so still; for the Jewish Church
              was
              not dissolved
              by Christianity, but enlarged
              by the Addition
              of Gentile Converts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law was
              but Christianity
              vailed
              by Types
              and Figures,
              and when the Vail was
              taken
              away, Christianity appeared
              in it's true Glory and Lustre: but it
              was
              the same Church vailed
              and unvailed;
              into the Communion
              of which Church, the Gentiles
              were
              received,
              the partition Wall of typical
              Ceremonies
              and Ordinances
              being
              taken
              away, and abolished
              by the death of Christ; and thus both
              Jews
              and Gentiles
              became
              one Sheep-fold under one Shepheard,
              which St. <hi>Austin</hi> upon the place
              tells
              us, signifies
              the Unity of the Church Catholick,
              and condemns
              the Schism of the Donatists.
              It were
              easie
              to add much more to prove Catholick
              Unity, that the whole universal Church
              is
              but one Body and Society of Christians;
              but this is
              enough at present, considering,
            
            
            
            that I shall add greater
              Light and Strength to it in what
              follows.

          <p>
            THE second thing to be considered,
              is,
              that the Unity of the Christian
              Church consists
              in one Communion;
              Catholick
              Unity signifies
              Catholick
              Communion, and one Communion signifies
              one Christian Society, of which all
              Christians
              are Members;
              for so the Church is
              called,
              , a Communion
              or Fellowship, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. To
              distinguish
              it from a Sect or Party: and to have a Right to Christian
              Communion, signifies
              of Right, to be a Member of this Society, a Member of the
              Body of Christ, or the Christian Church, to communicate in
              all the several duties
              and offices
              of Religion, with all Christians
              all the World over, and to partake
              in all the Priviledges
              of Christians,
            
            
            and to be admitted
              to the freedom of their Conversation, to eat, and drink, and
              discourse, and trade together. For in the first
              Ages
              of Christianity, Excommunication
              did
              not only shut men
              out of the Church, exclude them
              from their religious Assemblies,
              from the Communion
              of the Word, and Prayers,
              and Sacraments,
              but drove them
              from the civil Conversation of Christians;
              all Christians
              did
              avoid and fly from them,
              as rotten
              and putrid Members,
              which must be cut off from the Body, and
              perfectly
              separated
              from the conversation
              of Christians;
              no man would talk with them,
              or receive Visits
              from them,
              or entertain them
              at their Table, or
            
            call them
              Brethren, nor pray with them
              though in a private House, all which
              was
              expressly
              forbid in the Canons
              of some of the most ancient Councils,
              as <hi>Albaspinus</hi> has
              prov'd at large. And is
              very agreeable to the Apostolical
              Precept 2
              <hi>Thessal. 3. 14. And if any man obey not our Word by this
              Epistle, note that man, and have no company with
              him,
              that he may be ashamed.</hi>
              . And 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. I have
              written
              unto you not to keep Company, if any man that
              is
            
            
            
            called
              a Brother, be a Fornicator, or covetous,
              or an
              Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or
              an
              Extortioner, with such a one no not to eat;</hi> which
              plainly
              refers
              to common Conversation, for it forbids
              us to keep company with lewd and
              disorderly
              Christians
              in the same sense, as it allows
              us to keep company with other Sinners
              who are not Christians;
              and when he adds,
              <hi>with such a one not to eat,</hi> he
              represents
              this eating
              with these men,
              as a matter, in the Opinion of most
              men,
              of no great consequence, for so that phrase
              signifies,
              you shall not so much <hi>as do such a thing;</hi> whereas,
              the sacramental
              eating
              the body of Christ is
              one of the highest
              Acts
              of Christian Communion.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore, a Right to Christian Communion,
              signified
              a Right to be admitted
              to the Society of Christians,
              and to joyn
              with them
              in all the parts
              and offices,
              whether of a religious or civil
              Conversation,
              which is
              briefly
              comprehended
              by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in three
              things,
              <hi>Communicatio pacis, appellatio fraternitatis 
              contesseratio
              hospitalitatis, de praescript.
              cap.</hi> 20. in admitting
              them
              to the Peace of the Church, (of which more anon) in
              calling
              them
            
            
            Brethren, and in the mutual Offices
              of Hospitality; so that the Christian Church
              was
              such a Society, Body, and Community
              of men,
              as were
              strictly
              associated
              for all the Ends
              and Purposes
              of Religion
              and humane Life; and this was
              called
              Christian Communion, which is
              now most commonly
              restrained
              to acts
              of Worship, or to the Communion of the Lord's Supper.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore there were
              several Degrees
              of Christian Communion, which signified
              the several Rights
              and Priviledges,
              which some men
              enjoyed
              in the Christian Society; such as the
              <hi>Communio
              Ecclesiastica,</hi> which signified
              the Communion of the Clergy, or that Right, and
              Priviledge,
              and Authority, which they had,
              which differed
              according
              to their several Orders,
              of Bishops,
              Presbyters,
              and Deacons;
              and therefore
              when any of them
              had
              been
              guilty of such Sins
              as made
              them
              unworthy of so holy a Function, they
              were
              degraded,
              and thrust down into the state of
              Lay-men,
              but not into the State of Penitents,
              as Lay-men
              were,
              when they
            
            sinned;
              and in this Sense it is
              certainly
              true, what a late Author has
              observed,
            
            
            
            <hi>Quis unquam clericum lapsum paenitentem vidit?</hi>
              that, according
              to the ancient Discipline of the Church, (to which, no doubt
              St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> had
              respect, in that Passage which is
              cited
              from him,
              without either
              book or page) no man ever saw
              a Clergy-man in the state of Penitents;
              not as he or his Author expound these
              words,
              that no Clergy-man who was
              fallen
              into Sin, ever proved
              a Penitent;
              that is,
              did
              ever repent of his Sins,
              which are two very different things.

            Thus that Right which Lay-men
              had
              of Communion in the Christian Church or Society,
              was
              called
              <hi>Communio laica,</hi> or Lay-Communion, which
              consisted
              in the Communion of Prayers
              and Sacraments,
              <hi>c.</hi> which they were
              deprived
              of, when they lived
              unworthy of this Communion, either
              wholly
              or in part, by Excommunication, or other
              milder
              Censures:
              but this is
              sufficient to let you understand, what the
              Ancients
              meant
              by Christian Communion, which in a large Notion,
              signifies
              the Christian
              Church or Society, which is
              called
              Communion from the Communication which all the
              Members
              of it had
              with
            
            
            each other. And hence we easily
              learn, what it is
              to live in the Communion of the Church; <hi>viz.</hi> to
              communicate with all the Members
              of the Church, in all the Duties,
              for the sake of which, that Society
              was
              instituted,
              such especially
              as hearing
              the Word read or preached,
              Prayers
              and Praises,
              and Sacraments,
              and Discipline; for it is
              contrary to the very notion of Christian Communion, not to
              communicate, and excommunication,
              being
              nothing else but the shutting
              men
              out of such Societies,
              and denying
              them
              the Liberty and Priviledge
              of communicating
              with Christians,
              Communion
              must signifie
              actual communicating.
          </p>
          <p>Now, that Christian Unity does
            consist in
            Christian Communion, and is
            a Catholick
            Communion, as well as Catholick
            Unity, appears
            to me so plain and evident, both from the
            Precepts
            and Historical Accounts
            of the Apostolick
            Churches
            in Scripture, and from the best and most ancient
            records
            of the Primitive
            Church, that I confess, I wonder
            it has
            admitted
            of any dispute amongst
            learned
            men.</p>
          <p>
            That the Church of Christ is
              one, that
            
            
            
            Christ hath
              but <hi>one Body, which is
              his Church,</hi> is
              so expressly
              affirmed
              in Scripture,
              that all men
              must acknowledge it in one sense or other; for it
              is
              plain, that this was
              the design of our Saviour, in the Institution of a Church,
              that all his Disciples
              should be one. For, this our Saviour
              prays,
              17 <hi>John</hi> 11. 20, 21. <hi>Holy Father, keep, through
              thy name, those whom
              thou hast
              given
              me, that they may be one as we are. Neither pray I for these
              alone, but for them
              also, which shall believe on me, through their Word, that
              they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in
              thee,
              that they also may be one in us; that the World may believe,
              that thou sent
              me, and the Glory wbich thou gavest
              me, I have given
              to them,
              that they may be one even as we are one, I in
              them,
              and thou in me, that they may be
              made
              perfect in one, and that the World may know, that thou
              hast
              sent
              me, and hast
              loved
              them,
              as thou hast
              loved
              me.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            But then all such Expressions
              are commonly
              expounded
              of an
              Unity of Faith, or Unity of Love, and Charity, and Peace,
              not of one Communion, that is
              not of the Unity of a Church or Body, or Christian Society:
              the Unity of
            
            
            Faith, and Love, and Charity, and Peace, are indeed
              essential parts
              of Christian Unity, but do not signifie
              the whole of it. The Unity of Christians
              consists
              in the Unity of a Body and Society
              of men,
              which necessarily
              supposes
              the same Faith, and a mutual Love and Charity, as the
              Bonds
              and Ligaments
              of such an
              Union, but their Union
              consists
              in their being
              incorporated
              into one Society. The Members
              of a Body cannot be united
              without Nerves
              and Sinews,
              and other Ligaments
              which tye
              them
              together, and make a Communication
              of Life and Spirits,
              from one part and member to another; but let a Body have
              never so many Nerves
              and Sinews,
              if they do not unite the parts
              to each other, and cause a Communication
              of Life to the whole, it is
              not one body; thus, how orthodox
              soever private
              Christians
              are in their Faith, whatever their Love and
              Charity be, if
              the same Faith and a mutual Love do not unite
              them
              into one Communion,
              they have not the Unity of a Body, nor of a Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that the case is
              plainly
              this, when our Saviour and his Apostles
              speak of
            
            
            
            the Unity of Faith, and Love, and Charity, they include the
              Unity of Communion too, which ought
              naturally
              to follow from them;
              or else, when they speak of the Unity of the Church, and of
              a Body, they mean something more by it, than the
              meer
              Unity of Faith and Charity, because it
              is
              possible, that men
              who believe the same things,
              and love one another, should not be
              Members
              of the same Body and Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, to consider these things
              a little more particularly;
              The Unity of Faith must be acknowledged,
              as absolutely
              necessary to the Unity of Christians,
              for Hereticks
              are no Members
              of the Christian Church; and therefore we are
              commanded
              by the Apostle, <hi>To withdraw</hi>
            
            <hi>our selves
              from those who teach otherwise,
              and consent not to wholsome
              words,
              even the words
              of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the Doctrine, which
              is
              according
              to Godliness.</hi> For it is
              impossible, that those who differ in any material
              Article of
              Faith, should unite into one Body;
              and it is
              as unaccountable, that those who agree in the same Faith,
              should separate from each other in
              acts
              of Worship.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            And yet this very often happens,
              as the Experience of the present and
              former
              Ages
              too plainly
              proves,
              and when the same Faith cannot unite
              men
              into
            
            one Body, it cannot make them
              Members
              of the same Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              indeed
              tells
              his <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
              That they <hi>are built
              upon the Foundation of the Apostles,
              and Prophets,
              Jesus Christ himself being
              the chief Corner-stone;</hi> but he
              adds,
              <hi>In whom
              the whole building, fitly
              framed
              together,
              groweth
              into an
              holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Their
              being
              <hi>built
              upon the Foundation
              of the Apostles
              and Prophets</hi>
              signifies,
              that the Unity of Faith is
              the Foundation of this spiritual Building, but then there
              is
              somewhat more required
              to a Building, than merely
              a Foundation,
            
            
            
            <hi>they grow up into a holy Temple;</hi> and therefore
              those, who do not grow up into one Temple, but into distinct
              and Separate Churches,
              whatever Union
              they may have as to the Foundation,
              do not grow up into one Building, or one Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
              <hi>Ephesians</hi>
              supposes,
              that men
              may have one Faith, and yet not live in the Unity of the
              Church, when he perswades
              them
              to <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of</hi>
            
            <hi>Peace,</hi> by this very Argument, because there
              is
              <hi>one Faith;</hi> for, if <hi>the Unity of the Spirit in
              the bond of Peace</hi> signifies
              no more than the Unity of Faith, it
              is
              an
              odd way of arguing,
              to perswade
              them
              to unity of Faith, because they have one Faith, for so
              <hi>one Faith</hi> must signifie
              here their believing
              the same things,
              and professing
              the same Faith, if it have any force at all. Many
              Schisms
              have been
              occasioned
              by Heresies,
              and there have been
              many Schisms
              without them,
              while the Rule of Faith has
              otherwise been
              preserved
              intire.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <hi>Novatians</hi>
              and the <hi>Donatists</hi>
              both separated
              from the Catholick
              Church, under a pretence of a more strict and severe
              Discipline, while one
            
            
            would not communicate with those who fell in the
              times
              of Persecution, and defiled
              themselves with Pagan Idolatries,
              nor the other with the Traditors:
              but tho they set up new Churches,
              they professed
              the same
            
            Faith still; and <hi>Montanus</hi> his
              Heresie,
              at least, in the beginning,
              and as far as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
              was
              a Favourer of it, was
              not a Controversie
              of Faith, but of Discipline;
              and of their stationary Fasts;
              and
            
            <hi>Ruffinus</hi> observes,
              concerning
              the Schism in the Church of <hi>Antioch, that when</hi>
              Meletius <hi>was
              dead, and</hi> Flavianus <hi>put in his room,</hi> Paulinus
              <hi>being
              yet alive, who had
              alwayes
              continued
              in the Catholick
              Unity, there arose great Quarrels
              and Controversies
              among them,
              when there was
              no apparent and visible disagreement in
              matters
              of Faith; and that thus it was
              in many other Eastern Cities,
              through the contentions
              and emulations
              of their Clergy.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nay, this Notion of Catholick
              Communion,
              was
              universally
              owned
              in the Ancient Church by all sorts
              of men,
            
            
            
            even the greatest
              and most notorious Schismaticks;
              The Schism of the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              and <hi>Donatists</hi>
              did
              necessarily
              suppose this as
              the foundation of their Schism: for they
              asserted,
              That whoever
              did
              communicate with the lapsed,
              or the Traditors,
              did
              defile themselves by such a sinful Communion, and
              were
              no better than lapsed
              and Traditors
              themselves; and therefore, since the
              Catholick
              Church did
              communicate with <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
              whom
              the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              accused
              of communicating
              with the lapsed,
              and with <hi>Caecilianus,</hi>
              Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom
              the <hi>Donatists</hi>
              accused
              of being
              ordained
              by a Traditor, they renounced
              the Communion
              of the whole Catholick
              Church, which had
              been
              as foolish, as it was
              wicked, had
              they denied
              the necessity of Catholick
              Communion; for Independent
              Churches
              cannot be polluted
              with each others miscarriages.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was
              the only Argument wherewith the Ancient
              Fathers
              opposed
              those growing
              Schisms,
              that there is
              but one Christian Church, and one Christian Communion all
              the World over, and therefore, whoever
              did
              not live in the Communion of that one
            
            
            Church, and communicate with it in all Christian
              Offices
              and Duties,
              was
              out of the Church, was
              guilty of a sinful
              Separation from the Body of Christ, how Orthodox soever
              their Faith was;
              for they had
              no other way to oppose these Schisms,
              but by asserting
              the evil of such Separate Communions:
              for neither the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              nor the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              were
              ever accused
              of any other Heresies
              in Matters
              of Faith, but what concerned
              their Schism; they owned
              the Ancient Creed, and retained
              the Order of Bishops,
              (for which reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              brands
              them
              with that infamous name of <hi>Prelatical
              Donatists;</hi>
              for I confess,
              there could not well be any Presbyterian
              or Independent <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              before there were
              any Presbyterians
              and Independents
              in the World) and pretended
              to greater
              severity in the Exercise of Discipline, than the
              Catholick
              Church did,
              which was
              the reason of their Schism; very agreeable to the
              pretences
              of our present <hi>Dissenters:</hi>
              and tho St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> condemns
              and rejects
              <hi>Novatianus</hi>
              for this reason also, that he was
              ordained
            
            Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius</hi>
              was
              regularly
              and canonically
              elected
              and ordained
              Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
            
            
            
            before him;
              and since no City could have two
              Bishops
              at a time, according
              to the Ancient Practise and Canons
              of the Church, therefore the second
              Bishop could be
              no Bishop, his Ordination being
              null and void,
            
            yet St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself
              does
              not lay the great stress of the
              Controversie
              upon this, but
              asserts,
              that tho <hi>Novatianus</hi> had
              been
              first ordained,
              he had
              not been
              a Bishop, because he did
              not continue in the Unity of the Church: for we have
              Examples
              in Ecclesiastical Story of two Bishops
              at the same time in the same See, and yet this
              was
              never thought Schismatical, when the second
              was
              advanced
              by the consent of the first. Thus <hi>Alexander,</hi> a
              Bishop in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
              was
              made
              Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> while <hi>Narcissus</hi>
              was
              living,
              but very
            
            old; and <hi>Anatolius</hi> at the same time sate in the
              Church of <hi>Caesarea</hi> with <hi>Theoternus:</hi> and
              this was
              St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s
            
            own case, who was
              made
              Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> while there
              was
              another Bishop
              living;
              though he pleads
              ignorance in
              the excuse of it, that he did
            
            
            not then know of any Canon which
              forbad
              it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the Schism of <hi>Novatianus</hi>
              consisted
              in his opposing
              himself against his Bishop, and
              separating
              from the Communion
              of the Catholick
              Church, and setting
              up a new Altar, and new Church of his own,
            
            which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls,
              <hi>erecting
              a prosane Altar, and placing
              an
              adulterate Chair, and offering
              sacrilegious Sacrifices
              in opposition
              to the true Bishop;</hi> and
            
            therefore he is
              so far from owning
              him
              to be a Bishop, that he denies
              him
              to be a Christian, because he is
              not in the Church: but is
              an
              adulterate
              and opposite Head, out of the Church. And
              therefore,
              in his Book <hi>de Unitate Ecclesiae,</hi> which
              was
              purposely
              writ in confutation
              of the <hi>Novatian Schism,</hi> his whole Design
              is
              to prove, that there is
              but one Church, and that it is
              absolutely
              necessary to preserve the Unity of this Church by one
              Communion.
          </p>
          <p>
            For, if the Independency of Churches
              had
              been
              known
              in those dayes,
              what fault could the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              or <hi>Donatists</hi>
            
            
            
            have been
              charged
              with, for setting
              up distinct and separate Churches,
              only, as they pretended,
              for the sake of a more pure Communion? for they are
              charged
              with Schism only upon account
              of a causless
              Separation, which had
              been
              a very wild charge, had
              all Churches,
              by the Institution of Christ, been
              Independent, distinct and separate
              Communions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor do I see how it is
              possible to prove the necessity of Communion with any one
              particular Church, without acknowledging
              the necessity of Communion
              with the Catholick
              and Universal Church; for when the Unity of the Church
              is
              once broke
              and divided,
              I can see no end of it, but that
              men
              may divide into as many separate
              Churches
              and Communions
              as they please. Nothing
              can make Separation a Sin, but an
              obligation to preserve the Unity of the Church; but if the
              Church Universal
              be not one, there can be no obligation
              to preserve its
              Unity; there may then be ten thousand separate
              Communions
              as well as two, and every man may communicate with what
              Church he pleases,
              and when he pleases;
              if he can perswade
              any to joyn
              with him,
            
            
            he may set up a new Church, and new Communion of his own,
              and no hurt done
              neither, if they continue in the Unity of the Faith.
          </p>
          <p>And yet St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in
            disputing
            against the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
            takes
            the same Method, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            had
            done
            before him
            in disputing
            with the <hi>Novatians,</hi>
            as appears
            from his Book of the <hi>Unity of the Church,</hi> in answer
            to the Letter of <hi>Petilian</hi>
            the <hi>Donatist,</hi> and several other
            Treatises;
            as his Answer to <hi>Parmenianus,</hi>
            and the Letters
            of <hi>Petilian,</hi> and <hi>Cresconius.</hi></p>
          <p>
            In his Book of the <hi>Unity of the Church,</hi> he
              tells
              us, that the whole Controversie
              depends
              upon the answering
              this Question,
            
            where the Church is,
              whether with us
              or with them
              (the <hi>Donatists?)</hi>
              for the Church is
              but one, and therefore was
              called
              Catholick
              by our Ancestors,
              that the very name might inform us, that it
              is
              Universal, in all Parts
              of the World. And therefore,
              the onely
              Argument St. <hi>Austin</hi> uses
              to obtain this Cause, is
              to prove, that the Church of Christ
              is
              but one, dispersed
              through all the World: and
            
            
            
            therefore those, who communicate with the Universal Church,
              have the true Church; those who communicate only with the
              Sect and Party of <hi>Donatus,</hi> which
              is
              shut up within the narrow bounds
              of <hi>Africa,</hi> are out of the Church: and to make good
              this, produces
              variety of
              Testimonies
              from the Old and New Testament, to prove, that the true
              Church of Christ is
              Catholick
              and Universal, and therefore the Sect of <hi>Donatus,</hi>
              which did
              not communicate with the Church of Christ,
              is
              no true Church: Now, whether this Argument be true or false,
              it shews
              what sense St. <hi>Austin</hi> had
              of the Catholick
              Church, and the necessity of Catholick
              Communion;
              for otherwise, the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              who professed
              the Catholick
              Faith, might be Members
              of the Catholick
              Church, as well as their Adversaries,
              if Catholick
              Communion, as well as a Catholick
              Faith, were
              not necessary to that end,
          </p>
          <p>
            I readily
              grant, the Ancient Fathers
              speak much of the Unity of the Faith, as essential to
              Christian Unity, not as if this alone
              were
              sufficient to make a Church one and
              Catholick;
              for it is
              plain, it was
              not thought sufficient in
            
            
            the case of the <hi>Novations</hi>
              and <hi>Donatists,</hi>
            
            but because the Unity of Faith is
              the firmest
              Bond and Cement of Christian Communion; * that <hi>Faith
              is
              that Virtue which unites
              the Church;</hi> not that it always
              does
              so, but it cannot be done
              without it.
          </p>
          <p>But, though Faith alone is
            not sufficient
            to Christian Unity, yet Faith, in combination with those other
            Graces
            of Love, and Charity, and Peace,
            makes
            a firm and lasting
            Union. This I readily
            grant, but yet must add this one thing, that Christian Love,
            and Charity, and
            Peace, in the Language of the New Testament, and of the
            ancient Fathers,
            when they signifie
            Christian Unity,
            signifie
            also one Communion; that is,
            the Unity of a Body and Society, which
            is
            external and visible, and does
            not only signifie
            the Union of Souls
            and Affections,
            but the Union of an
            external and
            visible Communion.</p>
          <p>As for Love and Charity, I need not tell you how
            frequently
            this duty is
            inculcated
            upon all Christians:
            our only Inquiry is,
            what this signifies;
            and to determine that, let us briefly
            consider some few places,
            where we find it mentioned,
            and very earnestly
            recommended
            to us.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            Our Saviour makes
              this a Badge and
            
            Character of our Discipleship; <hi>A new Commandment I give
              unto you, that ye love one another, as I have
              loved
              you, that ye love one another; by this shall all
              men
              know, that ye are my Disciples,
              if ye have love one to another. We must love one another as
              Christ loved
              us.</hi> How is
              that? Under what Notion did
              Christ love us? This Question St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              answers,
              <hi>Husbands</hi>
            
            <hi>love your Wives,
              even as Christ loved
              the Church, and gave
              himself for it. For no</hi>
            
            <hi>man ever yet hated
              his own Flesh, but nourisheth
              and cherisheth
              it, even as the Lord the Church, for we are
              Members
              of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his
              Bones.</hi>
              Christ's Love then to us, is
              included
              in his Love to the Church, which
              is
              his Body, and his Love to us in particular,
              considers
              us, as Members
              of his Body, for he is
              only <hi>the Saviour of the Body,</hi>
            
            and therefore if we must love one
              another, as
              Christ hath
              loved
              us, we must love one another as
              Members
              of the same Body, that is,
              must live in Christian Communion and Fellowship with each
              other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus Christian Love and Charity must be such a Love, as
              is
              visible to all men,
              and may distinguish Christians
            
            
            from all other Sects
              and Professions
              of men.
              <hi>By this shall all men
              know, that you are my Disciples,
              if you have Love one to another.</hi> Now nothing can do
              this, but that Christianity which
              unites
              all Christians
              into one Communion; for, those who refuse to worship God
              together, can never be known
              to be the Disciples
              of the same Master, unless you can
              perswade
              the World to believe, that Christ
              instituted
              as many several ways
              of Worship, as
              there are Schisms
              and Divisions
              in the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            And whatever other mutual Kindness and
              Respects
              they may pay to each other, this
              is
              no peculiar Sign of their being
              Christ's Disciples;
              for the Laws
              of our Religion require us to be kind and friendly, and to
              do all good Offices
              for all men,
              to love even our Enemies,
              and those who hate us. And there are some who are not
              Christians,
              who do so excell
              in all external Civilities,
              Affability, and Curtesie,
              that if this were
              the peculiar Badge of Christianity, they might pass for
              Christians,
              without believing
              in Christ; and we see Heathens
              and Publicans,
              and the vilest
              Sinners,
              love one another, and therefore it cannot be the bare
              loving
              one another, which makes
            
            
            
            men
              Christians,
              but loving
              one another in the Communion of the Christian Church. And
              that this is
              true Christian
              Charity, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches
              us; <hi>That there should be no Schism in the Body, but</hi>
            
            <hi>that the Members
              should have the same Care one for another, and whether one
              Member suffer, all the Members
              suffer with it, or one Member be
              honoured,
              all the Members
              rejoyce
              with it; now ye are the Body of Christ, and
              Members
              in particular.</hi> This is
              to love one another, to love like
              Members
              of the same Body, to preserve the Body from all
              Rents
              and Schisms,
              and to maintain Christian Sympathy and Charity in the
              Communion of Christ's Body, whereof we are all
              Members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in another place, the same Apostle
              represents
              Christian Love, as the necessary cause and effect of
              Christian
              Unity. <hi>Speaking
              the Truth in Love, may grow up into
              him
              in all things
              which</hi>
            
            <hi>is
              the Head, even Christ, from whom
              the whole Body fitly
              joyned
              together, and compacted
              by that, which every Joynt
              supplieth,
              according
              to the effectual working
              in the measure of every part, maketh
              increase of the Body, to the edifying
              of it self in Love;</hi> so that Christian Charity
              unites
              us to Christ's Body, and by Charity the
            
            
            Christian Church is
              more firmly
              knit together,
              and is
              edified
              in all Christian Graces
              and Virtues,
              and grows
              up into a holy Temple in the Lord; and
              nothing
              is
              Christian Love and Charity, which
              does
              not unite us in one Body.
          </p>
          <p>And this was
            plainly
            the Sense of the ancient Church also,
            concerning
            Christian
            Charity, that it united
            men
            into one Body and Communion, and that there
            was
            no true Christian Charity out of the Church.</p>
          <p>
            Thus <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> a true
              Apostolical
              Bishop, in that Epistle which he
              wrote
              to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the name of the Church
              of <hi>Rome,</hi> to compose
              those Schisms
              and Divisions
              which had
              broke
              out afresh among them,
              uses
              only this one Argument to asswage
              their Passions,
              and to reduce them
              to a more peaceable and governable Temper; he very
              highly
              commends
              Charity, and condemns
              Wrath and Strife, and Envyings,
              and Emulations,
              and bitter Zeal, as very hateful to God and Christ, and very
              unworthy of a Christian man: and among other
              things
              he tells
              them,
              that
            
            <hi>Love and Charity will cause no Schism, it
              is
              not tumultuous and factious, but
              does
            
            
            
            all things
              in Agreement and Concord.</hi> And if true Christian Charity
              be inconsistent with Schism, there can be no true
              Charity out of
              the Communion of the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much to the same Purpose, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              discourses,
              in his book of the <hi>Unity of the Church;</hi>
            
            <hi>What Unity what Love doth that man keep and preserve, or
              so much as once think of, who being
              enraged,
              and almost distracted
              with furious
              Discords
              and Contentions,
              divides
              the Church, destroys
              the Faith, disturbs
              the Peace, violates
              Charity, profanes
              the Sacrament?</hi>
              And therefore this Christian Charity
              is
              by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> called
              <hi>Concordia
              coherens, Such Concord and Agreement as
              makes
              men
              stick close together;</hi> and by St. <hi>Austin, Unitatis
              Charitas,</hi> or the Charity
              of Unity, which unites
              them
              into one body.
            
            And therefore <hi>Optatus</hi> would not allow those
              <hi>Donatists</hi>
              to be Martyrs,
              who suffered
              for their Schism, because there can
            
            
            be no Martyrdom without Charity, which, it
              is
              plain, Schismaticks
              cannot have.
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus all those passages
              of the Fathers
              are to be understood,
              which speak of Christians
              <hi>being
              united
              in Love, and knit together in the bond of Union and Charity,
              as the Members
              of the Body of Christ;</hi> that
              is,
              that Charity unites
              them
              into one Christian Communion; not that it
              is
              sufficient to be united
              in Charity,
              without being
              united
              in one Body and Christian Society.
              Men
              may love one another very well, and yet not be
              Subjects
              of the same Prince, nor Members
              of the same City or Corporation,
              much less belong to the same Houshold
              and Family; but we are not Christians,
              unless we are Members
              of the Body of Christ; and therefore,
              nothing
              is
              Christian Charity, which does
              not invite us into one Body, as
              Christian
              Charity always
              does;
              as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
            
            tells
              us, that <hi>by the bond of Charity we are
              incorporated
              into that Building which is
              founded
              on a rock,</hi> that is,
              the Christian
              Church: for, that Treatise of <hi>Unity</hi>
              being
              written
              designedly
              against the Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              in answer to the Letter of <hi>Petilian,</hi> he can mean
            
            
            
            nothing else by being
              incorporated
              into that Building
              which is
              founded
              on a rock, by Charity, but being
              incorporated
              into the visible Communion of the Christian Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christian Charity is
              the same thing with what, in other
              places
              of Scripture,
            
            is
              called
              <hi>Brotherly love,</hi> and <hi>loving
              like Brethren;</hi> now this name <hi>Brethren</hi>
              was
              given
              to none, even in the Apostles
              dayes,
              but to those only who lived
              in the Communion of the Church; and this
              was
              religiously
              observed
              in the Primitive Church, where the Christian Brotherhood
              was
              confined
              to the Communion
              of the Church, and neither Hereticks,
              nor Schismaticks,
              nor excommunicated
              Persons,
              nor those who were
              under Penance, nor the Catechumens,
              which were
              not yet baptized,
              were
              called
              Brethren, by the <hi>Fideles,</hi> or those
              Christians
              who were
              in full Communion, as <hi>Albaspin</hi>
              has
              observed;
            
            and therefore those Evangelical
              Precepts
              of Brotherly Love supposes
              Christians
              to be Members
              of the same Communion,
              and cannot reach further than Christian Communion
              does.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us, in the next place consider, what
              is
              meant
              by <hi>Peace,</hi> which Christians
            
            
            are so frequently
              exhorted
              to, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              calls
              <hi>the bond of peace;</hi>
            
            now this also signifies
              the external and visible Communion of the Christian Church.
              Thus Christ is
              called
              <hi>our</hi>
            
            <hi>Peace,</hi> because he has
              united
              Jews
              and Gentiles
              into one Body or one Church. Thus the Apostle
              tells
              us, that <hi>God is</hi>
            
            <hi>not the Author of confusion but of Peace, as in all the
              Churches
              of the Saints:</hi>
              where <hi>peace</hi> being
              opposed
              to <hi>confusion,</hi> () must
              necessarily
              signifie
              the peaceable Communion of the Church, where all
              things
              are done
              decently
              and in order; and thus <hi>peace</hi>
              seems
              to signifie
              in that Apostolical Salutation,
              which is
              usually
              prefix'd to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
              Epistles,
              <hi>Grace be with you, and Peace from God the Father, and
              from our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> for, whatever some
              men
              may talk, it is
              absolutely
              impossible
              to maintain Christian Peace, when
              Christians
              divide from each other into separate
              Churches
              and Communions;
              for their very Separation signifies
              an
              aversion to each other; and while some are zealous to
              preserve the Unity of the Church, as all good
              Christians
              must be, and others are zealous to
              promote their
              Separation, as Schismaticks
            
            
            
            alwayes
              are, what hope is
              there of Peace and Concord in the midst of
              Disputes
              and fierce oppositions?
              there never was
              a Schism yet, but what disturbed
              the Peace, as well as broke
              the Unity of the Church; and, I shall not
              easily
              believe it can be, till I see some instance wherein it
              is
              so, and that I fear I shall never see in this Age; and
              therefore, in the mean time, if we will own it our Duty to
              preserve the Peace of the Church, we must acknowledge it our
              Duty to live in the Communion of the Church.

          <p>
            To be sure this was
              very agreeable to the Language of the Ancient Church; for,
              in the Writings
              of the Ancient Fathers
              and Councils,
              nothing is
              more familiar than by the <hi>Peace of the Church,</hi> to
              understand <hi>the Communion of the Church.</hi> Thus, when
              men
              were
              under Excommunications
              and Censures,
              they were
              said
              to <hi>desire Peace,</hi> to <hi>receive Peace,</hi> and the
              Bishop <hi>to give them
              the Peace of the Church,</hi> when they
              were
              restored
              to Christian Communion; and to <hi>dye
              in peace,</hi> signified
              to dye
              in the Communion of the Church: and the <hi>osculum
              pacis,</hi> the <hi>kiss of Peace,</hi> which
            
            St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls
              the <hi>holy kiss,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter
            
            
            a kiss of Charity,</hi> is
              by St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> as he
            
            is
              cited
              by <hi>Albaspinus,</hi> made
              a Symbol and Representation, not only of the union of
              Affections,
              of Love, and Charity,
              but of the Unity of an
              external and visible Communion.
          </p>
          <p>But, for the farther confirmation of this, <hi>That
            Catholick
            Unity does
            consist in Catholick
            Communion,</hi> let us briefly
            consider the
            Nature and Use of the Christian
            Sacraments,
            which are the great and firmest
            bonds
            of Christian Union: and they are these two: <hi>Baptism</hi>
            and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi></p>
          <p>
            As for <hi>Baptism,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              tells
              us, that there is
              but one <hi>Baptism,</hi> as there
              is
              but <hi>one Body,</hi> and <hi>one Spirit,</hi> and that
              <hi>by this</hi>
            
            <hi>one Spirit,</hi> which is
              bestowed
              at Baptism,
              <hi>we are all baptized
              into one Body, whether we be Jews
              or Gentiles,
              whether we be bond or free.</hi> Baptism
              makes
              us Members
              of the Catholick
              and Universal
              Church; for we are not baptized
              into any particular Church, as, suppose the Church of
              <hi>England,</hi> or the Church of <hi>France,</hi> or
              <hi>Holland,</hi> but are made
              Catholick
              Christians,
              that is,
              Members
              of the Universal Church, and have a right to Christian
              Communion in all true Churches
              in the World, which
            
            
            
            cannot possibly
              be, unless we acknowledge,
              that there is
              but one Church, one Body and Society of
              Christians
              all the World over, which are bound
              to live in Communion with each other.
          </p>
          <p>For Independent Churches
            are like some little Independent
            Commonwealths,
            which have no commerce or intercourse with each other, at
            least, by being
            Members
            of one Commonwealth, they are not
            incorporated
            into the Neighbour Commonwealths,
            nor can challenge any priviledge
            in them
            but upon courtesie.</p>
          <p>
            Now, I would desire to know, if
              Independent
              Churches,
              consisting
              of single
              Congregations,
              be the only Churches
              of Christ's Institution, whether
              Baptism be our
              Admission into the Christian
              Church, or not? if it be not, I would desire to know what it
              signifies,
              and in what sense we are said
              to be <hi>baptized
              into one body?</hi> if it be, I would
              enquire
              farther what this admission into the Church by Baptism
              signifies?
              whether a right and obligation to external and visible
              Communion in all Religious Duties
              and Offices,
              that is,
              whether Baptism makes
              us such Church-members
              as are bound
              to joyn
              in the Worship of
            
            
            God, and our common Saviour? <hi>c.</hi> if it
              does
              not, I would desire them
              to tell me, how men
              can be admitted,
              into the Christian Church, and yet not be
              made
              Church-members,
              when Excommunication,
              which shuts
              them
              out of the Church, is
              no more than debarring
              them
              the Priviledges
              of Christian Communion,
              which, it seems,
              according
              to these Principles,
              those who are admitted
              into the Church by Baptism, have no right to, and therefore
              are not in a much better condition than the
              Excommunicate?
              if it does,
              I would enquire
              farther, what Church-baptism makes
              us Members
              of? the Independents
              will not allow that it makes
              any man a Member of an
              Independent Congregational
              Church, for that is
              done
              by a Church-Covenant; nor will they
              allow, that
              there are any other Churches
              of Divine Institution, but onely
              Congregational Churches,
              and therefore
              Baptism makes
              men
              Members
              of no Church. For, to say that Baptism
              makes
              men
              Members
              of no particular Church, and yet
              makes
              them
              Members
              of the Universal Church, if the
              Universal
              Church be nothing else but a great number of particular
              Independent
            
            
            
            Churches,
              is
              as absurd, as it is
              to say, that a man may be born into the World, and not yet
              born into any part of the World.
          </p>
          <p>But the Apostles
            and the Ancient Fathers
            alwayes
            acknowledged
            but one Baptism, and that for this reason,
            because there
            is
            but one Church, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>
            joyns
            one Baptism with one Body; for Baptism
            makes
            us Members
            of one Body, and one Church, which
            is
            dispersed
            all the World over, and in what particular Church soever any
            man is
            baptized,
            unless he afterwards
            forfeit his Right by Heresie
            or a wicked Life, he is
            a Christian all the World over, and
            has
            a Right to Christian
            Communion in all Churches.</p>
          <p>We may easily
            understand the sense of the Ancient Church in this matter,
            from that hot Dispute about Re-baptizing,
            or rather about the baptizing
            those who were
            baptized
            by Hereticks;
            for both Parties
            were
            agreed
            upon this point, that there was
            but one Church and one Baptism, which
            made
            them
            Members
            of that one Church, and that it
            was
            unlawful to re-baptize
            any one who had
            been
            once baptized.</p>
          
          
          <p>
            St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi>
              Bishops,
              rejected
              the Baptism of Hereticks,
              because there
              is
              <hi>but one Baptism in the</hi>
            
            <hi>Church, and no Baptism out of the Church.</hi> And it
              is
              impossible to divide the Church and Baptism, as we find at
              large in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and in St.
              <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epistles
              to <hi>Quintus, Jubaianus,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of
              <hi>Rome,</hi> and those Bishops
              who joyned
              with him,
              and some time after, St. <hi>Austin</hi>
              and <hi>Optatus,</hi> and those who writ against the
              <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              and condemned
              their practise of Re-baptizing
              those who were
              baptized
              in the Catholick
              Church, would not condemn even the Baptism of
              Hereticks,
              (while it was
              administred
              in that solemn form of words,
              which our Saviour appointed,
              <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
              Holy Ghost)</hi> for this very Reason,
              because there
              was
              but one Baptism in the Christian Church, which
              implanted
              us into the one Body of Christ, and
              received
              it's Virtue and Efficacy, not from the Worthiness of the
              Minister who
            
            
            
            baptized,
              but from a divine Institution.
          </p>
          <p>I will not undertake to decide this
            Controversie,
            but only observe, that though they
            drew
            very different Consequences,
            yet they argued
            from the same Premises,
            and all agreed,
            that there was
            but one Baptism, because there was
            but one Church. And if we will allow, as they all
            granted,
            that Baptism made
            us visible Members
            of the Church of Christ, and gave
            us Right to visible Communion, the Unity of Baptism
            proves,
            not only that there is
            but one Church, but that there is
            but one Communion
            in the Catholick
            Church.</p>
          <p>
            And it is
              observable, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              assigns
              this as the Reason, why <hi>Novatianus</hi>
              rebaptized
              those who came
              over to
            
            his Party and Faction, because he could not appropriate the
              Church without appropriating
              Baptism to himself. <hi>Novatianus</hi>
              (says
              he) <hi>after the manner of Apes,
              who imitate men,
              though they are not men,
              challenges
              the Authority and Truth of the Catholick
              Church, to himself, when he is
              so
            
            
            far from being
              in the Church, that he is
              a profest
              Enemy and Rebel against it: for,
              knowing
              that there is
              but one Baptism, he challenges
              this one Baptism to himself, thereby to
              perswade
              the World, that his Party is
              the Church, and that we are Hereticks.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The Lord's Supper is
            another Sacrament
            of the Christian Church, and does
            so plainly
            signifie
            one Church, and one Communion, that it
            is
            impossible to understand
            the true nature of this Sacrament
            without it.</p>
          <p>
            St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives
              us an
              account of it, in
            
            these words,
              <hi>The Cup of Blessing
              which we bless, is
              it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which
              we break, is
              it not the Communion of the Body
              of Christ? For we being
              many, are one Bread and one Body, for we are all
              Partakers
              of that one Bread; behold</hi> Israel
              <hi>after the
              Flesh, are not they which eat of the
              Sacrifices,
              Partakers
              of the Altar.</hi> In which words,
              there are several things
              to be observed
              to our present Purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            As first, the Scope and Design of
              them,
              which was
              to deter Christians
              from going
              to Pagan Feasts,
              where they eat and drank
              of such things,
              as were
            
            
            
            offered
              in Sacrifice to Devils,
              and united
              themselves to those persons,
              who keep those Feasts
              in honour of those wicked Spirits,
              to whom
              they sacrificed;
              which the Apostle tells
              them,
              was
              to <hi>have Fellowship with Devils,
              by drinking</hi>
            
            <hi>the Cup, and partaking
              of the Table of Devils.</hi>
              Now the only proof we find of this, must be
              fetched
              from the Nature and Institution of the Lord's Supper, and
              the Jewish Sacrifices,
              in the words
              now cited,
              from whence the Apostle draws
              this Conclusion; and therefore, when the Apostle
              calls
              the Eucharistical Cup and Bread, <hi>The Communion of the
              Blood, and of the Body of Christ,</hi> it
              signifies,
              that we are in Fellowship with Christ, and with each other,
              with him
              as our Head, and with each other, as
              Members
              of the same Body; for otherwise,
              their eating
              and drinking
              at Pagan
              Feasts,
              could not prove, that they were
              in Fellowship with Devils
              and Idolaters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly,
              I observe, that this Eucharistical
              Feast, in how many distant places
              soever it be celebrated,
              is
              but <hi>one Bread and one Cup;</hi> for so the Apostle
              expressly
              asserts,
              that there is
              but <hi>one Bread,</hi> as there
              is
              but <hi>one Body,</hi> for the Bread
              represents
            
            
            the Body of Christ, and the Cup his Blood, and therefore
              is
              but one, as the Body of Christ is
              one.
          </p>
          <p>Thirdly,
            that this one Bread signifies
            the Union of all Christians
            in one Body, for so we are told,
            <hi>we being
            many, are one
            Bread, and one Body, for we are
            partakers
            of that one bread:</hi> that as this one bread
            signifies
            that one Body of Christ which was
            broken
            for the sins
            of the whole World, so it signifies,
            that all those who partake of this one bread, are
            united
            into one Body, whereof
            Christ is
            the Head.</p>
          <p>
            Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> understood
              these words,
              when, speaking
              of this mysterious
              Sacrament, he says,
              <hi>that it signifies
              and declares</hi>
            
            <hi>the Union of Christian
              People; for, as many grains
              put together, and ground small, and well mix'd, make one
              Bread, so we know that in Christ there
              is
              but one Body, to which our whole number
              is
              united
              and combined.</hi>
              Where we must observe, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              does
              not say, that this one Bread does
              signifie,
              that their number or company, who liv'd,
              suppose
            
            
            
            in the same Church, and actually
              communicated
              with each other, is
              one Body; but that <hi>in Christ there
              is
              but one Body,</hi> to which their number or
              Society
              is
              united,
              as is
              signified
              by their partaking
              of that one Bread: so that the <hi>one Bread</hi>
              signifies
              that <hi>one Body of Christ,</hi> which
              is
              his Universal Church, to which all
              Churches
              are united,
              as partaking
              of that one Bread.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, by the way, we may hence observe,
              how the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by her new Doctrine of
              Transubstantiation,
              destroys
              the true mystery and signification
              of this holy Feast; for, according
              to this Doctrine, every Christian
              eats
              the whole intire
              Body of Christ, which is
              in every wafer, nay, in the least part of every wafer; which
              does
              not onely
              contradict the notion of a broken
              Body, which is
              represented
              in the Sacramental bread, but spoils
              the Apostle's Argument for the Unity of the Christian
              Church, that all Chri___ns
              are <hi>one Bread and one Body;</hi> for, when ten thousand
              men,
              and as many more as you please, do each of
              them
              eat the whole Body of Christ, it
              seems
              difficult to understand how Christ
              has
              but one Body, or how this signifies
            
            
            that all Christians
              are but one Body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourthly,
              This <hi>one bread</hi> signifies
              one Communion in the Christian Church: Thus the <hi>Cup</hi>
              is
              called
              <hi>the Communion of the Blood of Christ,</hi> and the
              <hi>Bread, the Communion of the Body of Christ,</hi>
              , which signifies,
              that it is
              a common Table, and that whoever
              partake of it,
              are in Fellowship and Society
              with Christ, and with one another; for so
               signifies
              in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle, <hi>Our Fellowship
              is
              with the Father,</hi>
            
            <hi>and with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> And the Lord's
              Supper is
              peculiarly
              called
              Communion or Fellowship, because it
              does
              most aptly
              signifie
              the Communion
              of Christians
              in one Body or Society,
              of which Christ is
              the Head, and in the Union of which, he
              dispences
              all the merits
              of his Death and Passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> discourses
              at large
            
            upon those words,
              <hi>The Bread which we break, is
              it not the Communion of the Body
              of Christ? Why</hi> (sayes
              he) <hi>did
              @ the
              Apostle say, the participation</hi> (of the
            
            
            
            Body of Christ) <hi>because he intended
              to signifie
              something greater,
              and to represent a more close and intimate Union and
              Conjunction,
              for we communicate not only by partaking
              and receiving</hi>
              (the Bread) <hi>but by being
              united;
              as the Body is
              united
              to Christ, so are we united
              to him
              by the Bread.</hi> And upon those
              Words,
              <hi>for we being
              many are one Bread and one Body,</hi> he
              adds,
              that it is,
              as if the Apostle had
              corrected
              himself in this manner, <hi>Why do I speak of Communion when
              we our selves
              are that very Body? For what is
              the
            
            
            Bread? the Body of Christ; who are they that receive it? the
              Body of Christ: not many Bodies,
              but one Body: for, as the bread, which
              is
              made
              of several grains,
              is
              so mixed
              and kneaded
              together, that you can no longer
              discern the particular grains,
              but one lump and mass, thus are we
              united
              to each other, and to Christ; for thou art not
              nourished
              by one Body and he by another, but all by the same Body; and
              therefore the Apostle adds,
              For we all partake
              of that one bread; and, if we all partake of the same, we
              are all the same, and why then should we not
              shew
              the same</hi>
            
            <hi>Love to each other, that we might be all one that way
              also?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon these
            words,
            <hi>there is
            one bread,</hi> tells
            us, <hi>that the Apostle hereby
            admonishes
            the</hi> Corinthians,
            <hi>that it is
            their Duty to maintain this Unity they have in Christ by
            an
            external
            profession of it,</hi> that is,
            by an
            external and
            visible Communion; for so he adds,
            <hi>That they must all meet together
            to celebrate that Feast, which is
            a Symbol of this Sacred Unity.</hi></p>
          <p>
            And that the Apostle here does
              intend to
              signifie
              one Christian Communion,
              is
              evident from that Argument he
            
            
            
            urges,
              from the Example of <hi>Israel after the Flesh, are not they
              which eat of the Sacrifices
              Partakers
              of the Altar:</hi> that is,
              all united
              and combined
              in the Worship of that God, at whose Altar those
              Sacrifices
              were
              offered;
              for though all <hi>Israel</hi> did
              not eat of the same Sacrifices,
              yet they all offered
              their Sacrifices
              at the same Altar, which signified,
              that they were
              all the Worshippers
              of the same God, who had
              but one Altar, and that they were
              all incorporated
              into one Body,
              the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> who alone
              had
              Right to offer at that Altar. And it
              is
              very agreeable to this, what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              tells
              us of the whole Christian
              Church, that it has
              but <hi>one Altar;</hi> for when he
              had
              told
              his People to whom
              he writ, to beware of <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> who
              had
              made
              a Schism among them,
              <hi>That there is
              but one God, and one Christ, and one Church,</hi> he
              adds,
              and but <hi>one Altar and one Priest-hood,</hi> which must
              be understood
              of the Universal Church, and so
              signifies
              one Catholick
              Communion, which, by the way, quite
              spoils
              Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Argument, which he so often
              repeats,
              That a Bishoprick
              in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
              time was
              no larger
              than one single
            
            
            Congregation, because St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              asserts,
              that
            
            every Bishop had
              but <hi>one Altar,</hi> whenas he also
              asserts
              the same of the whole Christian Church, and thereby he
              means
              not one place of communicating,
              but one Communion. And for the same reason, St.
              <hi>Austin</hi> calls
              the Communion of the Donatists,
              <hi>Altare
              Schismatis,</hi> an
              Altar of Schism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The principle design indeed of the Apostle in this place,
              is
              to prove, that the using
              any religious Rites
              and Ceremonies
              (such as feasting
              upon a Sacrifice,
            
            always
              was
              accounted)
              did
              signifie
              our Communion and Fellowship with that God, whose Worship it
              is;
              and therefore,
              those who feasted
              on Pagan Sacrifices,
              had
              Fellowship with Devils.
              But his Argument proves
              something more, that all the Worshipers
              of the same God, were
              in Fellowship with one another; that as
              eating
              the Sacramental Bread does
              unite us to Christ, so it makes
              us all one Bread, and one Body, that
              is,
              one external and visible Society and Communion: for, if the
              Lord's Supper signifies
              Unity, it must signifie
              one
            
            
            
            Communion, because the very nature of it
              requires
              that it be celebrated
              in Company, which is
              the great Argument urged
              by Protestants,
              against the private
              Masses
              of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>But to proceed, as the Unity of the Christian
            Sacraments
            proves
            the Unity of Christian Communion, so also
            does
            the Unity of Church Power and Government.
            Every Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon, by his Ordination
            is
            made
            a Minister of the Catholick
            Church, though for the better Edification of the Church, the
            exercise of his Office is
            more peculiarly
            confined
            to some particular
            place. Every Bishop and Presbyter
            receives
            into the Catholick
            Church by Baptism, as I have already
            proved,
            and shuts
            out of the Catholick
            Church by Excommunication, as I shall prove hereafter, which
            they could not do, were
            they not publick
            Officers
            of the Universal Church.</p>
          <p>
            And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells
              us, that there is
              but
            
            <hi>one Episcopacy, part of which,
              every Bishop
              holds
              with full Authority and Power;</hi> and
            
            <hi>that there is
              one Episcopacy
            
            
            spread over the World, by the consenting
              Multitude of many Bishops;</hi>
              and therefore
              he calls
              it, <hi>The Unity and the Peace of the Episcopacy.</hi>
            
            Hence we read of the <hi>Collegium
              Episcopale,</hi>
              the <hi>Episcopal Colledge,</hi>
              and Bishops
              were
              called
              <hi>Collegae,</hi>
            
            <hi>Collegues,</hi>
              who were
              Members
              of the same Society, and enjoyed
              equal Honour and Power, and governed
              their Churches
              by a mutual consent, as we often read in St.
              <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who never
              (as far as I can observe) gave
              the name of <hi>Colleague</hi> to any but a Bishop: and
            
            St. <hi>Austin</hi> uses
              <hi>Collegues</hi>
              to signifie
              Bishops,
              as distinct from Presbyters,
              Deacons,
              and the inferiour
              Clergy: and
            
            St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes
              the Unity of the Church very much to
              depend upon the
              Union and Concord of Bishops,
              <hi>That the Catholick
              Church is
              not rent nor divided,
              but united
              and coupled
              by the Cement of Bishops,
              who stick close together.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And in his book of <hi>the Unity of the Church,</hi> the
              first Argument he urges
              to prove the Unity of the Church,
              is
              the
            
            
            
            Unity of the Apostolical Office, and
              assigns
              this as the Reason, why our Saviour,
              in a particular manner, committed
              the Keys
              to <hi>Peter,</hi> (when he gave
              the same Power to all the rest of the
              Apostles,
            
            which he did
              to <hi>Peter) viz.</hi> to manifest the Unity of the
              Apostolical Office and Power, that <hi>there
              is</hi>
            
            <hi>but one Chair and one original of
              Unity, which
              begins
              in one; for, the rest of the Apostles
              were
              the same that</hi> Peter <hi>was,
              had
              an
              equal share in the Honour and Power of the Apostolical
              Office; but the beginning
              is
              from Unity, and the Primacy is
              given
              to</hi> Peter,
              <hi>that it might appear that the Church of Christ
              is
              one, and the Chair one,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Apostolical
              Office and Power. They are all Pastors,
              but there is
              but one Flock, which is
              fed
              by all the Apostles
              with a joynt
              Consent.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is
              the plain Scope and Design of this passage of St.
              <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (which has
              been
              so often abused,
              especially
              by the <hi>Romanists)</hi>
              that our Saviour in
            
            
            naming
              <hi>Peter</hi> onely,
              in giving
              the Apostolical
              Power, did
              signifie,
              that the Apostolical Office, though
              exercised
              by several Persons,
              is
              but one Office and Power, which
              is
              not so properly
              divided
              among the Apostles,
              as administred
              by a joynt
              consent, and therefore, giving
              this Power to one Apostle, included
              the bestowing
              this Power on the whole Apostolical
              Colledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              says,
            
            that Christ built
              his Church upon <hi>Peter</hi> alone, he
              does
              not and cannot mean the Person of <hi>Peter,</hi> or any
              thing peculiar
              to him,
              but that Apostolical Office and Power, which
              was
              given
              to the College of the Apostles
              in the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Church
              is
              said
              to <hi>be built
              upon the foundation of the Apostles
              and Prophets.</hi>
              And when he sayes,
              that Christ gave
              the Primacy to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet at the same time
              affirms,
              that the other Apostles
              were
              equal sharers
              with him
              in Honour and Power, and were
              all that which <hi>Peter</hi> was,
              it can signifie
              no more, nor no less, than that Christ
              named
              <hi>Peter</hi> first, or rather, instead of all the
              Apostles,
              thereby to instruct them;
              that though they were
              many, yet their Office and Power
              was
              but
            
            
            
            one, which they must exercise as one man, with one consent.
          </p>
          <p>And now I cannot but wonder to find some
            Learned
            men
            very zealous Asserters
            of the Independency of Bishops,
            and to alledge
            St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Authority
            for it: for, whatever difficulty there may be in
            giving
            an
            account of every particular Saying
            in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
            certainly,
            he could never be of this Opinion, who,
            asserts
            but one Chair, and one Apostolical Office and Power, which now
            resides
            in the Bishops
            of the Universal Church; for when the same power
            is
            in ten thousand
            hands,
            it can be <hi>one</hi> onely
            by Unity of consent
            in the exercise of it; and it is
            very wild to imagine, that any one of these
            Persons,
            who abuse this Power, shall not be accountable to the rest for
            it.</p>
          <p>
            For we must consider, that all the
              Apostles
              had
              relation to the whole Church, and therefore, though
              being
              finite Creatures,
              they could not be every where at a time, but
              betook
              themselves to different places,
              and planted
              Churches
              in several Countries,
              and did
              more peculiarly
              apply themselves
              to the Government of those
            
            
            Churches,
              which they themselves had
              planted,
              and ordained
              Bishops
              to succeed
              them
              in their Care and Charge, yet their original Right and Power
              in relation to the whole Church
              did
              still remain, which they might re-assume,
              when they saw
              occasion for it, and which did
              oblige them
              to take care, as far as possibly
              they could, that the Church of Christ
              suffered
              no injury by the
              Heresie
              or evil Practises
              of any of their Collegues;
              and though Equals
              have no Superiority over one another, yet a
              Colledge
              has
              Authority and command over any of
              its
              Collegues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus <hi>Rigaltius</hi> has
              observed
              upon
            
            St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as the Learned
              Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
              has
              before noted,
              that <hi>St. Cyprian
              not doubting
              from the nature of the Unity of</hi>
            
            <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline, but the care of all
              Churches
              was
              upon him,
              dispatched
              his Letters
              to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>from whence they
              were
              sent
              through the Catholick
              Church, as an
              Evidence,
              that there was
              but one Episcopal Office in the
            
            
            
            whole Church, part of which was
              committed
              in full power to every Bishop.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>And if we consider the practise of the Ancient Church, we
            shall find, that they never thought every Bishop to be
            Independent, but as liable to the
            censures
            of their Collegues,
            as Presbyters
            and Deacons
            were
            to the Censures
            of their Bishops.</p>
          <p>It were
            easie
            to reckon up numerous Canons
            of ancient Councils,
            which suppose this Authority in the Church of
            deposing
            heretical or scandalous Bishops,
            and prescribe Rule for the regulating
            of it.</p>
          <p>
            And there are too many Examples
              in Ecclesiastical History of this Nature. The
              Bishops,
              who ordained
              <hi>Novatianus,</hi>
              were
              deposed,
              so was
              <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi>
              by the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Domnus</hi>
              substituted
              in his room.
            
            Thus <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi>
              were
              deposed,
              and <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi>
              made
              Bishops
              in their stead. The like may be
              said
              of <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and
              another of
              <hi>Sebastia,</hi> of <hi>Marcellus</hi> of
              <hi>Ancyra,</hi>
              and <hi>Photinus</hi> of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and many others:
              and we never find that those Persons
              who were
              deposed
              did
              dispute the Power and Authority of the Church
            
            
            to depose Bishops,
              but justice of the Cause, and therefore many
              times
              made
              their Appeals
              from Provincial to General Councils,
              or from one Council
              to another.
          </p>
          <p>And indeed, the Independency of
            Bishops
            is
            as inconsistent with <hi>Ecclesiastical
            Unity,</hi> which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others so often
            mention, as the Independency
            of single Congregations;
            only with this
            difference, that a Bishoprick
            is
            larger,
            and contains
            a great many
            particular Congregations
            under it, but yet the danger to the Church may be as great
            from an
            Heretical and Scandalous
            Bishop, who may infect his whole Diocese, without any
            remedy.</p>
          <p>
            And this very reason St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              gives,
              why there are so many Bishops
              in the Christan Church, whom
              he calls
              <hi>a copious body of Bishops,</hi>
            
            <hi>coupled
              by the cement of Concord and bond of
              Unity, that if
              any of our Colledge</hi>
              (i. e. any Bishop) <hi>should endeavour to broach any new
              Heresie,
              or to tear and spoil the Flock of Christ, the rest may come
              in to their help, and, like good and
              merciful
            
            
            
            Pastors,
              gather again the sheep of Christ into the fold.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>This seems
            sufficient to shew
            what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Opinion
            was
            in this matter,
            let us therefore now briefly
            enquire,
            for what reason some have thought that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            did
            assert every Bishop
            to be Independent, and accountable
            to none but Christ, and the reason
            seems
            to be a very weighty one, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            sayes
            so in express words,
            though, methinks,
            it should make men
            careful how they expounded
            such words
            to contradict his avowed
            Doctrine and
            Practise, and the practise of the Universal Church; for, if
            every Bishop be absolutely
            unaccountable to any but Christ, he cannot be
            lawfully
            deposed
            by all the visible Authority of the Church.</p>
          <p>And therefore to adjust this matter, we must
            particularly
            consider, what those cases
            are wherein every Bishop is
            at liberty to make Rules
            for himself, and govern his Church
            according
            to his own Prudence and Conscience, without
            being
            bound
            to give an
            account of his
            Actions
            to his Fellow Bishops.</p>
          
          
          <p>
            That this does
              not extend to Heresie
              or Schism, is
              evident from those Testimonies
              which I have already produced,
              for then the Church would have no power to excommunicate and
              depose Heretical or Schismatical
              Bishops,
              and the like may be said
              of any great and enormous sin, such as Idolatry, and
              renouncing
              Christianity in the time of Persecution, which
              was
              the case of <hi>Basilides</hi>
              and <hi>Martialis,</hi> two <hi>Spanish</hi>
              Bishops;
              and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does
              exhort the People to forsake the Communion of
            
            such Bishops,
              and commends
              those that did:
              Not as if he made
              the People the Judges
              of their Bishops,
              or that they were
              for every fault or miscarriage to leave their Communion, and
              set up other Bishops,
              but when they were
              guilty of such notorious Heresie,
              or wickedness, that, by the Judgment
              and Censure of Neighbour Bishops,
              or Provincial
              or General Councils,
              they were
              deposed,
              the People also should withdraw
              from them;
              for the onely
              thing upon such an
              occasion, that can make any breach in the Church,
              is,
              when the People will not forsake the
              Communion of
              such Heretical or Schismatical Bishops,
              though they be very justly
              deposed,
            
            
            
            and others ordained
              in their room. For this was
              the present case, <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi>
              were
              actually
              deposed,
              and <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi>
              actually
              ordained
              Bishops,
              when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writ to the People to avoid the
              Communion of
              those Sacrilegious Bishops:
              as, upon a like occasion, he writ to his own People of
              <hi>Carthage,</hi> to avoid <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and those
              factious Presbyters
            
            who were
              of his Party, when they were
              first excommunicated
              by <hi>Caldonius</hi>
            
            and <hi>Herculanus;</hi> which I observe by the way, that no
              man may mistake such Expressions,
              as we sometimes
              meet with in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other ancient
              Writers,
              perswading
              the People to forsake
              wicked or unsound Bishops,
              to justifie
              People in making
              a factious opposition
              to their Bishop, or upon every
              <hi>capricio,</hi> running
              into a tumultuary Schism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Heresie
              must be very notorious, and the Crime very foul and
              scandalous, which will justifie
              either Presbyters
              or People, to withdraw from their Bishop, before a judicial
              Sentence, or at least, without the Advice of some neighbour
              Bishops.
              Thus <hi>Nestorius</hi> was
              deserted
              by several of his Presbyters,
              and by
            
            
            many of the People, before he was
              condemned
              by the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
              writ a reproving
              Letter to <hi>John,</hi> Bishop of
              <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
              but it was
              after <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writ to
              them
              to beware of his Heresie,
              as being
              suspected
              of <hi>Arrianism.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            But to come closer
              to the busines
              in hand, I acknowledge St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              does
              assert, that every Bishop has
              the Liberty of
              his own choice in governing
              the Church over which he is
              Bishop; and that if he differs
              from others in some matters,
              yet he is
              not to be judged
              or
            
            deprived
              of Catholick
              Communion for it; for no one of
              them
              pretends
              to be a Bishop of Bishops,
              nor can they either judge or be
              judged
              by one another; but they must all expect the
              Judgment
              of Christ, who both gave
              them
              this Authority, and is
              the only proper Judge of their Actions.
              To this purpose
              he discourses
              in several places,
              as you may see in the Margin, and yet
              was
              far enough from owning
              an
              absolute
              Independency of Bishops,
              as will appear, if we consider these
              things.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. That he allows
              of this only in some matters
              of Discipline, and external
              Administration of Church Affairs,
            
            
            
            especially
              when the case was
              new and undetermined; for he has
              mentioned
              but two cases,
              wherein he has
              asserted
              this Liberty to every Bishop: 1. The
              reconciling
              those to the Church, and receiving
              them
              to Christian Communion,
              who had
              fallen
              in times
              of Persecution.
              And 2. Baptizing
              those when they returned
              to the Catholick
              Church, who had
              formerly
              been
              baptized
              by Hereticks,
              and he limits
              and confines
              this Power to matters
              of Discipline; <hi>That in the Government and
              Administration</hi>
            
            <hi>of Church Affairs,
              every Bishop enjoys
              the Freedom of his own Will, and
              is
              to give an
              Account of his actions
              to the Lord.</hi> And therefore he
              says,
              that <hi>in such matters
              they offer no Force, nor give Laws
              to any man.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now in such matters
              as these, especially
              when the Controversie
              is
              first started,
              the Judgments
              of very wise and good men,
              being
              different and various, and the Church
              having
              always
              allowed
              different Customs
              and Usages
              in different
              Churches,
              and having
              often altered
              the Rules
              of Discipline, as the Good
            
            
            of the Church, and the Edification of
              Christians
              required;
              and every Bishop best understanding
              the Necessities
              of his own Church, and what is
              most agreeable
              to the present state of Affairs,
              it was
              highly
              reasonable, that every Bishop should enjoy this Liberty,
              without which, he must needs
              be at a loss upon every new emergent Difficulty, which will
              not admit such Delays,
              till he can consult with all his
              Neighbours,
              much less with foreign and remote
              Bishops.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. Even in these matters,
              especially
              if there be any apparent difficulty, he
              requires
              the advice of Fellow Bishops,
              that, as near as may be, they may all
              observe the
              same Laws
              and Rules
              of Discicipline;
              and therefore, in his Epistle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> he
              tells
              him,
              that they altered
            
            nothing in the Discipline of the Church, till they
              met
              together in Council,
              and duely
              weighed
              and considered
              the case of the Lapsed,
              and what was
              the fittest
              Temperament of Severity and Mercy to be
              used
              at that time: and least it should not be thought sufficient,
              to advise only with the <hi>African</hi>
              Bishops
              in so weighty an
              Affair, they sent
              to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his
              Collegues,
              to acquaint
              them
              what they had
              done,
              and
            
            
            
            to desire their Advice and Consent, and the same Method he
              observed
              about the Controversie
              of baptizing
              Hereticks,
              which was
              fully
              and freely
              debated
              in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
              an
              Account of which, he sent
              to <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to other
              foreign Churches;
              which plainly
              shews,
              that they thought themselves obliged,
              as far as possibly
              they could, to do all things
              with mutual
              Advice and Consent.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. If it so fell out, as it often
              does
              in matters
              of mere Prudence and Order, that they
              differed
              in their Judgments
              of things,
              yet they were
              bound
              to preserve the Unity of the Church, neither to
              deny Communion to
              others, nor to forsake
              their Communion upon such accounts.
              Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells
              the Bishops,
              met
              in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> about
              baptizing
              Hereticks,
            
            <hi>That they should all speak their
              Minds
              freely,
              judging
              no man, nor denying
              Communion to him,
              if he differed
              from them
              in this matter.</hi>
              And in his Epistle to <hi>Stephen,</hi>
              Bishop of
              <hi>Rome,</hi> observes,
            
            <hi>That there are
            
            
            some, who will never lay aside those
              Opinions
              which they have once sucked
              in, nor easily
              alter what they have once resolved;
              but retain those peculiar Observances,
              which have been
              in use among them,
              though preserving
              intire
              the Bond of Peace and Concord
              with their Collegues.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And in his next Epistle to <hi>Jubaianus,</hi> he
              says,
              * <hi>He is
              resolved
              not to contend with his</hi>
            
            <hi>Collegues
              and Fellow-Bishops,
              for the sake of Hereticks,</hi>
              but if any Difference happens,
              <hi>He will patiently
              and resolutely
              preserve true Love and Charity in his mind, the Honour of
              the Colledge,
              the Bond of Faith, and the Concord of the Episcopal
              Office.</hi> Methinks
              this does
              not sound like an
              absolute Independency of Bishops.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his Epistle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> he
              tells
              him,
              <hi>That formerly
              there were
              some in his Province, who would not receive
              Adulterers
              to the Peace and Communion of the Church, nor allow
              them
              any place for Repentance,
              yet did
              not separate from the Colledge
              of their Bishops,
              nor break the Peace of the Church, through their Obstinacy
              or
            
            
            
            inflexible Severity of Discipline;</hi> and
              adds,
            
            <hi>That while the bond of Concord, and the undivided
              Sacrament of the Catholick
              Church, is
              preserved
              and maintained;
              every Bishop
              orders
              and governs
              his own Affairs,
              so as he must give an
              account to his Lord for it.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            For this Reason, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes so
            
            sharply
              against <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because
              he was
              not contented
              to enjoy his own Opinion and Practice, but
              threatned
              to excommunicate the <hi>African</hi>
              Bishops,
              who disowned
              the Baptism of Hereticks;
              and this was
              the best Excuse St. <hi>Augustin</hi> could make for St.
              <hi>Cyprian</hi> that though he
              was
              mistaken
              in this matter,
              yet he was
              no Schismatick,
              but maintained
              the Peace and Unity of the Church, notwithstanding those
              different
              Opinions
              and Practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon a like account <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
              reproves
              <hi>Victor,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for
              excommunicating
              the <hi>Asiatick</hi>
              Churches,
              because they adhered
              to their ancient Custom of observing
              <hi>Easter,</hi> very different from the custom of the
              <hi>Latin</hi> Churches,
            
            whereas they might both retain their
            
            
            peculiar Customes
              without Schism, and so they had
              done
              many years,
              and amicably
              communicated
              with one another, and particularly
              instances
              in <hi>Anicetus</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who
              had
              some kind dispute
              about it, and though neither of
              them
              could perswade
              the other to alter the Custom of his Church, yet
              communicated
              together with all the expressions
              of Love and Unity, insomuch that <hi>Anicetus</hi>
              allowed
              <hi>Polycarp</hi> to consecrate in his own Church at
              <hi>Rome.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, if we lay all these together, we shall
              easily
              perceive, what little foundation there
              is
              in any thing St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              has
              said,
              for the Independency of Bishops;
              for it amounts
              to no more but this, that in matter of Discipline and
              Ecclesiastical Government, some
              Bishops
              may differ from others in matters
              of less moment, for which they ought not to be
              deposed
              nor excommunicated,
              while they preserve the Peace and
              Unity of the
              Church, and maintain Communion
              with their Fellow Bishops;
              which necessarily
              supposes,
              that Ecclesiastical
              Communion is
              as indispensible a Duty among Bishops,
              as Brotherly Communion is
              among other Christians;
              which plainly
              overthrows
              Episcopal Independency,
            
            
            
            and proves
              that there is
              but one Church, and one Communion, since there
              is
              but one Episcopal Office, whereby this one Church
              is
              ruled
              and governed;
              and that all Bishops
              are bound
              to live in Communion with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shall briefly
              urge but one thing more to prove that the Unity of the
              Christian Church consists
              in one Communion,
              and that is
              from the nature of Church censures.
              Excommunication casts
              a man out of the visible Society of Christ's Church, not of
              this or that particular
              Church only, but of the whole Christian Church; that as
              Baptism makes
              a man a member of the Universal
              Church, and gives
              him
              right to Christian Communion in all the
              Churches
              of the World, where he can enjoy it without sin, so
              Excommunication debats
              men
              from Christian Communion in all
              Churches;
              he that is
              cast out of one Church, is
              thereby cast out of all, and separated
              from the Body of Christ, which is
              but one. It is
              a very dilute explication of Church-censures,
              to say only, that it was
              a Law and Custom, in order to preserve Peace and
              correspondence
              between several Churches,
            
            
            that no Church should admit to Communion
              those which were
              excommunicated
              by another, or did
              Schismatically
              divide: It was
              indeed forbid by the ancient Canons
              to receive those into Communion, who
              had
              been
              excommunicated
              by another Church, which lived
              in Catholick
              Communion, without
              satisfaction first given
              to that Church; but this was
              not meerly
              an
              arbitrary term of Concord, as it
              is
              among Confederate Princes,
              that one shall not entertain those who are
              Rebells
              to the other, but it is
              an
              essential part of Catholick
              Communion, without
              which Excommunication can have no effect, nor any thing
              terrible in it. That which makes
              Excommunication so dreadful a Sentence,
              is,
              that it cuts
              men
              off from the Body of Christ, which, when
              duely
              administred,
              cuts
              them
              off from all communion with Christ, and from all
              hopes
              of Salvation; for it was
              universally
              acknowledged
              by the Primitive
              Church, that out of the Church there
              is
              no Salvation; that Christ hath
              but one Body, and is
              the Saviour only of his Body, and that the power of the
              Keys,
              which Christ committed
              to his Apostles
              and their Successors,
              signifies
            
            
            
            Authority to receive into the Church, and to cast out; and
              when men
              are, for just and weighty reasons,
              cast out of the visible Communion of Christ's Church, they
              are separated
              from Christ; what is
              thus bound
              on Earth, is
              bound
              in Heaven, and therefore such men
              are out of a state of Salvation, as a
              withered
              branch which is
              lopt
              off from the Tree, receives
              no longer
              any Life and nourishment from the Root; and
              therefore
              what the Sentence of Death is
              in the State, that the Sentence of
              Excommunication
              is
              in the Church; Temporal
              Death cuts
              men
              off from the Societies
              of Mankind, Excommunication cuts
              them
              off from the Communion and Society of
              Christians
              in this World, and, if duely
              executed,
              from all the Rewards
              of the next, unless by the exercise
              of a serious repentance they recover
              the Peace of the Church again.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, unless Excommunication
              cuts
              men
              off from the whole Body of Christians,
              as well as from that particular
              Church wherein they dwelt,
              it is
              as very a Scare-crow indeed as most
              Christians
              in our dayes
              think it to be: for, if after they are cast out of one
              Church, they have right to communicate in other
            
            
            Churches,
              then they are the Members
              of the Body of Christ still, and have a right to all the
              Priviledges
              of Christians,
              and Excommunication signifies
              no more, than for a man to be turned
              out of one Family upon some pike and quarrel, and
              immediately
              received
              into another, and it may be a better.
          </p>
          <p>If Excommunication does
            not cast men
            out of the Catholick
            Communion of Christians,
            then men
            who are cast out of one Church have yet a right to communicate
            in others, and then those Canons
            which forbid receiving
            such who are excommunicated
            out of a pretence
            to maintain Peace and Concord among all
            Churches,
            incroach
            upon the Rights
            of Christians,
            and deny Communion
            to those to whom
            they cannot lawfully
            deny it.</p>
          <p>
            Whoever reads
              <hi>Synesius</hi> his Excommunication
              of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> can hardly
              imagine, that the debarring
              the Excommunicate
              from the Communion of all Churches,
              as well as of that Church which
              excommunicated
              them,
              should be a mere Ecclesiastical Law. He writes a Letter to
              all Bishops,
              wherein he first
            
            gives
              a large account of the barbarous
              Villanies
              of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and his Companions,
            
            
            
            and then adds;
              <hi>For these reasons,
              the Church of</hi> Ptolemais (a small Church where
              <hi>Synesius</hi> was
              Bishop) <hi>commands
              all her Sister Churches,
              all the World over, that no Church of God shall be open
              to</hi> Andronicus <hi>and his Companions,
              and</hi> Thoantes <hi>and his Companions;
              let all Religious Houses
              be shut against them;
              there is
              no place for the Devil in Paradice,
              who, if he privately
              get in, must be thrust out again. I command all, both
              private men
              and publick
              Magistrates,
              to separate them
              both from their bed and board, and
              especially
              Bishops,
              who shall neither salute them
              while they live, nor bury
              them
              when they dye;
              and if any one despises
              the Censures
              of this little Church, and receives
              those to Communion, who are condemned
              by her, as if there were
              no necessity
              of obeying
              a poor Church, let such a man know, that he
              divides
              the Church, which Christ will have to be but one, and
              whether he be Deacon, Presbyter, or
              Bishop, he
              shall be to us as</hi> Andronicus
              <hi>is,
              neither will we ever give him

          <p>This is
            the true Spirit of the Ancient Discipline, and therefore to
            prevent Abuses
            of this kind, when any considerable
            Persons
            were
            excommunicated,
            they sent
            advice of it to other Churches,
            and where there was
            no notice given,
            they would not receive any Travellers,
            whether Lay or Clergy, into the Communion of the Church where
            they came,
            till they produced
            their formed
            or communicatory Letters
            from the Church from whence they
            came,
            that thereby they might know whether they
            were
            owned
            by that Church, and were
            in Communion with it. But of this more hereafter.</p>

            briefly
            shewn
            the Use of this Notion of Catholick
            Communion, in the Disputes
            of Schism and Separation.</head>
          <p>
            HAving,
              in the former Chapter sufficiently
              proved,
              that the Unity of the Catholick
              Church consists
              in one Communion, to prepare the way, for what
              follows,
              I shall make some few
            
            
            
            Remarks
              oh what I have already discours'd.
          </p>
          <p>As first, That to be in Communion with any Church
            signifies
            to be a Member of
            it: for Christian Communion is
            nothing else but Christian Fellowship and Society; and to be
            in Church-Fellowship is
            to be a Member of a Church.</p>
          <p>None were
            ever allowed
            Christian Communion but those who
            were
            first Christians,
            that is,
            received
            into the Society of Christ's Church, by Baptism
            made
            Members
            of his Body: Christian Communion
            was
            confined
            to the Christian
            Church, and was
            not common to Pagans
            and Infidels.</p>
          <p>
            And every Member of the Christian Church, who
              is
              not under Church-censures,
              was
              always
              thought to have equal Right and equal Obligation to all
              parts
              of Christian Communion; there was
              no such thing as partial, or <hi>occasional Communion</hi>
              known
              in the ancient Church: for men,
              suppose, to communicate
              in hearing
              Sermons,
              and not to communicate in Prayers
              or Sacraments,
              nor submit to Church Order and Discipline,
              or one day to communicate in one Church, and all the year
              after to
            
            
            profess themselves Members
              of a distinct and opposite Church: when
              was
              it ever heard
              of, that a Donatist occasionally
              communicated
              in the Catholick
              Church, or a Catholick
              Christian in a Donatist Church? neither the
              Catholicks
              nor nor the Schismaticks
              would allow of this, but kept
              their Communions
              distinct and
              separate; for no man has
              right to any act of Communion in a Church of which he
              is
              no Member.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Catholick
              Christian</hi> was
              never heard
              of till Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made
              the discovery;
              neither the Ancient Church, nor our old
              Non-conformists
              take any notice of those Catholick
              Christians,
              who can communicate with a Church, and separate from it at
              the same time; whose <hi>Catholicism</hi>
              consists
              in communicating
              <hi>occasionally</hi>
              (that is,
              as the toy takes
              them,
              or as it will serve an
              interest)
              with all the several Sects
              and Parties
              of Christians,
              without living
              in Communion with any of them;
              and it is
              an
              admirable resolution Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              makes
              in the name of his <hi>mere Non-conformists,
              and we will be members
              of no particular Church which alloweth
              us not occasional Communion with others, but take such
              for</hi>
            
            <hi>Sectaries,</hi>
              that is,
              with other Churches
            
            
            
            of distinct and separate Communions;
              so that, according
              to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Principles,
              those men
              are Sectaries
              who allow but <hi>one Catholick
              Church,</hi> and <hi>one Catholick
              Communion</hi> in that one Church; and the
              onely
              way to avoid being
              particular
              Sectaries,
              is
              to be Catholick
              Sectaries,
              not to confine themselves to one Communion, but to take
              their turns
              occasionally
              in all. This <hi>Baxterian Catholick</hi>
              is
              nothing else but a <hi>Protean Religionist,</hi> who
              transforms
              himself into all shapes,
              and differs
              from the <hi>Hobbist</hi> only in this, that the
              <hi>Hobbist</hi> is
              for being
              alwayes
              of his Prince's Religion, but he
              is
              alwayes
              for being
              against it; for if any one Religion be
              established
              by Publick
              Authority to the disallowing
              of all others, that must be <hi>Sectarianism,</hi>
              and our Catholick
              Christian cannot
              be a <hi>Sectarian.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly,
              I observe farther, that that is
              a Schismatical Communion, which
              does
              not make us Members
              of the Catholick
              Church; for if there be but one Church, and one Communion,
              then to live in Communion with any Church which
              is
              not a Member of the Catholick
              Church, nor makes
              up one Communion
              with it, is
              Schism; and therefore
            
            
            Independency, in the very nature of it,
              is
              a Schism; for every Independent
              Congregation is
              a distinct Church, and has
              a distinct Communion of its
              own: no man is
              made
              a Member of all Independent Congregations,
              by being
              a Member of one, for their Church-membership
              depends
              upon a particular, explicit Church-Covenant between
              Pastor and
              People, which can reach no farther than that particular
              Church to which it was
              made;
              nor is
              their Pastor a Minister of the Universal Church, but of that
              particular Church which chose
              him
              for their Pastor; and therefore, when he
              preaches
              to other Congregational
              Churches,
              he preaches
              only as a gifted
              Brother, and not as Pastor; so that there are as many
              distinct Communions
              and Churches,
              as there are Independent
              Congregations,
              which are not Members
              of each other, and hold no Communion with each other but
              upon courtesie,
              and therefore are all Schismaticks.
          </p>
          <p>
            And wherever there are distinct and separate
              Communions
              and Churches,
              which do not own Church-membership with each other, but
              though they live in the same place, yet divide into
              several
            
            
            
            distinct Congregations,
              under different
              Governours,
              and opposite Orders
              and Rules,
              there is
              certainly
              a Schism on one side or other: where there are two distinct
              and opposite Communions,
              one of them
              must be Schismatical, because
              there ought to be but one.
          </p>
          <p>
            For nothing can be more wild than Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Notion of
              a Catholick
              Church, which he every where drives
              at; that the Catholick
              Church is
              nothing else but either the whole number of
              Christians
              professing
              the Faith of Christ, all the World over, without any respect
              to Church Communion; or that the
              Catholick
              Church is
              made
              up of all the several Sects
              and combinations
              of Christians,
              without respect to <hi>one Communion.</hi>
              Thus he declares
              the sense of his <hi>mere Non-conformist. We hold we must
              separate from no Church or Christian
              farther than
              they separate from Christ, though we must not sin against
              God for communion
              with any. We take it for a great sin for</hi>
            
            <hi>any Party to appropriate the Church only to
              themselves</hi> (but it is
              no sin to make Parties,
              so they do not Schismatically
              appropriate the Church onely
              to themselves)
              <hi>we own no Church but as part of the
              Catholick
              (or Universal) Church,</hi> that
              is,
              all the distinct and opposite Churches
            
            
            and Communions,
              are parts
              and Branches
              of the Universal Church, wch, at this rate, can
              be no better, than a mere chimerical notion, one Communion
              made
              up of a hundred separate  opposite
              Communions;
              a Body made
              up of several Members,
              which are at a great Distance from each other, and of such a
              different Make and Frame, that they cannot
              possibly
              be united:
              Yes, says
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> we are united
              to all Churches,
              (and he tells
              us how) <hi>And we hold all our
              Assemblies
              as in Union and Communion with all the true
              Churches
              on Earth;</hi> if it were
              not for that <hi>as,</hi> this would be somthing to the
              purpose, to clear them
              from the guilt of <hi>Schism, that they hold their
              Assemblies
              in Union and Communion with all true
              Churches
              on Earth.</hi> But I fear, <hi>as in Union,</hi> may
              signifie
              as out of Union, but as it were
              in Union.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Instance, How do our present
              Dissenters
              <hi>hold their Assemblies,
              as in union and Communion with the Church of</hi> England?
              Why truly,
              as if they were
              out of Communion
              with her; for I would desire any man to tell me, how we may
              more perfectly
              renounce the
              Communion of any Church, and set up distinct and opposite
              Communions,
              than our Dissenters
              have done.
              If forming
              Churches
              under new and distinct Officers,
              with new Rules
              and Methods
              of
            
            
            
            Worship and Discipline, without any
              Dependance
              on the publick
              Constitution,
              be to live as in Union and Communion
              of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the magical
              vertue
              of this, as they may be said
              to hold their Assemblies
              in Union and Communion with the
              Papists
              and Quakers,
              and Independents,
              whom
              they formerly
              accused
              of Schism and Separation.
              What invisible kind of Communion
              he may mean, I know not; but, Church Communion
              is
              such a visible Fellowship, as is
              necessary to make a visible Society, and such Communion we
              cannot see, no not with the Help of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
              <hi>Spectacles.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            But he adds,
              <hi>and</hi> (we) <hi>put up our
              Prayers
              and Praises
              as in Conjunction with theirs, not
              owning
              their Failings
              (or our own) but their Duties;</hi>
              this, <hi>as in Conjunction,</hi>
              is
              like praising
              men
              with a <hi>but,</hi> which spoils
              all; for it is
              an
              odd kind of <hi>Conjunction,</hi> when they will not so much
              as use the same Words
              in Prayer with us, nor pray in the same place, nor at the
              same time neither, were
              it not to prevent all <hi>Conjunction.</hi> And therefore,
              what he means
              by putting
              up their Prayers,
              <hi>as in Conjunction,</hi> with others, I cannot imagine,
              since Conjunction
            
            
            in Prayers
              either signifies
              Praying
              together, and putting
              up our Petitions
              in common for us all, or praying,
              though at distant places,
              yet in Unity and Concord, and Christian
              Communion,
              that is,
              in the External Communion
              of the Church; and thus Schismaticks,
              who divide the Church, can never pray in Conjunction with
              the Christian Church, and let them
              then make the best they can of their, <hi>as in
              conjunction.</hi> But what he adds
              is
              the prettiest
              fetch of all, whereby he would perswade
              us, that they separate no more from other
              Churches,
              than they do from themselves, <hi>not
              owning
              their failings
              (nor our own) but their Duties:</hi>
              which words,
              if they have any sense, must signifie,
              that because
              they <hi>own their Duties,</hi>
              that is,
              that Prayer, and Preaching,
              and singing
              Psalms,
              and receiving
              the Lord's Supper,
              are necessary Duties
              of Religion,
              but disown <hi>their failings,</hi>
              that is,
              their manner of performing
              these Duties,
              and therefore cannot joyn
              in External
              Worship, yet they put up their Prayers
              and Praises
              <hi>in conjunction</hi> with them:
              as if Christian Communion consisted
              in owning
              Christian Duties,
              not in joyning
              in them.
              I am
              sure St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            
            
            
            asserts,
              that those
            
            men
              cannot be said
              to pray in Unity and Concord,
              who divide the Unity
              of the Church; <hi>for, how can he agree with any one, who
              does
              not agree with the Body of the Church, and the whole
              Christian Fraternity;</hi> and therefore he
              did
              not believe that such men
              put up their Prayers,
              <hi>as in conjunction,</hi> with those from
              whom
              they separate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ancient Christians,
              who acknowledged
              the necessity of one Communion,
              as well as of one Church, found no difficulty in the Notion
              of Schism, though upon occasion they
              disputed
              warmly,
              which of the dividing
              Parties
              were
              Schismaticks.
              St. <hi>Augustin</hi> makes
              this the Description of Schismaticks,
              * <hi>that they are those, who</hi>
            
            <hi>do not communicate with the
              Catholick
              Church, but hold separate Meetings
              in Conventicles
              of their own.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              tells
              us, <hi>that the Christian Church, which
              is
              the Spouse of Christ, knows
            
            
            but one house, and preserves
              the Chastity of one Bed:</hi> And the Character of a
              Schismatick
              is,
              that he is
              <hi>extra Ecclesiam, foris,
              one who is
              out of the Church, without doores:</hi>
              and one
            
            <hi>who gathers
              People any where besides
              the Church,</hi> and one
            
            <hi>who forsakes
              the Church, and erects
              other houses
              and habitations
              for himself,</hi> that is,
              new Conventicles
              and places
              of meeting
              in opposition to the Church: And two
            
            Pastors
              and two Flocks,
              (that is,
              two opposite or separate Churches)
              when Christ has
              said,
              that there shall be but one Shephered,
              and one Flock, is
              a state of Schism. But I shall have occasion to discourse of
              this more in what follows;
              but this is
              sufficient at present to shew
              that Schism is
              a breach of Catholick
              Communion, and that any Church which
              does
              not hold Communion
              with the Catholick
              Church is
              Schismatical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly,
              I observe farther, that <hi>Personal,
              Local, Praesential</hi> Communion,
              is
              not the entire notion of Christian
              Communion,
            
            
            
            nor essential to the Notion of a Church. For then there can
              be no Catholick
              Church, nor Catholick
              Communion all
              the World over, for the Christians,
              who are dispersed
              all the World over: can never enjoy <hi>Personal</hi> and
              <hi>Presential</hi> Communion with each other, that
              is,
              cannot all meet together to worship God at the same time, in
              the same place, and to discharge those other
              Acts
              of Christian Communion, which require their personal
              presence with each other. And yet the
              Catholick
              Church is
              more properly
              a Church, than any particular Churches,
              which are called
              Churches,
              only as they are Branches
              and Members
              of the Catholick
              Church; for it is
              the Catholick
              Church which is
              the Body of Christ, and particular
              Churches
              and particular Christians
              are the Members
              of Christ's Body, as they are Members
              of the Universal
              Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entire Notion of Christian Communion,
              contains
              all those Duties
              and Offices
              which all Christians
              are bound
              to perform, whether they respect the Worship of God, or that
              relation they stand in to each other, as
              Members
              of the same Body: some of which we owe
            
            
            to all Christians,
              all the World over, and therefore may and must be
              performed,
              when we are absent from one another; others require the
              Communion of
              Christian Assemblies
              for the Exercise
              of Religious Worship, others allow
              of such convenient distance as will admit of the Communion
              of Discipline and Government: which, in few
              cases,
              was
              to be confined
              to the next Neighbourhood,
              or the compass of personal Conversation, and there
              is
              as little reason
              it should be thus confined
              in Ecclesiastical
              as in Civil Governments.
          </p>
          <p>
            That <hi>praesential and personal</hi>
              Communion
              which is
              necessary to the Being
              of a Church, as it is
              a religious Society for divine Worship, must be
              performed
              by parts,
              in the Assemblies
              of neighbour Christians,
              who meet together to worship
              God and their Saviour, and hold Communion with all other
              religious Assemblies
              and Christian Churches.
              This, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> well observes,
              <hi>The very</hi>
            
            <hi>nature of the thing requires,</hi>
              but if Christ hath
              instituted
              but one Church, and one Communion all the World over, there
              is
              something more than this <hi>praesential
              Communion</hi> necessary to the
              Constitution
              of the Church, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
            
            
            
            himself owns,
              that there is
              something more required
              to the Constitution of a Church, than
              <hi>An
              Assembly
              for divine</hi>
            
            <hi>Worship;</hi> though I could never yet see any
              shew
              of proof, that <hi>those Societies</hi>
            
            <hi>which have not, or which cannot have
              Assemblies
              for divine Worship, are not Churches
              properly
              so called,</hi>
              which though he says,
              <hi>need not here be insisted
              on,</hi> was
              indeed, the only thing which wanted
              proof: For the Universal Church
              is
              much more properly
              a Church, than any particular Churches,
              which are but Parts
              and Members
              of it; and yet cannot have such
              an
              Universal Assembly
              for Divine Worship;
              but must have particular Assemblies
              for that purpose: and then I would desire any man to
              shew
              me, why particular
              Churches,
              which are under one Government or Discipline, may not
              consist of several particular religious
              Assemblies,
              or parochial Churches?
              If this be contrary to the Notion of a Church, then there
              cannot be one Catholick
              Church and Catholick
              Communion;
              if it be not contrary to the Notion
              of a Church, how does
              it destroy the nature of particular
              Churches?
          </p>
          <p>
            Were
              it as impossible, by the care of several parochial
              Ministers,
              and the vigilant
            
            
            Inspection and Government of one Bishop, to exercise true
              Evangelical
              Discipline in a Diocesan Church, as it
              is
              for all the Christians
              in one Diocese to meet ordinarily
              together for religious
              Worship, I would readily
              yield the Cause; but if it be very practicable to govern a
              much larger
              Society than can ordinarily
              meet for Worship, the Argument
              will not hold from the necessity of particular
              Assemblies
              for religious Worship,
              to prove that Church Communion
              must be no larger
              than a religious Assembly;
              which, by the way, also shews,
              how fond that Conceit is,
              that the Pastor
              of every particular Congregation, must <hi>have all the
              Powers
              of Teaching
              and Ruling
              by the Word and Keys,</hi>
              and that <hi>every single Congregation, must have full Power
              to reform it self.</hi> I grant this Power must be in every
              Church, in some Measure, but it
              does
              not hence follow, that it must reside in every Pastor and
              single Congregation, because a particular
              Church may be of a larger
              Extent than the Bounds
              of a single Congregation,
              and then a particular Congregation
              being
              not an
              entire Church, but part of a Church, there
              is
              no reason it should be invested
              with the whole power
            
            
            
            of the Church; you may as well say, that every Family must
              have the whole power of the Kingdom for the Government of
              it's self. The Master of the Family
              has
              so much Power over his Children
              and Servants,
              as is
              necessary for the orderly Government of his
              Family; but
              such Crimes
              as fall under the Cognizance of a
              higher
              Power, must be referred
              to their proper Judicatures.
              Thus the Pastor of particular parochial
              Churches,
              has
              Power to reprove, admonish,
              instruct, exhort, and to absolve
              Penitents,
              who are under no Church-Censures,
              and in the danger of Death,
            
            though they are, and to suspend from the Table of our Lord,
              giving
              a timely account to his Bishop, why he
              does
              so; and this is
              all the Discipline which is
              absolutely
              necessary in a Parochial Church,
              reserving
              the Judicial Censures
              of the Church to the proper Seat of
              Ecclesiastical
              Authority.
          </p>
          <p n="4">4. I observe farther, That it
            is
            not at the choice of particular
            Christians,
            to communicate with what Church they please, but they are
            bound
            to communicate
            with that part of the Catholick
            Church, wherein they live.</p>
          
          
          <p>The Reason of this is
            very plain; because
            there is
            but one Church, and every
            Christian is
            bound
            to communicate with this one Church; and there
            is
            no way to maintain Communion with the
            Catholick
            Church, but by communicating
            with some part of it; and to separate
            causelessly
            from any one part of the Catholick
            Church, is
            to break the Communion
            of the whole, which is
            one by the Communion of all it's
            Parts
            and Members:
            and therefore willfully
            or wantonly
            to refuse Communion with that part of the Church wherein we
            live, is
            a Schism from the whole.</p>
          <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has
            every where in his late Books
            advanced
            a great many odd Principles
            to justifie
            Separation, which (if what I have already
            discoursed
            hold good, that there is
            but one Catholick
            Church, united
            by one Catholick
            Communion) must of necessity be false; as to name some which
            fall under this Head.</p>
          <p>
            He supposes,
              that men
              may separate from particular Churches,
              without separating
              from the Catholick
              Church. <hi>It is
              one thing to separate from the Universal</hi>
            
            <hi>Church, and another from particular
              Churches,
              or a few only:</hi> Now this is
            
            
            
            true, if those particular Churches
              be Schismatical, <hi>i. e.</hi> are not in
              Communion
              with the Catholick
              Church, for it is
              no Schism to separate from Schismaticks:
              but if those particular Churches
              are Members
              of the Catholick
              Church by a Catholick
              Communion, to separate from such a particular
              Catholick
              Church, is
              to separate from the Universal Catholick
              Church; to divide from any part of the
              Catholick
              Church, breaks
              Catholick
              Communion; and according
              to the ancient Discipline, those who
              Schismatically
              divided
              from one Church, were
              accounted
              Schismaticks,
              all the World over, and denied
              Communion in
              all Churches.
              Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              denied
              Communion to <hi>Maximus,</hi> a Presbyter, and
              <hi>Augendus,</hi> a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and <hi>Machaeus</hi>
              and <hi>Longinus,</hi> who were
            
            sent
              to him
              from <hi>Novatianus,</hi> an
              Anti-Bishop, Schismatically
              ordained
              at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius</hi>
              was
              before Canonically
              elected,
              ordained,
              and possess'd of the Chair; for there can be no
              Catholick
              Communion, if one Church receive those who separate
              Schismatically
              from another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nay, which is
              more strange than this, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              sayes,
              that a man <hi>may separate
            
            
            from all the particular Churches
              in the</hi>
            
            <hi>World, as if they were
              no true political Churches
              of Christ, and not renounce the Universal Church,</hi> as,
              he sayes,
              <hi>the Seekers
              do, who say, that the Ministry,
              Scriptures,
              and Churches,
              are lost
              in the wilderness:</hi>
              Now indeed, if there be no true Church in the World, a man
              may separate
              from all particular Churches,
              without
              separating
              from the Catholick
              Church; for then Communion with the
              Catholick
              Church does
              not require External, visible Communion, when there
              is
              no visible Church, (if we may suppose any such case) but
              is
              maintained
              by Internal Communion of Faith and Love; but if we will
              acknowledg
              these particular Churches,
              or any of them
              to be true Churches,
              he who separates
              from all particular Churches,
              must separate from the Universal Church: for, the Universal
              Church may be notionally,
              but is
              not really
            
            distinguish'd from all particular
              Churches,
              no more than the whole is
              from its
              parts,
              and may be preserved
              in any one particular Church, as at first it
              began
              in the Catholick
              Church of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> and we may as well say, that
              one of our Members
              may be separated
              from every
            
            
            
            part of the Body, but not from the whole Body, as that a
              Christian may separate from every particular Church, and not
              separate from, (which I suppose
              he means
              by <hi>renouncing)
              the Church Universal,</hi> unless he can find another Body,
              besides
              all its
              parts,
              and an
              Universal
              Church, besides
              all particular Churches.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the fundamental mistake, which
              runs
              him
              into so many other of this nature,
              is
              this, <hi>that reception into a
              particular</hi>
            
            <hi>Church is
              no work of Baptism, as such, but a consequent act (in order
              of nature alwayes,
              and often of time) the Eunuch,</hi>
              Acts
              8. <hi>was
              baptized
              into no Church but the Universal;</hi> and
              therefore,
              though he acknowledges,
              that <hi>it is
              very fit</hi> (I perceive he dares
              not say necessary) <hi>that every one that can, be a member
              of some particular Church; yet Baptism, as such,
              is
              no such thing, nor hath
              such an
              effect.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            So that, it seems,
              a man may be a Christian, without
              being
              a Member of any Christian Church; or, at least, may be a
              member of the Universal Church, without
              being
              a Member of any particular
              Church; a member of the whole
            
            
            Body, without being
              united
              to any part of the Body.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if Baptism be an
              external and visible
              Sacrament of our admission into the visible Church, it
              necessarily
              exacts
              from us visible Communion, and we cannot have a visible
              Communion with a Metaphysical Notion of
              an
              <hi>Eutopian</hi> Universal Church, but must
              communicate
              with some visible part of it. I would fain know, whether
              Baptism makes
              us Members
              of the Universal Church? if it does,
              then it obliges
              us to all the Duties
              and Offices
              of Church-members,
              and they are comprehended
              <hi>in visible Communion,</hi> when it can be
              had,
              and so makes
              us members
              of some Church wherewith we may
              communicate
              visibly:
              If it does
              not, I would willingly
              know, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means
              by being
              <hi>baptized
              into the Universal Church?</hi> Not that I think Baptism
              makes
              us members
              of any one particular Church, contradistinct
              from all others, but so makes
              us Members
              of the Universal Church, that we are
              bound
              to communicate with any part of the
              Catholick
              Church, where we are, that is,
              with any particular
              Church which is
              in Catholick
              Communion: and therefore, for our
            
            
            
            ordinary Communion, we are bound
              to communicate with that part of the Church where we live;
              and in case we travel into Foreign
              Countreys,
              where there are any truly
              Catholick
              Churches,
              we are bound
              to communicate with them
              also, while we tarry there, and have right to it, as we are
              Members
              of the Universal Church; for this particular
              Church-membership is
              a Schismatical notion, destructive of
              Catholick
              Communion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon the same mistake, he leaves
              it at the free choice of every particular Christian, what
              Church he will communicate
              with, and how far. Part of his definition of <hi>a single
              Church, is,
              a</hi>
            
            <hi>Society of Christians
              associated
              by consent,</hi> and upon this account
              calls
              them
              <hi>Volunteers:</hi>
              Now so far he is
              in the right, that no man can be a Christian but by his own
              consent; but when a man has
              consented
              to be a Christian, and is
              admitted
              by Baptism, there is
              no new consent
              required
              to make him
              a Member of a Church, and to oblige
              him
              to Christian
              Communion, if he resolve to continue
              a Christian. Christian Churches
              are not <hi>voluntary Associations,</hi>
              but a Divine
              Institution; and when Christ has
            
            
            instituted
              but one Church, there is
              no choice in the case, we must either be
              members
              of that one Church, or of none at all.
              Men
              ought not indeed, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              speaks,
              <hi>be forced
              into a Temple, not consenting,
              for then it is
              a Prison, and they are not a Church;</hi> but if they do not
              joyn
              in all those acts
              of Christian Communion,
              to which their Baptism and profession of Christianity
              obliges
              them,
              they ought to be thrown
              out of the Church again, as those who renounce their
              Christian Profession; which is
              a much better way to make men
              sensible of their obligation to <hi>Christian
              Communion,</hi>
              then as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes,
              to <hi>make them</hi>
            
            <hi>take it still against their
              wills,
              and, as it were,
              to cram and drench them
              with Sacred
              Mysteries.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Such another mistake it is,
              when he founds
              the Church-relation between Pastor and People, upon the
              Peoples
              voluntary choice and consent to take
            
            such a man for their Pastor: for not to dispute now what
              interest the People
              have in the choice of their Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              which the Dean has
              so largely
              and learnedly
              discours'd, it is
              evident, that the Relation between
              Pastors
              and People is
              not founded
              on
            
            
            
            their particular Choice and Election, but on that Authority
              Christ hath
              given
              to his Ministers,
              to instruct and govern
              his Church; and when men
              consent to be
              Christ's Disciples,
              they consent to
              submit to that Authority Christ
              hath
              instituted
              in his Church. Though we should suppose, that no Bishop can
              regularly
              be ordained
              without the Peoples
              consent, which can never be proved,
              yet it is
              not the Peoples
              consent, but his Ordination which
              gives
              him
              that Authority in the Church. Baptism and the visible
              Profession of Christianity,
              without any farther consent makes
              such men
              Christ's Flock, and obliges
              them
              to obey their Spiritual Guides
              and Pastors;
              and Ordination, according
              to Christ's Institution, makes
              others Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              and invests
              them
              with Authority to instruct and govern, and this
              is
              the foundation of a Church-Relation.

            But, sayes
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the Person of the
              <hi>meer
              Non-conformists,
              we think that all</hi>
            
            <hi>Churches
              should prefer a faithful Pastor before
              an
              unfaithful and insufficient one, and a
              purer
              Church before a more corrupt:</hi> which, if it
              signifies
              any thing to justifie
              their Schism, fairly
              insinuates,
              that Non-conformists
            
            
            are the most faithful Pastors,
              and Conventicles
              the purest
              Churches;
              the usual Complements
              they pass upon themselves, and the Church of
              <hi>England.</hi> But to let that pass, no doubt but
              Christians,
              when they may, must choose the faithfullest
              Pastors,
              and the purest
              Churches.
              What then? Why then they may choose Schismatical
              Pastors,
              if they judge them
              the most faithful,
              and set up Schismatical Conventicles
              for the sake of a purer
              Communion.
              This was
              the very Argument of the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              and <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              but not thought sufficient to justifie
              their Schism, either by St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or St.
              <hi>Austin:</hi> and that for this reason, because there
              is
              but one Church, and we must not go out of the Church to seek
              for faithful Pastors,
              or a purer
              Communion. As far as this may be
              done
              with the preservation
              of Catholick
              Unity and Communion,
              we may, and ought to do it; but we must separate from no
              Church where we can communicate without sin, though some
              Pastors
              may be less faithful or sufficient;
              or there may be some less material
              corruptions
              in its
              Worship or Discipline. Christians
              must preserve themselves as pure as may be in the
              Catholick
            
            
            
            Communion, but must still be careful to hold Communion with
              the Catholick
              Church, by communicating
              with that part of it where they dwell, and to set up
              distinct Churches
              merely
              for some greater
              degrees
              of purity, is
              a Schism from the Universal Church, as it
              divides
              and separates
              the Commun_on
              of Christians.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shall take notice but of one Distinction
              more, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
              makes
              to qualifie
              and extenuate the Evil of Separation, and that
              is
              between local and mental Separation; <hi>It
              is
              one thing to separate locally
              by bodily
              Absence, and</hi>
            
            <hi>another mentally
              by schismatical Principles.</hi>
              This he urges
              in several places,
              and flies to, as a safe Retreat, upon all
              occasions;
              and makes
              it to be no more than what is
              often, and indeed too often, practised
              in <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, by those who leave their
              Parish Churches,
              and communicate with other Parish
              Churches.
              Now I grant there is
              a Difference between local and mental Separation, but I
              think it will do Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> no great Service to
              justifie
              his Schism; for if this local Separation be for the sake of
              a distinct and separate Communion, it
              is
              schismatical; if it be not, it may be
              disorderly,
            
            
            but not Schismatical: As for Instance.
          </p>
          <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> separates
            <hi>locally</hi>
            from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he
            prays
            and preaches
            in Conventicles,
            and this is
            schismatical; not because his Conventicle
            is
            in one place, and the Parish-Church in another, for so all
            Parish-Churches
            are locally
            distant and separate; but because his Conventicle
            is
            a separate Communion, set up in Distinction or Opposition to
            the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But those who leave their own
            Parish Churches,
            and go to other Parish-Churches
            in the same Communion, tho they are disorderly in it, unless
            upon some great Occasions,
            yet they are not schismatical, because they do not go out of
            the Communion of the Church. The Difference between these two
            sorts
            of men,
            is
            like the difference between a Souldier's
            breaking
            his Rank, and his forsaking
            his Colours,
            and revolting
            to the Enemy; they are both indeed
            local
            Separations,
            as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> says,
            but yet one is
            Wantonness or Folly, the other Treason.</p>
          <p>
            So that this distinction between <hi>local</hi> and
              <hi>mental Separation,</hi> is
              very illogical and fallacious, because the
              parts
              of it
            
            
            
            are not distinct: local Separation may be mental also, upon
              schismatical Principles,
              as all that Separation is,
              which divides
              Communion, when men
              set up distinct and separate Churches
              or Conventicles:
              but when men
              do not break the Communion of the Church, as those do not,
              who only go from one Parish-Church to another, it
              is
              only local and not mental, or upon schismatical
              Principles.
              And on the other hand, whatever
              mental, schismatical Principles
              men
              have, if they do not locally
              separate, that is,
              if they do not divide into separate
              Communions,
              they are not formal Schismaticks:
              and though these mental Schismaticks,
              who divide upon schismatical
              Principles,
              should not always
              separate locally,
              but sometimes
              hold occasional
              Communion with our Parish-Churches,
              yet they are nevertheless Schismaticks
              for all that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifthly,
              I observe farther, that tho the
              Bonds
              and Combinations
              of several Churches
              are ordered
              and determined
              by humane Prudence, yet they are
              founded
              on a divine Right. The Unity
              of the Church is
              as much of divine Right, as any form of Government in it;
              and when the whole Church must
            
            
            be but one, it may be divided
              into greater
              or lesser parts,
              as may best serve the preservation of Unity, Peace, and
              Order, and the Edification of Christians.
          </p>
          <p>When Christ hath
            instituted
            a Catholick
            Church, and Catholick
            Unity, it seems
            strange to me, that a national or patriarchal Church (which
            is
            only such a Combination of several
            Churches
            into one, as may serve the ends
            of Catholick
            Unity) should not be thought as much a divine Institution, as
            any particular Church.</p>
          <p>
            When Christ and his Apostles
              have instituted
              one Form of Government for all particular
              Churches,
              and commanded
              them
              all to live in Unity, and Peace, and Communion, and amicable
              Correspondence
              with each other, the Union and Combination of several
              Churches
              into one, according
              to this Institution, and to serve the
              ends
              of Catholick
              Communion, must be thought as much a divine Institution, as
              the Bounds
              of particular Churches:
              for if we will not allow those Churches
              to be of divine Institution, which have
              Officers
              of divine
              Appointment, and are formed
              according
              to the general Directions
              of
            
            
            
            Christ and his Apostles,
              so as may serve the ends
              of Church Communion, I know not where we can find a Church
              of divine
              Institution in the World.
          </p>
          <p>As for example; Suppose a Church
            governed
            by a Parochial Bishop, with three or four
            Presbyters
            and Deacons
            for his assistance, and Chappels
            of ease, according
            to the number of their Inhabitants,
            be an
            Episcopal Church, of Divine
            Institution, according
            to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
            Model, and (as he sayes)
            the primitive
            pattern; I would desire to know, if the number of
            Souls
            should so increase,
            or the wants
            of them
            be so great, that this Bishop, without
            enlarging
            the bounds
            of his Bishoprick,
            instead of four,
            should need forty Presbyters
            and Deacons,
            and as many Chappels
            of ease for his assistance, whether
            this would be <hi>a new species of
            Churches?</hi></p>
          <p>
            The Authority of the Bishop over forty
              Presbyters,
              and over four, is
              the same kind of Authority, though of
              larger
              extent, and therefore the governing
              Right and Power of Presbyters,
              as Presbyters,
              is
              as much invaded
              where there are but four subject
              Presbyters,
              as where there are forty: <hi>Local</hi>
            
            
            and <hi>Presential</hi> Communion can no more be
              had
              in a Parish, which consists
              of such multitudes
              of Christians,
              as require four
              Chappels
              of Ease, besides
              the Mother Church, as if there were
              forty; and as for that new Notion he
              has
              started,
              of <hi>present,</hi> or <hi>presential
              Communion,</hi>
            
            which is
              not present, where all do not <hi>meet at one place at
              once</hi> (as he observes
              <hi>the tenth
              part of some Parishes,
              cannot) but as Neighbours
              and Citizens
              may have personal converse and meetings,</hi>
              per vices,
              <hi>of some at one time, and some at another.</hi> This may
              be had
              also were
              there forty Chappels
              of Ease, (or in the language of our Church,
              Parishes,
              with fix'd, subject Presbyters
              to instruct and govern them)
              if it be thought necessary
              to the constitution of a Church; and by the vigilancy of one
              Bishop, and many subject Presbyters,
              a Church of a much larger
              extent may be well instructed
              and governed,
              as he himself acknowledges
              it was
              at <hi>Carthage in St. Cyprian's time (a place of greatness,
              and</hi>
            
            <hi>great number of Christians)
              where the Church was
              grown
              very great, but</hi> (as he supposes,
              in favour of his own hypothesis)
              <hi>not beyond the exercise of such
              Personal
              Communion.</hi>
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>So that there can be no specifical
            difference
            between Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Parochial
            Episcopacy and
            Diocesan Episcopacy, but only as to the case of <hi>present
            Communion</hi>
            (of which more hereafter) unless he only allow the name of a
            <hi>Bishop</hi> without the Authority and
            Superiority
            which Bishops
            have alwayes
            challenged
            over Presbyters
            in the first and purest
            Ages
            of the Church, before <hi>worldly
            reasons
            have made
            a change,</hi> as he alwayes
            speaks
            to the reproach of Christianity, even in the
            purest
            Ages
            of it; which he matters
            not much, so it will but justifie
            his own Faction.</p>
          <p>
            The plain truth is,
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> talks
              so uncertainly
              and variously
              in this matter,
              that it is
              very hard to understand what he would have; if you charge
              him
              with opposing
              <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> this he denies,
              for he is
              for a <hi>Parochial Episcopacy,</hi>
              a Bishop over every Parish or Congregation, where they can
              enjoy <hi>present Communion;</hi> For thus <hi>God
              hath
              appointed
              that there shall be stated
              Assemblies
              of Christians,
              especially
              on the Lord's Day, where he shall be
              worshipped,
              men
              instructed,
              and Communion exercised.
              That these Congregations
              should have known
              stated
              Pastors,
              to be their Teachers
              and
            
            
            Guides
              in Worship and holy living.
              That</hi>
            
            <hi>their Pastors,
              by their Office, have the Power
              of the Church-Keys,
              to judge whom
              to take in by Baptism, and whom
              to admonish as criminal, to reject as impenitent, and to
              absolve and receive again as penitent, in their proper
              charge</hi> And thus he has
              only changed
              the name, and every Parish Minister
              is
              a Bishop, and from Presbyterians,
              they are transformed
              into Episcopal
              Divines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, But must this Parish Bishop
            
            have the care of one or more Congregations?
              But of one sure, wherein all the
              Members
              may enjoy <hi>present</hi> and <hi>local
              Communion,</hi> such <hi>Assemblies</hi>
              where <hi>God may be worshipped,
              men
              instructed,
              and Communion exercised.</hi>
              But how does
              this agree with the Primitive Form of Episcopacy, when it
              is
              evident, from all the Records
              of Church-history, even in the Apostles
              times,
              that there were
              more Christians
              in one Church, than could assemble together at one time for
              acts
              of Worship, as it was
              in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> to
              name no more? To avoid this, he
              enlarges
              the notion of <hi>present Communion,</hi> which, he
              sayes,
              does
              not require, <hi>that</hi>
            
            <hi>all must meet at one place at once,</hi> but
            
            
            
            <hi>per vices,
              some at one time, and some at another:</hi> for they must
              all hold present and personal Communion with their Bishop,
              and the Congregation of which they are
              Members;
              though indeed, according
              to his own way, they can never
              communicate in acts
              of worship with the whole Congregation at a time; and
              therefore, unless they change their
              turns
              prudently,
              may never, in all their life have present Communion with the
              tenth
              part of their Church or Congregation;
              which yet is
              as essential to the constitution of a Parochial Episcopacy,
              as to communicate with their Pastor, or Parish Bishop.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what shall those supernumerary
              Christians
              do, who cannot meet at the Parish for ordinary and constant
              Communion?
              Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is
              a little uncertain what to determine: He
              allows
              them
              other Meetings,
              like our
            
            Chappels
              of Ease in many Parishes,
              in dependance
              on the Mother Church, and under the Government of the
              Parish Bishop;
              and therefore, elsewhere, makes
              a Minister of a large Parish, with several
              Curates
              under him,
              to be a primitive Bishop with his
              Presbyters.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            But now the difficulty is,
              what Church-Officers
              these Curates
              are: whether
              they be subject Presbyters
              or not? if they be, then here is
              a Diocesan Bishop
              and his Presbyters:
              for the Form of Government is
              the same with four, as with forty subject
              Presbyters;
              If they be not, (as I know not how they should be, if there
              be no such Officer
            
            as a subject Presbyter, of Divine or Apostolical
              Institution, as he seems
              to think) they must either be Bishops
              or Deacons:
              a Deacon is
              not sufficiently
              qualified
              to be a Bishop's Curate in a distinct
              Chappel
              or Congregation, where all Acts
              of Religious Worship must be performed,
              as well as in the Parish Church; and it
              is
              a great incroachment
              upon the Episcopal Office, to make one Bishop, of equal
              Power and Authority, Curate to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore, to remove this difficulty,
              in another place he explains
              himself either
              otherwise, or more at large, (for I know not well which it
              is,
              and therefore will not affirm either.) His
              words
              are these. <hi>Were
              every Church reduced</hi>
            
            <hi>to such a number, as that all might in season have
              local, personal Communion, like great
              Parishes
              that have Chappels;
            
            
            
            and</hi> e. g. <hi>every Church of 6000 have six
              Pastors
              conjunct, or every Corporation, or market Town (of old
              called
              Cities)
              with the Neighbour Villages,
              be one Church, and one among these
              Pastors
              to be a President
              Bishop, we should think it most like the ancient
              Government.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I would first desire to know, what he would call this
              Form of Church-Government, and what these <hi>conjunct
              Pastors</hi>
              are? whether a Bishop with five subject
              Presbyters,
              or five Bishops,
              with a President Bishop? if the first, it
              looks
              somewhat like the Ancient Government,
              (and is
              the same with our Diocesan Episcopacy)
              excepting
              the name of <hi>six conjunct Pastors;</hi>
              in the Ancient
              Language, none being
              called
              the
            
            <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Church, but the Bishop; if the
              latter, it is
              vastly
              different from the primitive Government, which
              never
              acknowledged
              but one Bishop in a Church; though we should grant
              him
              (of which possibly
              more hereafter) two Bishops
              sometimes
              in a City.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>Secondly,
            I would desire to know, whether these six conjunct
            <hi>Pastors</hi>
            over 6000 Souls,
            have six particular Churches,
            with such particular Souls
            under their proper care, like our
            Parish-Churches,
            with a fixed
            Parish Minister over them?
            if they have, why are they not six distinct
            Churches,
            with their Parochial Bishops,
            independent on each other, but by mutual consent and
            confederation?
            why must the people be bound
            to run from one Church to another,
            to enjoy, by turns,
            present Communion
            with each other? why should not every particular Bishop have
            the power of Censures
            and Excommunication,
            and all parts
            of Discipline in his own hands?</p>
          <p>
            If the Bounds
              and Precincts,
              or Parishes
              (call them
              what you please) be not divided,
              but lye
              in common, in whom
              does
              the Power and Authority reside? if
              equally
              in all, how can Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be sure that six will agree
              in the same thing? Does
              not this lay a foundation of Schism in the Church? to
              prevent which (as St. <hi>Jerom</hi>
              owns)
              Episcopacy
              was
              first instituted;
              if the President have a Negative Voice,
              is
              not this a Tyrannical Usurpation over his Fellow
            
            
            
            Bishops,
              who, by vertue
              of their Office, have the same inherent Authority with
              himself? if the major number of
              Votes
              must determine all Disputes,
              is
              it not a kind of sacrilegious desertion of his
              Ministry, for
              any Bishop to be over-ruled
              in matters
              of Discipline, as it would be to suffer himself to be
              silenced
              by his Fellow Bishops?
              to be a Titular Bishop without the power of Government, but
              when his Fellow Bishops
              give him
              leave; is
              not such a Bishop as much a <hi>carkass</hi>
              of a mortified
              Bishop, as those Congregations
              are the <hi>carkasses
              of mortified</hi>
            
            <hi>particular Churches,</hi>
              who have not all Episcopal Power
              exercised
              by their particular Pastors?
          </p>
          <p>
            Such kind of Arguments
              as these Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urges
              against Diocesan Episcopacy,
              but they return with greater
              force upon his new Form of Church-government by conjunct
              Pastors:
              for Superiority amongst Equals
              is
              liable to more inconveniences,
              and more objections,
              than different degrees
              and Orders
              of men
              in the same Church: and the reason
              is
              evident, why he rather chuses
              to have the Church governed
              by conjunct Pastors
              and a President, than to set an
              Independent Bishop over
            
            
            every particular Congregation, because he
              had
              a mind to counterfeit the Ancient
              Government by Bishop and Presbyters,
              (since he cannot deny that that
              was
              the Ancient Form of Government) without
              owning
              any distinct Orders
              in the Church: that those who are not aware of the Fallacy,
              may believe him
              to be as much for Episcopal precedency,
              as any man, till the Church of <hi>England</hi>
              were
              pulled
              down, and then his new project would be found
              unpracticable,
              and they must return to their Presbyterian parity again.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the same reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              sometimes
            
            pretends
              to be mightily
              for such Bishops
              as <hi>Ignatius</hi> was,
              who (he sayes)
              was
              Bishop but of one Congregation; and <hi>such
              Bishops
              we do not oppose:</hi> Now would Mr. <hi>B.</hi> stand to
              this, our Controversie
              about Diocesan Bishops
              were
              quickly
              at an
              end: for every one knows,
              that <hi>Ignatius</hi> challenged
              a Superiority
              of Order over Presbyters,
              and does,
              in all his Epistles,
              command them
              to be subject to their Bishops,
              and to attempt nothing without him:
              now let him
              allow but such Bishops
              as have subject Presbyters,
              and the Question
              about the Bounds
              and Extent of
            
            
            
            Bishopricks
              will be more easily
              determined:
              to be sure, he will never be able to prove that Diocesan
              Bishops
              are a new Species of Church-Officers,
              distinct from the <hi>Ignatian</hi>
              Bishops:
              <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Dallee,</hi> and others,
              were
              so sensible of this, that they used
              their utmost skill to prove those
              Epistles
              to be spurious, and since they have
              failed
              in that glorious attempt, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              had
              best try, whether he can make <hi>Ignatius</hi>
              his Bishops
              and Presbyters
              to be <hi>conjunct Pastors
              with a President Biship.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we see at last, what Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Parochial
              Episcopacy is,
              and how unlike
              Primitive Episcopacy, which unriddles
              that Mystery, why he should think Diocesan Episcopacy a new
              Species of
              Government from Parochial Episcopacy;
              which he every where charges
              upon the large extent of a Diocese, which, when it
              is
              too large, may occasion
              some defects
              in the exercise of Discipline,
              but cannot alter the Species of Government, while we retain
              the same degrees
              and orders
              of Governours
              in the Church; unless he thinks
              that a King, who has
              but a little Kingdom, does
              specifically
              differ from a King who
            
            
            governs
              a great many large and potent Kingdoms;
              whereas one may be as much a King as the other, though not
              so great and powerful a King: and the extent of
              Bishopricks
              being
              determined
              by no Divine Law, must be determined
              by Humane Prudence, and therefore the
              Bounds
              of Bishopricks
              seem to be a very slender pretence to
              justifie
              a Schism.
          </p>
          <p>But the plain truth is,
            Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Parochial
            Episcopacy does
            specifically
            differ from Diocesan Episcopacy, because a Parochial and
            Diocesan Bishop and Presbyters
            agree in nothing but in the Name: A Diocesan (or true
            primitive
            <hi>Ignatian)</hi> Bishop, has
            a Superiority
            of Order and Power over his Presbyters,
            who may advise him,
            but must be subject to him,
            and attempt nothing in Church-government without
            him;
            for which reason St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            excommunicated
            <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and his Confederates;
            but Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Parochial Presbyters
            have equal Authority with their President Bishop, who have no
            Priviledge
            above them,
            but to propose and moderate Debates,
            and number Votes,
            like the Chair-man of a Committee.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>This indeed is
            Mr. <hi>B's</hi> quarrel at Diocesan
            Episcopacy, though he layes
            the blame upon the Extent of a Diocese, which
            is
            a Popular pretence; but let us first be
            agreed
            about the nature of Episcopacy, and not be
            cheated
            again into a Presbyterian parity by
            an
            equivocal name,
            and then it will be time to discourse about the Extent of
            Bishopricks.</p>
          <p>And that I have not injured
            Mr. B. in representing
            his Opinion, let him
            speak his judgment
            himself in a few words.</p>
          <p>
            <hi>The number and need of the People</hi>
            
            <hi>must determine whether a particular Church shall have
              one Pastor or more:</hi> So that here may be a Parochial
              Bishop without either Presbyters
              or Deacons,
              a thing unknown in the primitive Church; and I need not tell
              you what kind of Bishop this is,
              <hi>viz.</hi> a Presbyterian
              or Independent Pastor of a single Congregation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <hi>If one for Concord be President to the rest, and the
              senior Pastors
              be guides
              to the younger,
              we are not against it.</hi> Here
              is
              his Description of a President Bishop, who, it
              seems,
              may be, or may not be, for there
              is
              no great need of him:
              and
            
            
            when he is
              made,
              it is
              for Concord not for Government, to be a Guide and Tutor to
              the young Bishops,
              though it be against the Apostolical Canon, to make such
              Novices
              Bishops
              as need Tutors.
          </p>
          <p><hi>Nor yet if the Magistrates
            or Churches,
            by consent, appoint some of the
            Graver
            to to be Visitors
            of many Churches,
            and to instruct and keep the younger
            in peace.</hi></p>
          <p><hi>Nor will we quarrel against the
            names
            of Bishops,
            or Arch-bishops,
            or their Wealth and Honour, while Faith, Worship,
            Discipline and
            Love are preserved.</hi></p>
          <p>These Visitors
            he sometimes
            calls
            Arch-bishops,
            sometimes
            <hi>Episcopi Episcoporum,</hi>
            Bishops
            of Bishops,
            which St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
            in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
            did
            reject with such abhorrence, as
            an
            injurious
            Usurpation upon the Office and Authority of a Bishop, and
            therefore this certainly
            can be no part of primitive
            Church-government.</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes
              he makes
              these Arch-Bishops
            
            Successors
              to the Apostles
              in the ordinary part of their Work and Office: and so indeed
              Bishops
              were
              alwayes
              accounted
              the Apostles
              Successors,
              and therefore were
              said
              to fit in the Apostles
              Chairs,
              but then they were
              such
            
            
            
            Bishops
              as had
              a Superiority of Order and Authority over their
              Presbyters
              and Deacons,
              without whose direction and allowance nothing might be
              done
              in Church-matters
              by the inferiour
              Clergy; and if he will allow these
              Arch-bishops
              to have such an
              inherent Apostolical Authority over
              Parish-Bishops,
              we will not dispute about words,
              but then he must not give away the full Episcopal power to
              his Parish-bishops.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this will not do Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s business, for this
              brings
              a Superiour
              Order into the Church, and destroys
              his darling Presbyterian Parity; and therefore he
              asserts,
              that such <hi>Arch-bishops
              as put down all the lower Bishops</hi>
              (i. e. the Parish-bishops)
              <hi>and govern the carkasses
              of the mortified
              particular Churches,
              as the lowest
              Bishops
              of many score, or hundred such as themselves,</hi> (that
              is,
              who exercise a true Episcopal Authority over these
              Parish-bishops,
              and their Churches)
              <hi>overthrow
              the Species</hi> (of Churches)
              <hi>of God's</hi>
            
            <hi>making.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore the safest
              way is
              to make these <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi>
              and <hi>Diocesans,</hi>
            
            <hi>and Patriarchs,
              the King's Officers,
              to exercise under him
              such Government of
            
            
            the Church as belongeth
              to Kings,</hi>
              (and therefore no proper Episcopal
              Jurisdiction,
              which does
              not belong to Kings)
              and then <hi>they will not quarrel at the name of
              Bishops
              or Arch-bishops:</hi>
              but our dissenting
              Brethren themselves will be contented
              to be made
              such Archi-episcopal
              Officers
              of the King; and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
              and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> are to be the two first,
              according
              to a late ingenious Proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus the whole matter is
              out, and it appears
              Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s great Art has
              been
              to confound his Readers
              with the names
              of Parochial Bishops,
              President Bishops,
              Arch-bishops,
              Patriarchs;
              when all that he means
              by it is
              this, that those whom
              we call Presbyters,
              are, and should be called
              Bishops,
              and have all that Authority, which, in primitive
              times,
              Bishops
              challenged,
              as a Superiour
              Order to Presbyters,
              though, for Concord-sake, five or six of
              them
              may be joyned
              together, and act as conjunct Pastors,
              with a Chair-man, who shall enjoy the name of President, and
              Ape the primitive Government of a Bishop with his
              Presbyters:
              and these are only
              proper Church-Officers,
              but the King, if he pleases,
              may delegate his
            
            
            
            Church-power to Church-men
              (as King <hi>H.</hi> 8. did
              to my Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
              his Vicar-general) and call them
              Diocesans,
              Arch-bishops,
              Patriarchs,
              or what he will.
          </p>
          <p>And yet, under this disguise, he
            thinks
            to conceal himself, and to play at Bo-peep with his
            Readers
            and Answerers:
            as to give one plain instance of this:</p>
          <p>
            The Dean charged
              him
              with asserting
              <hi>Congregational-Churches
              to be so much</hi>
            
            <hi>the Institution of Christ, that any other Constitution
              above these, is
              both unlawful
              and insupportable;</hi> for which he
              alledges
              his own words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Answer, cannot deny his own
              words,
              but endeavours
              to qualifie
              them:
              And first, he sayes,
              he did
              not absolutely
              assert it, but proposed
              it with an
              <hi>If: if it holdeth,
              that God Instituted
              only Congregational or Parochial
              Churches,
              as for present Communion,
              then none of the rest instituted
              by man may deprive them
              of their Priviledge
              granted
              by Christ: I put it but with an
              (if it be so) because I told
              them
              my own doubt of it. After that, I say, (to devise new
              Species of Churches
              without God's Authority, and impose
              them
              on the World,
            
            
            yea, in his name, and call all Dissenters
              Schismaticks,
              is
              worse Usurpation than to make and impose new
              Ceremonies
              and Liturgies)</hi>
              which are the words
              whereon the Dean had
              very justly
              founded
              his charge: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              thinks
              unjustly,
              because it
              was
              all qualified
              with an
              <hi>if,</hi> which expressed
              his doubt of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But at this rate, a man may fairly
              insinuate all the Villanous
              Accusations
              against Church and State, and bring himself as
              fairly
              off, though he do all the mischief with his <hi>If,</hi> as
              if he plainly
              asserted
              the thing: for when he first industriously
              proves,
              that <hi>all Churches,
              excepting
              Parochial, are of mens devising,
              considered
              as Churches;</hi>
              and though there may be some Arbitrary
              combinations
              of Parochial Churches,
              such as <hi>Classical, Diocesan, Metropolitical,
              Provincial,
              National, Patriarchal, Papal;</hi> yet they ought not to be
              accounted
              <hi>a distinct Policy, or Church-Form; for, it
              is
              perillous
              to give the same name to such an
              Assembly
              or Association, as to a Church of Christ's Institution, lest
              it seduce men
              to think that the word is
              not equivocally
              used;</hi>
              that is,
              to think, that these Associations
              are as true and proper Churches
              as Parochial Churches:
              I say, after
            
            
            
            all this, to argue from such premises
              with an
              <hi>if,</hi> does
              not signifie
              any doubt of the thing, but only a Form of
              arguing,
              and drawing
              Consequences
              from it: And thus it is
              plainly
              here: for he
            
            first proves,
              that Christ has
              instituted
              Congregational Churches
              for present Communion, and there
              is
              no other Form of Church-government, wherein present
              Communion can be had,
              according
              to his notion of it, which he every where
              inculcates,
              and which is
              the foundation of his whole <hi>Hypothesis;</hi>
              and he disputes
              at large, <hi>that the Presidents
              of all ranks
              of Synods,
              Classical,
              Diocesan, c.</hi> may be used
              <hi>as Presidents
              of Councils
              for concord,</hi> not <hi>as the</hi>
            
            pars Imperans, <hi>or constitutive Head of a distinct Church
              species:</hi> and then comes
              in his <hi>if,</hi> very opportunely,
              which no Body would guess did
              signifie
              his doubt of it, which he had
              so industriously
              proved,
              nor would any wise man go to draw
              conclusions,
              till he were
              well assured
              of the premises:
              and yet that Sentence which the Dean
              cited
              has
              no dependance
              at all on this <hi>If,</hi> it following
              three Sections
              after it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we will let this pass, as a hasty
              saying,
              and take no advantages
              of it,
            
            
            especially,
              since, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says,
              <hi>the Dean</hi>
            
            <hi>plainly
              confutes
              himself, and confesses,
              that he sayes,
              the Question is
              not whether the Arch-bishops
              should be over the particular Churches,
              as Successors
              to the Apostolical and General Overseers
              of the first Age, in the ordinary
              continued
              parts
              of their Office;
              nor whether Patriarchs,
              Diocesans,
              Lay-chancellors,
              as Officers
              of the King, exercising
              Magistracy, be lawful, and yet</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              complains)
              <hi>he</hi> (the Dean) <hi>saith,
              that I suppose the contrary;</hi> and well he might, not
              withstanding
              all this: for his Arch-bishops
              have no true Episcopal
              Authority over Parish Bishops,
              but are only <hi>Presidents
              of Councils
              for</hi>
            
            <hi>concord, not</hi> pars imperans, <hi>or the
              constitutive
              Heads
              of a distinct Church-species;</hi> and his
              Diocesans
              are not Church-Officers,
              but the King's Ministers
              in Church-Affairs;
              and therefore his evasion lies
              only in the Equivocal use of the name of
              Arch-bishops
              and Diocesan Bishops:
              and he does
              expresly
              assert, in the very same place, in answer to the Dean's
              false Accusation, that such Bishops
              as the Dean means,
              that is,
              such Diocesan Bishops,
              as the Church of <hi>England</hi>
              acknowledges,
              does
              overthrow the Church-species of God's
              making,
              and is
            
            
            
            therefore unlawful. He sayes
              indeed, that <hi>Arch-bishops,
              which are over the lower
              Bishops,
              do not overthrow it,</hi> that is,
              his President Arch-bishops,
              who only preside
              for Concord in the Council of Bishops,
              but have no governing
              power and Authority: <hi>But those</hi>
              (Arch-bishops,
              by us called
              Diocesan Bishops)
              <hi>that put them
              all</hi> (the lower, or Parochial
              Bishops,
              otherwise called
              <hi>Presbyters)
              down, and govern the carkasses
              of the mortified
              particular Churches,
              as the lowest
              Bishops
              of many score or hundred such as themselves;</hi> that
              is,
              who take away Episcopal power, from the
              Ministers
              of single Congregations,
              and exercise
              Episcopal Authority over them,
              who are as good men,
              and as much Bishops
              as themselves: these are the men,
              who overthrow the Church-species of Christ's Institution,
              that is,
              Parochial Churches,
              by setting
              Presbyters
              over them
              instead of Bishops.
              So that the Dean charged
              him
              with nothing but what he himself
              expresly
              owns,
              that the <hi>English</hi> Diocesan Episcopacy
              destroyes
              the Church-species of Christ's Institution,
              and therefore is
              unlawful, and a worse Usurpation than to make or
              impose new
              Ceremonies
              or Liturgies.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>The observing
            this one thing, spoils
            all the Evasions
            and Fallacies,
            which are the great strength and support of his Cause; and it
            is
            to no purpose for him
            to amuse the World any longer
            with the name of Bishops,
            Arch-bishops,
            Metropolitans,
            <hi>c.</hi> when the Dispute
            is
            no more but this, whether every Presbyter be a primitive and
            Apostolical Bishop, the old Pleas
            for Presbytery or Independency being
            new furbished
            up, and recommended
            with the flattering
            Title of Parochial Episcopacy;
            and Presbyterian Classes,
            and Provincial and National Synods,
            with their Prolocutors
            or Presidents,
            must pass for Arch-bishops;
            and thus Diocesan
            Episcopacy must be removed
            to make room for Presbyterian Episcopacy.</p>
          <p>
            This also is
              the occasion of that hot Dispute
              concerning
              the ancient extent of Bishopricks;
              that a Bishop had
              but one single Congregation under his Cure: now,
              were
              it possible for Mr. B. to prove this, (which
              is
              so contrary to all the Records
              of Church-history) what Service
              would it do him?
              Why then it is
              plain, that every Parish Minister
              is
              a Bishop. But how does
              this follow? In the
            
            
            
            first Ages
              of Christianity, a Bishop had
              no more Souls
              under his Care and Government,
              than are at this day in some Parishes
              in <hi>London,</hi> therefore every Parish Minister
              is
              a Bishop: but is
              this a good Argument? Some Generals
              have had
              no more Souldiers
              in their whole Army, than some Colonels
              now have under their Command, and therefore those
              Collonels
              were
              Generals.
              Whatever the
              extent of ancient Bishopricks
              was,
              every Bishop had
              his Presbyters
              and Deacons
              under him;
              and though a Bishop should intrust a Presbyter now with the
              particular care of as many Souls,
              as some Bishops
              had
              or have in their whole Diocese, this
              does
              not make such a Presbyter a Bishop, for he must act still in
              the Order of a Presbyter, not of a Bishop; the Episcopal
              Office includes
              an
              Authority over Presbyters,
              and the inferiour
              Clergy, as well as over the People: and when this
              is
              once acknowledged,
              we will dispute the extent
              of Bishopricks
              with them,
              and try whether inlarging
              or lessening
              the bounds
              of Bishopricks
              can make a new distinct Species of Church-government. We
              acknowledge <hi>the retrenchment of
              Dioceses,
              by the multiplication of Suffragan
            
            
            Bishops,
              a thing very reconcileable with the Honour of the
              Reformation</hi> (as a late civil
              <hi>Reflexion</hi>
              on the Dean, who
            
            calls
              himself a <hi>Conformist,</hi> is
              pleased
              to term it) but we deny, that the
              diminution
              of the Episcopal Authority, or bringing
              a Presbyterian parity into the Church, under the notion of
              Parochial Episcopacy, is
              so reconcileable with the Honour of the Reformation; a
              Notion which that wise Author has
              learn'd of Mr. B. and either out of
              ignorance,
              or inclination to Presbytery, swallows
              very glibly,
              and thinks
              it an
              admirable Vindication of Mr. B's esteem for Episcopacy,
              which is
              such a reduction
              of primitive Episcopacy, as it was
              of Regal power, to place the Sovereign Authority of
              Kings,
              Lords
              and Commons,
              in a Rump Parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is
              one considerable advantage indeed, which the Dean
              has
              taken
              from Mr. B's concession of <hi>Arch-bishops,
              that</hi>
            
            <hi>is,
              Bishops
              that have oversight of many Churches
              with their Pastors,
              as lawful Successors
              of the Apostles
              in the ordinary part of their work,</hi> for the Vindication
              of our <hi>English</hi> Episcopacy, and
              argues
              thus; <hi>That which is
              only a continuance of the same kind of
              Churches,
              which were
            
            
            
            in Being
              in the Apostolical times,
              is
              no devising
              a new Species of Churches,
              nor hath
              any thing repugnant to any Institution
              of Christ: but that is
              the case, as to our Episcopacy. We intend no quarrel about
              names:
              if it be Mr.</hi> B' <hi>s pleasure to call our
              Bishops
              Arch-bishops,
              let him
              enjoy his own fancy. It already
              appears
              from St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and might much more be
              made
              plain from many others, if it were
              needful, that the Bishops
              of several Churches
              were
              looked
              on as Successors
              to the Apostles,
              in the care and Government of Churches.
              Now the Office of Mr.</hi> B' s <hi>Parochial
              Bishops
              was
              only to attend to one particular Congregation; but the
              Apostolical
              Office was
              above this, while the Apostles
              held
              it in their own hands;
              and did
              not make a new Species of Churches,
              nor overthrow the constitution of
              Parochial
              Churches.
              It seems
              then a strange thing to me, that the continuance of the same
              kind of Office in the Church, should be
              called
              the devising
              a new Species of Churches:</hi>
              and that our Bishops,
              according
            
            to the Constitution of our Church, do succeed the
              Apostles
              in the ordinary parts
              of their Apostolical Authority, he
              proves
              at large in some following
              pages.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            Now here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is
              taken,
              and knows
              not how to disintangle
              himself, but makes
              some faint offers
              at it. And first,
            
            he endeavours
              to make some advantage from the Dean's
              <hi>giving
              him
              leave to call our Bishops
              Arch-bishops:</hi>
              which the Dean we see very civilly
              did
              to prevent
              wrangling
              about words;
              But now he has
              leave to call them
              Arch-bishops,
              he won't do it, but proves
              that they are no Arch-bishops,
              for <hi>Arch-bishops
              have Churches
              with their proper Bishops
              under them;
              but our Bishops
              say, that there are no such under
              them;</hi>
              i. e. our Bishops
              can't be Arch-bishops
              unless every Parochial Minister be a Bishop. Nor
              does
              the Dean say, this is
              a proper name for them:
              and, as to humour him,
              he gave
              him
              leave to call Bishops
              Arch-bishops,
              so if that will please him,
              he may call Presbyters
              Bishops
              too, so he will but own them
              subject to a Superiour
              Apostolical Authority, now residing
              in Diocesan Bishops
              or Arch-bishops.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he answers,
              secondly,
              <hi>I told
              you before, that as the Major General,
              Quartermaster
              General,</hi> c. <hi>of an
              Army, constituteth
              not a distinct body from the Army, and the particular
              Regiments
              and Troops,
            
            
            
            so I am
              not certain, that Apostles
              or Evangelists,
              or any general Preachers,
              as such, did
              constitute any Church-Form distinct from the
              Catholick
              and the particular Bishops
              Churches:
              but if they are supposed
              to have taken
              their several fixed
              Provinces
              (which I never saw
              proved)
              I will not contend whether those
              Provinces
              may be called
              Churches;
              if we agree about the thing, use the name as you see
              cause.</hi> This is
              very surprizing,
              he dares
              not deny the Apostolical Authority over
              Bishops,
              and was
              ashamed
              to deny what he had
              so lately
              granted,
              that the ordinary parts
              of the Apostolical Authority might still be
              conveyed
              to some Churches
              Officers,
              to oversee and govern Pastors
              as well as People: and he had
              no mind now to dispute, whether that
              Authority
              which we ascribe to our Bishops
              be any other than this Apostolical
              Authority,
              and therefore now all that he has
              to say, is,
              <hi>that he is
              not certain, that Apostles,
              or Evangelists,
              or general Preachers,
              as such,</hi> (but we speak not now of general
              Preachers,
              as such, but of Superiour
              Governours)
              <hi>did
              constitute any Church-Form distinct from the
              Catholick
              and the particular Bishops
              Churches.</hi>
              Wonderful!
              He disputes
              against Diocesan
            
            
            Episcopacy, because this is
              to make a new Form and Species of
              Churches,
              of man's devising;
              the Dean proves,
              that this is
              not making,
              or devising,
              a new Church-species or Form, but
              onely
              the exercise of that Apostolical Authority, which, he
              allows,
              may be lawfully
              exercised
              in the Church, and now he will not allow it to be any
              Church-Form at all: however, if it be none, we gain thus
              much by it, that it is
              not a new one, of man's devising;
              and therefore not unlawful, but such as they ought to submit
              to, and we will dispute it no farther.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet it is
              strange, if Ecclesiastical power and authority
              is
              so essential to the nature and Being
              of a Church, (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              perpetually
              insists
              on, to prove, that we un-church all
              Parochial
              Churches,
              by denying
              them
              full power of Discipline and Government) that
              Churches
              should be formed
              with respect to an
              inferiour,
              and not to the Supreme power of the Church;
              methinks
              the Argument holds
              stronger
              the other way, according
              to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own principles;
              that, if no Society be a compleat
              Church, which has
              not all Ecclesiastical power in it self necessary
            
            
            
            to Church-government, then no Church
              is
              a compleat
              and perfect Church which wants
              Apostolical Authority, which is
              the highest
              power in the Church, and can controul
              any Inferiour
              degree of Power; and thus his lower Parochial
              Bishops
              cannot constitute a complete Church, as not
              having
              Apostolical Authority;
              but a Diocesan Church, which has
              this Authority, is
              the first complete and perfect Church.
          </p>
          <p>And it is
            stranger still, that the Apostles
            should be the first Founders
            of Churches,
            and the Supreme Governours
            of them,
            and yet the Apostolical Authority
            not constitute any Church-Form: which
            is
            as much as to say, that the Supreme Authority in the Church
            is
            no part of its
            Form or Government, that Kingly power
            is
            not essential to the notion of a Kingdom.</p>
          <p>
            But that which has
              bewildred
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is,
              that he cannot find an
              Apostolical Church distinct from all the particular
              Churches
              founded
              by the Apostles;
              and I should greatly
              wonder, if he could: and therefore to unriddle this Mystery
              to him,
              and to let him
              see, how Apostolical
              Authority goes
              to the Constitution
              of a Church, I observe, that the
            
            
            Apostolical Authority did
              concur to the nature and form of those
              Churches
              which were
              founded
              by the Apostles,
              which were
              not compleat
              Churches
              without it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though the Apostles
              did
              not always
              reside in one Church, as fixed
              Bishops,
              yet they kept
              the Supreme power of Government in their own
              hands:
              they ordained
              Elders,
              who were
              subject to their command, they gave
              Rules
              of Discipline, and gave
              Orders
              and Authority
              for executing
              Church-censures,
              as they saw
              occasion; they sent
              Letters
              or Evangelists
              to put their Directions
              in practise, as is
              evident from the History
              of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and those many
              Letters
              he wrote
              to the several Churches,
              founded
              and governed
              by him;
              so that the Apostles
              were
              the Supreme Governours
              of the Churches
              they founded,
              which is
              the reason why it is
              probable, as the Dean observes,
              <hi>that while the Apostles
              lived
              there were
              no fix'd Bishops,
              or very few, for they managed
              the Affairs
              of Government themselves: but as they
              withdrew,
              they did,
              in some Churches
              sooner,
              in some later,
              as their own continuance, the condition of the
              Churches,
              and the qualification</hi>
            
            <hi>of the Persons
              were,
              commit the
            
            
            
            care and Government of Churches
              to such Persons
              whom
              they appointed
              thereto.</hi> And Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
              Exceptions
              against this are very mean; as first, <hi>that then, while
              they</hi> (the
            
            Apostles)
              <hi>lived,
              there were
              but twelve or thirteen Bishops
              in the World, if any: and were
              there no more Churches
              in the World that had
              Pastors?</hi>
              Yes, they had
              all Pastors,
              as our Churches
              now have, besides
              the Bishops,
              but the Supreme Governing-power
              was
              in their own hand. 2. <hi>Then if it
              cannot be
              proved
              that the Apostles
              were
              fixed
              Bishops,
              there were
              none in the World in their times:</hi>
              that is
              not said,
              that there were
              none during all the Apostles
              times;
              for it is
              evident, St. <hi>James,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
              was
              a fixed
              Bishop from the beginning;
              but they were
              planted
              by degrees,
              as their absence, or the occasions
              of the Church required.
              Thus, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> went
              to <hi>Rome, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and, it
              is
              not improbable, many others, were
              ordained
              Bishops,
              and left behind him:
              And what if there were
              no fixed
              Bishops
              in those dayes,
              when this want was
              supplied
              by the infinite
              diligence of the Apostles,
              in travelling,
              writing,
              sending
              Messengers
              and Evangelists
              from one Church to
            
            
            another, and by those miraculous
              gifts
              with which the Christian Churches
              were
              enriched
              in those dayes.
          </p>
          <p>
            He seems
              to prove something, though I know well what, in what
              follows;
              <hi>If the Apostles
              were
              not fixed
              Bishops
              of any single Churches,
              they have no Successors,
              as such; if they were,
              we must have but twelve or thirteen
              Bishops,
              as their Successors
              in the World; and which be those
              Seats,
              and how prove they their claim?</hi> But
              did
              not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> acknowledge, that the ordinary
              governing
              power of the Apostles
              might lawfully
              be continued
              in the Church; to what purpose then
              does
              this serve, to prove that there must be none, or that they
              can be but thirteen such Apostolical
              Arch-bishops?
              Our Saviour thought twelve or thirteen
              Apostles
              sufficient to plant the Christian Church, but more
              Apostolical Governours
              may be necessary for the Encrease
              and Government of it, esgecially when those extraordinary
              Apostolical Gifts
              ceased,
              though the ordinary power remained:
              and therefore, what inconvenience
              there can be to say, that the Apostles
              appointed
              particular Bishops
              their Successors
              in the care of particular
              Churches,
              not as Successors
              to their
            
            
            
            whole Apostolical Office, I cannot
              imagine.
          </p>
          <p>By this time, I hope, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can tell how the
            Apostolical authority may constitute
            a Church Form, without finding
            a Church distinct from the Catholick,
            or particular Bishops
            Churches,
            or dividing
            the whole Church into Apostolical
            Provinces.
            But, the truth is,
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
            granted
            more than will consist with the Defence of his Cause, in
            acknowledging
            such Arch-bishops
            as are the Apostles
            Successors
            in the ordinary parts
            of Apostolical Authority; for he never
            designed
            any more than a President Arch-bishop: but the Dean
            has
            unmercifully
            taken
            him
            at an
            advantage, and proved
            that an
            Apostolical Successor is
            somewhat more than a President, even such very
            Creatures
            as Diocesan Bishops,
            and he can neither go safely
            forward, nor make an
            honourable Retreat.</p>
          <p>
            This possibly
              will be thought a long digression, though it
              is
              more to the purpose
              than every one may be aware of: for my business
              was
              to shew,
              that the bounds
              and extents
              of Bishopricks
              not being
              determined
              by a Divine Law, while the Church
              is
              governed
              according
            
            
            to the ancient Form, by Church-governours
              of Divine or Apostolical Institution, such as
              Bishops,
              Priests,
              and Deacons;
              a small or larger
              Diocese, whatever other faults
              it may have, cannot
              make a new Form or Species of Church-government, as Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> affirms,
              in contradiction of the sense of
              mankind, and
              there was
              no such effectual way to detect his
              Fallacies,
              as by making
              it appear, that his Quarrel was
              not so much against the extent of
              Dioceses,
              as against the primitive Apostolical Form of Episcopacy it
              self, though he endeavours
              to palliate it with an
              equivocal Use
              of the names
              Bishops,
              Arch-bishops,
              c.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, to proceed, the combination of Neighbour Diocesan
              Churches,
              for the preservation of Catholick
              Unity, and the more regular administration of Discipline, by
              mutual advice and Counsel,
              into Archiepiscopal, National, Patriarchal
              Churches,
              though it be not founded
              on any express Divine Law, yet is
              warranted
              by our obligations
              to Catholick
              Unity: For, if there be but one
              Catholick
              Church, and one Catholick
              Communion, all Churches
              must live in Communion with each other,
            
            
            
            and therefore more especially
              Neighbour
              Churches,
              whose very Neighbourhood
              makes
              them
              more capable of a mutual discharge of those Christian
              Offices
              wherein Christian Communion consists,
              than those at a greater
              distance are.
          </p>
          <p>For this reason, I cannot but
            wonder, when I
            hear men
            demand a proof of the Divine Institution of National
            Churches,
            which seems
            to me, as if they should demand a proof of the divine
            Institution of Catholick
            Communion: for the common reason of mankind will conclude,
            that if all Churches
            are bound
            to live in Communion with each other, Neighbour
            Churches
            ought to unite into as large Bodies,
            and into as large Bodies,
            and into as strict Confederacies
            and Combinations,
            as will serve and promote the ends
            of Catholick
            Communion, and that this is
            not only lawful, but a necessary duty.</p>
          <p>
            Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself distinguishes
              between
              <hi>humane terms
              of Communion,</hi> and
            
            <hi>humane acts,</hi>
              which are onely
              <hi>the circumstantiating
              a known
              duty,</hi> such <hi>as holding
              Christian love and concord,</hi> and upon this account
              dares
              not wholly
              reject those Church-Forms,
              called
              <hi>Classical, Metropolitical,
              c.</hi> though he is
              not willing
            
            
            to call them
              <hi>Church-Forms.</hi>
              Now if it will be acknowledged,
              that <hi>Catholick
              Communion</hi> is
              a necessary duty, (which, I hope, I have
              sufficiently
              proved)
              then the Combination of Diocesan
              Churches
              into greater
              Bodies,
              for the preservation of Catholick
              Communion,
              is
              only the circumstantiating
              a known
              duty, by <hi>humane acts,</hi>
              and therefore not only lawful, but, in some sense,
              necessary, as being
              only the application
              of a divine Law to particular Cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the same purpose Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
              discourses
              at large, concerning
              the Use of the <hi>directive light of nature,</hi> in
              forming
              Churches,
              and determining
              the External
              circumstances
              of Worship: and concludes
              in express words,
              <hi>the things
              themselves</hi>
            
            <hi>being
              divinely
              instituted,
              are capable of
              such general directions
              in and by the light of Nature, as may, with ordinary
              Christian Prudence, be on all occasions
              applied
              unto the Use and Practise of the Church.</hi> And from this
              principle he endeavours
              to prove the divine origiginal
              of Congregational Churches,
              of which more hereafter. And from hence I as
              fairly
              argue, that if Catholick
              Communion be
              a divine Institution, <hi>it is
            
            
            
            capable of such directions,
              as may, with ordinary
              Christian Prudence, be applied
              unto the Use and Practise of the Church:</hi> and if
              Archiepiscopal and National Churches
              will serve the end of Catholick
              Communion,
              such Confederacies
              of Churches
              have as much a divine Institution, as Dr.
              <hi>Owen</hi>'s
              Congregational Churches;
              especially
              since <hi>Dr. O.</hi> expresly
              affirms,
              <hi>that whatever is
              required
              by the light of</hi>
            
            <hi>Nature, in such Societies
              as Churches,
              as useful to their Order, and conducing
              to their end, is
              a divine Institution;</hi> and, if
              complying
              with the directions
              of the Light of Nature, can make a divine
              Institution
              in Church-Societies,
              much more will an
              express Law of <hi>Catholick
              Communion</hi> justifie
              the combination of particular Churches
              into larger
              Bodies
              or Church-Societies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon this Principle, as it is
              probable, the
              Ancient Church, instituted
              Meropolitan
            
            Bishopricks,
              which some derive
              from the very times
              of the Apostles,
              not without some good Appearance
              of Reason; at least, they were
              so Ancien_,
              that we cannot trace the Original
              of them:
              and, I confess, it seems
              very harsh to me, to attribute the
              universal
              Practise of the Church, while it
            
            
            was
              in a state of Suffering
              and Persecution,
              when they renounced
              all the present
              advantages
              of this Life for the sake of their Religion, to no better
              Original than
              Pride, and Ambition, and Worldly
              reasons.
              But some men
              care not how they reproach the purest
              and most Apostolical Churches,
              and therein,
              Christianity it self, if they can but be
              revenged
              of the Carnal, worldlyminded
              Church-men
              of this Age, who stand in the way of their Ambition.

          <head type="sub">What that Communion
            is,
            which is
            essential to
            particular, or Diocesan Churches.</head>
          <p>IT is
            time now to apply this Doctrine of <hi>one
            Catholick
            Communion,</hi> to the several Forms
            or distinctions
            of Churches,
            and to those particular acts
            of Christian
            Communion peculiar to each of them,
            and I shall confine my self to these three
            kinds
            of Churches,
            (if they may be so called)
            the particular, or Diocesan
            Church, the National Church, and the Universal Church.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>I shall begin with a particular, or Diocesan Church; for I
            must own, that Parochial Congregations
            have not the complete essence of a Church,
            because they have
            not full power of Discipline
            and Government within themselves,
            but are parts
            of the Diocesan Church.</p>
          <p>
            Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
              and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> both agree in this, that local,
              presential Communion
              is
              essential to the constitution of a particular Church-state,
              and they allow no other Church-form to be of divine
              Institution, but where all the Members
              of it may enjoy <hi>present Communion:</hi> there
              is
              indeed some little difference between Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in stating
              the Notion of present Communion: <hi>Dr.
              Owen</hi>
              is
              for such a Church, wherein
              all the Members
              may enjoy <hi>Communion</hi>
              in all acts
              of Worship as well as Discipline, which
              is
              the true notion of
            
            of a Congregational Church, which
              is
              a Church consisting
              of one worshipping
              Assembly
              or Congregation: Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              enlarges
              the notion of <hi>presential Communion;</hi>
              and will allow a Church to consist of several
              worshipping
              Congregations,
              which may by turns
              communicate
              with one another, and their Head
            
            
            Bishop or Pastor; if they keep within such
              numbers
              and distance, that they may be capable of a Pastoral
              inspection
              and discipline, as I observed
              before: but this has
              not alwayes
              been
              Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Judgment;
              for he has
              formerly
              declared,
              that he <hi>never dissented
              from those called
              Congregational in</hi> England, <hi>in the two great
              Points
              from which their Churches
              are denominated,</hi>
              viz. 1. <hi>That regularly
              they should consist but of so many as are capable of
              personal Communion, which they call a Congregation. 2. And
              that this congregation is
              not,</hi> jure divino, <hi>under</hi>
            
            <hi>the spiritual Government of any
              Superiour
              Church, as Metropolitan, Patriarchal,</hi>
              c. Now a <hi>Congregational,
              Personal
              Communion</hi> extends
              but to one Congregation, not to many, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              extends
              his <hi>present Communion,</hi>
              being
              for_'d,
              it seems,
              at last, to acknowledge, that, in primitive
              times,
              a particular Church did
              consist of more Congregations
              than one; and for the same reason,
              forced
              to quit a <hi>presential, Congregational
              Communion:</hi> though indeed, upon a perusal of Dr.
              <hi>O</hi>'s Answer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> I find he
              is
              forced
              also to allow some such thing, that <hi>de facto</hi> it
              was
              so, though he is
              not willing to
            
            
            
            allow the fitness of it, while the thing may be
              palliated
              by a slender excuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shall begin with a consideration of <hi>Dr. O</hi>'s
              proofs
              for the divine Institution
              of such Congregational Churches,
              wherein all the Members
              enjoy local, and presential Communion,
              according
              to that definition he gives
              of a Church. And the <hi>Dr.</hi>
              argues
              from three general
            
            Topicks,
              which, I confess, are of that weight and moment, that if any
              one of them
              hold good, I will yield the Cause. 1. From the
              <hi>appointment of Christ:</hi> which he
              disputes
              at large in Chapt. 4. 2. <hi>From the state of the first
              Churches
              after the Apostles,
              to the end of the second Century.</hi> chap. 5. 3. From the
              nature of <hi>congregational Churches,
              which alone are suited
              unto the ends
              of Christ, in the Institution of his Church,</hi> ch. 6. The
              first and third, as the Dr. has
              managed
              them,
              seem very coincident, but where they are capable of a
              distinct consideration,
              they shall have it.
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. Let us consider how he
            proves
            Congregational Churches
            to be of Christ's appointment and Institution, and he
            uses
            three Arguments
            to this purpose.</p>
          <p n="1">
            
            
            1. His first Argument pretends
              only to prove, what Christ should have
              done
              according
              to his opinion of the case, not what Christ
              has
              done.
              For thus he argues;
              <hi>Christ appointed
              that Church-state which is
              meet and accommodated
              unto all the ends
              which he designed
              in his Institution of a Church; but such
              alone
              is
              that Church, Form, and Order</hi>
            
            <hi>we have proposed;
              i. e.</hi> A Congregational
              Church, for local and presential Communion: and the special
              ends
              he assigns
              of Christ's instituting
              a Church-State, are, 1. <hi>The
              professed
              Subjection of the Souls
              and Consciences
              of Believers
              unto his Authority
              in the Observance of his Commands.
              2. The joynt
              Celebration of all Gospel Ordinances
              and Worship. 3. The Exercise and Preservation of Discipline;
              1. For the preservation of the Doctrine of the Gospel, in
              it's Purity and Obedience unto the
              Commands
              of Christ in it's Integrity:
              2. To preserve Love entire among his
              Disciples:
              3. That it might be a due Representation of his own Love,
              Care, Tenderness,
              Patience, Meekness, in the acting
              of his Authority in the Church. 4. To be
              an
              Evidence and Pledge of the future
              Judgment.</hi>
              And he adds,
              <hi>It is
              in Congregational
              Churches
              alone, that these things
            
            
            
            can be done
              and observed;
              for unto all of them
              are required
              Assemblies
              of the whole Church.</hi> This is
              the whole Strength of his Argument, to prove that Christ
              has
              instituted
              Congregational Churches.
              To which I answer,
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. That I do not much like the way of
            arguing,
            for, 1. it seems
            a little too bold and peremptory, to determine what Christ
            must do, for, whatever his ends
            were
            in the Institution of a Church, we cannot say; but the eternal
            Wisdom of the
            Father had
            more ways
            than one to accomplish those ends:
            and I would not undertake to prescribe what infinite Wisdom
            must do, but rather consider what
            is
            done.</p>
          <p n="2">
            2. It gives
              an
              endless Scope to every man's Fancy, to model
              Churches
              according
              to their own Humours,
              and then grow fond of their Dreams,
              and then think it best at least, that it should be so; and
              thence conclude, that God who always
              does
              what is
              best, hath
              appointed,
              that it shall be so. Thus the Papists
              conceive it the most effectual way to preserve the Unity of
              the Church, the Purity of Doctrine, the Exercise of
              Discipline, <hi>c.</hi> that there should be one
              supreme infallible Head
            
            
            and Monarch of the Church; and thence
              confidently
              conclude, that Christ has
              ordained
              such a Head, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
              is
              the man. This is
              a way of arguing,
              that any men
              may make use of, and though possibly
              all men
              may not argue with the same Appearance of Reason, to equal
              Judges,
              yet there are so many specious things
              to be said
              on all sides,
              in this way, that every man will be left to judge
              according
              to his own Inclinations,
              which is
              never likely to end a Controversie.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. Our Saviour in his own Person
            instituted
            no particular Form of Churches
            at all, but only sent
            forth his Apostles
            to convert men
            to the Faith, and to form them
            into a Church-Society; so that we cannot plead the immediate
            Institution or Appointment of Christ one way or other, unless
            we can spell out any particular Church-form in that general
            Commission, which Christ gave
            to his Apostles,
            and I doubt that will not look very like a Congregational
            Church.</p>
          <p n="3">
            3. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> fails
              in enumerating
              the ends
              for which Christ instituted
              his Church, for he has
              left out the principal
            
            
            
            end of all, which was,
              <hi>to unite all Believers
              in one Body to Christ, their Head.</hi> The great Mystery of
              Christianity
              consists
              in our Union to Christ, whereby we are
              made
              partakers
              of all the Benefits
              and Blessings
              which he hath
              purchased
              by his Sufferings
              and Death: now our Union to Christ
              is
              by our Incorporation into his <hi>Church,</hi> which
              is
              his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Spouse,</hi> which he purchas'd
              by his own Blood, governs
              by his Spirit, and will finally
              bring to Glory: to be a visible
              Member of this
              Church, is
              necessary to entitle
              us to the external Communion and
              Priviledges
              of it; and our Lord commands,
              that all his true and sincere Disciples,
              should be united
              in external and visible Communion, which
              nothing will
              excuse them
              from, while it may be lawfully
              had;
              so that the Christian
              Church is
              founded
              upon that Covenant,
              which Christ purchased
              with his Blood, and administers
              by the power of
              his Intercession; and the Reason of
              instituting
              this Church, is
              to give us an
              Interest in the Merits
              and Intercession
              of our Saviour, which none can have any Interest in, but
              those who are Members
              of his Body, that is,
              of his
            
            
            Church; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              makes
              the Union between Christ and his Church, to be a very great
              Mystery, like being
              made
              Flesh of his Flesh, and
            
            Bone of his Bone. The nature and
              Essence of the
              Church does
              not consist in religious Assemblies,
              but in it's Union to Christ, as Head of the body; all the
              acts
              of Christian Worship, and holding
              Assemblies
              for religious Worship, is
              a necessary Church-duty, wherein our visible Communion with
              Christ consists;
              but it is
              a Covenant-relation to Christ, which
              constitutes
              the Church, and therefore it is
              unreasonable to deduce
              a Church-form, merely
              from the Consideration of worshipping
              Assemblies,
              which are a necessary duty indeed
              of Church-Society, but are consequent
              to the Constitution of a Church, and do not include the
              whole nature of it: as to give some plain
              Instances
              of this, whereby every one may better understand what I
              mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Church which is
              united
              to Christ, by a Covenant-relation,
              is
              but <hi>one Body;</hi> for Christ
              has
              but one Body and one Spouse, as I have already
              proved
              at large, and therefore, particular
              Churches
              must be formed
              not only with
            
            
            
            respect to the conveniency of religious
              Assemblies,
              but to Catholick
              Unity, which is
              a plain demonstration, that the nature of particular
              Churches
              cannot be
              confined
              to Independent Congregations,
              which are distinct, intire,
              complete Churches
              in themselves, without
              any relation to other Churches,
              but what is
              owing
              to voluntary Compacts
              and Confederations,
              which any Church may refuse, that
              pleases;
              much less can it be thought destructive to the
              Being
              of a Church, to be larger
              than a single Congregation, when the whole
              Christian
              Church is
              but one Body and Society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus if the Church be united
              to Christ, by a Convenant-relation,
              and this Union to Christ makes
              it a Church, then the nature of a Church
              does
              not consist in a Church-Covenant between such a particular
              Pastor and People, and of one Member with another. If Christ
              be our Head, the great Bishop and
              Shepheard
              of Souls,
              all Church Authority
              must be derived
              from him,
              and the relation of People to their
              Pastors,
              must be founded
              on that Authority they receive from Christ: for none can
              give Power, but he who has
              it; none
            
            
            can be a Christian who does
              not submit to
              the Authority of Christ, and therefore this Authority
              is
              antecedent to the forming
              of a Church, and not a consequent act of the Church it self;
              for nothing can be more wild than to think, that the
              authority of Government
              resides
              in those who are to be governed;
              when the Society does
              not depend upon any Humane acts
              and compacts,
              but on a divine Covenant,
              and therefore requires
              a Divine authority to admit men
              into this Covenant:
              Thus we know Christ ordained
              his Apostles,
              committed
              to them
              the power of the Keys,
              and gave
              them
              authority to preach the Gospel, and to incorporate all
              Believers
              into the Church by Baptism, in order to the
              forming
              of Church-Society; and that distinction Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              makes
              between <hi>extraordinary Officers</hi>
              (such as the Apostles)
            
            <hi>whose Office and Power is
              antececedent
              to the Church, and those ordinary
              Officers,
              unto whose Office and Power the Church
              essentially
              considered
              is
              antecedent,</hi>
              is
              a mere evasion, to render a successive communication of
              Power from Christ to Church-Officers,
              needless, and
              to invest the People with a
            
            
            
            power of choosing
              and ordaining
              their own Pastors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The extraordinary Officers,
              he sayes,
              ceased
              with the Apostles,
              and <hi>nothing is
              more vain than to pretend any succession</hi>
            
            <hi>unto them,
              in the whole, or any part of their Office:</hi> If the
              Apostolical Office, in every part of it,
              ceased
              with the Apostles,
              how does
              Christ make good his promise to
              them,
              <hi>Lo, I am
              with you alway, even to the end of the</hi>
            
            <hi>world?</hi> Which must refer, not to the
              Persons
              of the Apostles,
              who were
              to live but a little while, but to
              them
              and their Successors
              in their Office and Ministry, which
              was
              to continue alway,
              if Christ promised
              to be alway with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what was
              that Apostolical Office which is
              now ceased?
              He will not surely
              call extraordinary Gifts
              and miraculous
              Powers,
              and divine Inspiration, the Apostolical Office; for in that
              Age of Miracles
              all this was
              common to others besides
              the Apostles,
              and continued
              in the Church after their decease. Nor
              is
              an
              immediate Commission from Christ
              an
              extraordinary Office, but only an
              extraordinary way of conveying
              that Office and Power; and as for
            
            
            the <hi>extent of their Commission,
              giving
              them
              power towards
              all the world for their conversion, and over all
              Churches
              for their edification,</hi> I do not see but that every
              Gospel Bishop or Pastor has
              as extensive a Commission; for we are
              Ministers
              of the Catholick
              Church, though the exercise of our Ministry be more
              peculiarly
              confined
              to a certain
              place, for the better edification of that Church: and we
              have the same Authority, though not the same
              Command,
              because not the same Qualifications,
              to preach the Gospel to <hi>Jews,
              Turks,</hi>
              and <hi>Heathens,</hi>
              whom
              we may still convert to Christianity, and
              receive into
              the Church, as we have opportunity
              to do it: Those indeed who have no other authority but what
              they receive from the choice of a
              particular
              Congregation, are not Ministers
              of the Catholick
              Church, but those who receive their authority by a
              Succession
              from the Apostles
              are; for they are the Ministers
              of any particular Congregation.
              So that nothing extraordinary in the
              Apostles
              was
              the Apostolical Office
              and Power, but only an
              extraordinary
              manner of discharging
              this Office,
            
            
            
            suitable to their extraordinary
              Endowments,
              and necessary to the first forming
              of a church: but to preach the Gospel, to baptise those who
              believe, to
              consecrate the Eucharist, to govern the Church; in a word,
              the power of the Keys,
              to receive in, and to shut out of the Church,
              is
              the Apostolical
              Office and Power which every
              Bishop enjoyes
              in as ample manner as the Apostles
              did;
              and therefore were
              alway in the primitive Church acknowledged
              for the Apostles
              Successors;
              and to say that this state is
              ceased,
              is,
              in effect, to say, the Church it self
              is
              failed;
              for, as for Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s
              ordinary
              <hi>Officers,</hi>
              who derive not their Power from Christ and his
              Apostles:
              but from the Church, that is
              the Election
              of private Christians,
              who take them
              for their Pastors,
              they are none of Christ's Officers,
              nor have Legal Right to Church-authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things
              he urges
              to prove that the Church does
              not fail, though the Apostolical Office
              is
              ceased;
              First, <hi>That the Offices
              themselves were
              of the appointment
              of Christ:</hi> But what Offices
              are those? It is
              evident, that Christ, after his Resurrection,
              gave
              commission
            
            
            to none but his Apostles
              to preach the Gospel, this was
              the onely
              Office he instituted
              himself, and if this be failed,
              he has
              instituted
              no other. Yes, the Apostle sayes,
              that <hi>Christ gave
              some</hi>
            
            <hi>Apostles,
              and some Prophets,
              and some Evangelists,
              and some Pastors
              and Teachers.</hi>
              But how did
              Christ do this, but by such extraordinary
              Gifts
              as qualified
              them
              for such Ministeries
              in the Church, for the exercise of which, they
              received
              Rules
              and Power from the Apostles,
              who had
              the Supreme Government of the Church? these
              were
              certainly
              as much <hi>extraordinary Officers</hi>
              as the Apostles,
              and therefore may, with the same reason, be
              presumed
              to cease, when extraordinary Gifts
              ceased,
              as the Apostolical Office did,
              if we may take his word for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, not to dispute about the Appointment
              of Offices,
              let us consider who appoints
              these Officers,
              and for that he tells
              us, 2. <hi>That Persons
              were</hi>
            
            <hi>to be interested
              in these Offices,
              by the way and means
              by him
              prescribed:</hi>
              (so far we agree, for no man can have any authority
              conveyed
              to him,
              but in such wayes
              as Christ appoints)
              <hi>which were
              not such as depended
              on his own immediate,
            
            
            
            extraordinary actings,
              as it was
              with the former sort</hi> (this we also grant, if, by
              <hi>extraordinary actings</hi>
              he means
              an
              immediate Commission, or miraculous
              Gifts)
              <hi>but such as consisted
              in the Churches
              acting
              according
              to his Law, and in obedience to his
              Commands.</hi>
              This is
              so generally
              expressed,
              that we must learn his meaning
              what this Law is,
              from what he declares
              a little after: <hi>For none can communicate this Power</hi>
            
            <hi>to others, but those who have
              received
              it themselves from Christ. Now this
              is
              the whole Church, and not any Person in it, or Prelate over
              it: look whatever constitutes
              it a Church, that gives
              it all the Power and Priviledges
              of a Church; for a Church is
              nothing but a Society of profess'd
              Believers,
              enjoying
              all Church-Power and Priviledges,
              by vertue
              of the Law of Christ. Unto this Church, which
              is
              his Spouse, doth the Lord Christ
              commit the
              Keys
              of his House, by whom
              they are delivered
              into the hands
              of his Stewards,
              so far as their Office requires
              that trust.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            How much easier
              is
              it to make fine Hypotheses,
              than it is
              to prove them?
              Dr. <hi>O.</hi> knows
              it will not be easily
              granted
              without a Proof, that the whole
            
            
            Church, and not any Person or Prelate in it, (he should have
              added
              Apostle too) has
              received
              the Power of ordaining
              Officers
              from Christ; and yet here is
              no other proof assigned,
              but only a definition of a Church of his own
              making,
              that it is
              such a Society, as has
              this Power, which was
              the thing to be proved.
              St. <hi>Paul</hi> only tells
              us, that
            
            Christ gave
              Apostles
              and Prophets,
              and other Officers
              to the Church, to instruct and govern it, not that he
              gave
              the Church power to make such Officers.
              Has
              Christ given
              away the Keys
              to his Spouse, that is,
              his own Power and Authority? I am
              sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> represents
              the Church a little otherwise, not
            
            as a governing,
              but an
              obedient Wife. But our Saviour gave
              the Keys
              to <hi>Peter,</hi>
              and to the rest of the Apostles,
              and it does
              not appear, when he took
              them
              away again, and gave
              them
              to his Spouse: I am
              sure the Apostles
              kept
              them
              all the time they lived;
              and if there be any credit to be
              given
              to ancient
              Records,
              delivered
              them
              to their Successors;
              and thus they have been
              handed
              down to our days.
              And we never heard,
              till of late, that the Church laid
              any Claim to the Keys,
              any otherwise
            
            
            
            than as in the hands
              of their Officers;
              for indeed, the Keys
              is
              the Apostolical
              or Episcopal Office, and to give the
              Keys
              to the Church, is
              to make them
              all Bishops,
              and to leave none to be governed;
              and yet it was
              never heard
              yet, that any could give the Keys
              but those who had
              them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, suppose Christ has
              committed
              the Keys
              to his Church, it is
              worth enquiring,
              what this Church is,
              to whom
              the Keys
              are committed;
              if by this Church he means
              Pastor and People, we grant the Church
              has
              the Keys,
              but in their Pastors
              hands;
              if only a Company
              of Believers,
              about to form themselves
              into a Church-Society, I would fain know, where such a
              company of men
              are called
              a Church, or have Right to any Church-priviledges:
              for what he means
              by his <hi>essential Church,</hi> I
              cannot tell,
              since it is
              evident, there is
              no Church-Society without Church-Officers,
              nor any Church-power, where there
              is
              no Church. Let Church-Officers
              be ordinary or extraordinary, (I mean such
              Officers
              as are essential to the Constitution of a Church) it
              is
              evident, that
              in order of Nature, they are before the Church; for no man
              can be
            
            
            admitted
              into the Church, but by a legal Officer, and therefore,
              though of necessity those Bishopes
              and Pastors
              which are ordained
              after the Church is
              formed,
              must be in order of time, after the
              Being
              of the Church, yet the Office is
              before the Church, and necessary
              to the continuance of it; which
              is
              a plain Proof, that the Church, if by that we mean the body
              of Christian People, cannot give the
              Keys,
              though it may consent in the person to receive
              them,
              because Church-power is
              always
              antecedent to the Being
              of a Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Had
              Dr. <hi>O.</hi> sufficiently
              considered
              these things,
              he would not have scoffed
              so prophanely
              at the Conveyance of Church-power by successive
              Ordinations
              from the Apostles,
              without which, I confess I know not how we should have any
              Church-power, himself acknowledging,
              that it is
              to be had
              only in the way of Christ's Appointment, and he
              is
              able to shew
              no other way, that Christ has
              appointed,
              or the Church practised,
              but only this: for whatever Interest the People
              had
              in the choice of Church-officers,
              it was
              not the Peoples
              consent, but the Bishops
              Ordination, that made
              them
              so;
            
            
            
            and I would desire him,
              as he values
              the honour of Religion, not to endeavour
              to overthrow successive Ordinations
              by such sceptical Arguments,
              as will shake Christianity it self; and as he
              values
              the Honour of our common Lord and Saviour, not to burlesque
              his Institutions,
              which is
              the sum of all his Arguments
              against Succession; at least, if he will, grant that Christ
              might probably
              foresee, that there would be bad
              men
              at one time or other in the Succession.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sum is
              this, that the Consideration
              of the nature of the Church, which
              consists
              in an
              Union to Christ by a Covenant-relation, which
              unites
              all Christians
              into one Body, and is
              formed
              by Christ's Authority, undermines
              the very Foundations
              of Independant
              Congregations;
              for it is
              hence evident, that a Church-Society may be
              larger
              than a worshipping
              Congregation,
              since all Christians
              are united
              to Christ in one Body, and the Formation
              of a Church does
              not depend upon a
              voluntary Church-Covenant, for local and presential
              Communion, nor an
              inherent Authority in the People, to ordain their own
              Pastors,
              with
            
            
            whom
              they will live in personal Communion.
          </p>
          <p>But fourthly,
            Let us, out of civility, grant Dr. <hi>O.</hi> his own way of
            reasoning,
            and try what advantage he can make of it: He
            tells
            us, that all the ends
            of Church-Society can be <hi>observed
            only in Congregational Churches,</hi>
            because <hi>unto all of them
            there are required
            Assemblies
            of the whole Church:</hi> now <hi>these
            ends
            for which the Lord Christ appointed
            this Church-state, he reduces
            to three general Heads.</hi></p>
          <p>
            First, <hi>The professed
              subjection of the Souls
              and Consciences
              of Believers
              unto his Authority, in the observance of his
              Commands,
              which,</hi> he sayes,
              <hi>cannot be done
              in any Church-state imaginable, wherein the
              Members
              of the Church cannot
              meet together for this end, which they can
              onely
              do in such a Church as is
              congregational.</hi> And he gives
              these instances
              of this professed
              subjection to Christ: The first, our Baptismal Profession;
              for so he cites
              <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. which
              refers
              onely
              to the Institution of Baptism; now I would desire Dr.
              <hi>Owen</hi>
              to tell me, whether Baptism be not valid, unless it be
              administred
              in the presence of the whole
            
            
            
            Church, and what then he thinks
              of private Baptisms,
              which are now so generally
              practised,
              even among those of the Congregational way? or how he can
              prove that Baptism was
              alwayes
              administred
              in the presence of the whole Church? or, whether Baptism,
              administred
              in a Parochial Church, in as frequent
              an
              Assembly
              as a Congregational
              Church, may not be supposed
              as publick
              a profession of Faith, as that which
              is
              made
              in a Congregational
              Church? His second Instance is,
              that professed
              subjection to the Gospel, which the
              <hi>Corinthians</hi>
              made
              by their liberal Contributions
              for the supply of the necessities
              of other Churches;
              for so he alledges,
              2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. Now, I suppose, this might have
              been
              done,
              whatever Church-state they had
              been
              in: for, I hope Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
              will not undertake
              to prove, that a Diocesan Church cannot send liberal
              Contributions
              to the supply of Foreign Churches,
              and thereby profess their subjection
              to the Gospel; and yet, if this
              were
              well sifted,
              it would prove no great argument for Independent
              Churches:
              for this Contribution to the Saints
              of other Churches,
              was
              founded
              upon
            
            
            this Principle, that they were
              but one Body, and one Church, and that they are
              Members
              one of another, by a Divine
              Institution, which is
              not consistent
              with the notion of Independent Congregations.
              His third instance is,
              of that publick
              profession of Christ, which we are
              required
              to make before men,
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              or <hi>Heathens,</hi>
              who persecute
              the Religion and Disciples
              of Christ; for which he alledges
              <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 33. But surely
              this Profession of Christ may be
              made
              by men
              of any Church-state; for it is
              not to be made
              before the Church, but before Persecutors,
              as we may see <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.
              which, I suppose, is
              the other place intended
              by him,
              though the Printer has
              mistaken
              <hi>Matthew</hi>
              for <hi>Mark.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly,
              Another <hi>end</hi> (he assigns)
              <hi>of the Evangelical Church-state,
              is,
              the joynt
              celebration of all Gospel-Ordinances
              and worship.</hi> Now we will grant
              him,
              that Assemblies
              for publick
              Worship
              is
              a necessary Church-duty, but how
              does
              it appear, that it is
              essential to
              a Church-state, that all the Members
              of a Church should meet together
            
            
            
            in the same place for acts
              of Worship;
              that it has
              sometimes
              been
              so, when the Members
              of a Church have been
              no more than could meet together
              in one Congregation, we grant; but, that it
              alwayes
              was
              so, and that it is
              essential to the notion of a Church, we deny, and do not see
              how he has
              proved
              it: the Catholick
              Church is
              more properly
              a Church than any single
              Congregation, and yet cannot worship
              God all in one place; a consent in the same Worship
              does
              more effectually
              unite the Worshippers
              than the same place. <hi>The exercise of the
              Gifts
              and Graces
              of the Spirit of God, and the mutual edification of the
              Disciples,</hi>
              which are two reasons
              he assigns
              for this, equally
              extend to the whole Catholick
              Church; and, if this cannot be done
              in Assemblies,
              unless the whole Church assemble
              together, the
              Catholick
              Church can never
              exercise its
              Gifts
              and Graces,
              nor edifie
              its
              Members.
              And his two other Reasons,
              if I understand the force of them,
              quite overthrow his Notion: As,
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly,
              <hi>That he</hi> (Christ) <hi>might hereby
              testifie
              his promised
              presence with
            
            
            his Disciples
              unto the end of the World: for it
              is
              in Church-Assemblies,
              in the performance
              of his holy worship, that he is
              present with his Disciples:</hi>
              and proves
              this from <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 20. from Christ's promise to
              be with his Apostles
              in the discharge of their Apostolical Office, which
              is
              nothing to his purpose, for their Office
              was
              not confined
              to Christian
              Assemblies:
              and from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. where Christ
              is
              said
              to be in the midst of the golden
              Candlesticks,
              that is,
              the seven Churches
              of <hi>Asia,</hi> which he ought first to have
              proved
              Congregational
              Churches,
              and that he is
              never in the midst of them,
              but at the time of their Religious
              Assemblies,
              before it will prove what he intends;
              and yet his conclusion is
              as weak as his proofs,
              and indeed recoils
              upon himself: for Christ is
              certainly
              present with
              the Catholick
              Church, and all the Religious Assemblies
              in it, even with two or three gathered
              together, in
              his name, and therefore there is
              no need to confine a Church-state to a single Congregation,
              to engage the presence of Christ with
              them.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            Fourthly,
              He adds,
              <hi>In these Churches
              thus exercised
              in the holy Worship of God, he gives
              us a resemblance and representation
              of the great Assembly
              above, who worship God continually
              before his Throne.</hi> But, methinks,
              this is
              better done
              by the Worship of the whole Catholick
              Church, though divided
              into numerous
              worshipping
              Assemblies,
              than by one single Congregation, call it a Church, or what
              you please: I am
              sure Learned
              men
              conceive that Vision of the Throne of God,
              incircled
              by four and twenty Elders,
              in St. <hi>John's Revelation,</hi>
              to be a proper representation of the
              Catholick
              Church.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            But he proves,
              that <hi>Assemblies
              of the whole Church, at once and in one place for the
              Celebration of divine Worship is
              of the Essence of a Church, without which, it
              hath
              no real Being,
              because, that when God instituted
              such a Church-Form, as wherein all the
              Members
              of it could not ordinarily
              come together every Week, for this end; yet he
              ordained,
              that for the preservation of their Church-state, three
              times
              in a Year, the Males,
              (which was
              the circumcised
              Church) should appear together in one place, to celebrate
              the most
            
            
            solemn Ordinances
              of his Worship.</hi> This I confess,
              is
              very surprizing,
              and somewhat
              new: but I have several things
              to reply.
          </p>
          <p>First, this necessarily
            unchurches
            the Catholick
            Church, which I am
            not willing to do, till I see a fair Answer
            returned
            to what I have already said
            in proof of it; and if there be a
            Catholick
            Church, the same Difficulties
            which hindred
            present and personal Communion
            in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, <hi>from the
            Extent of the
            Limits
            of that Church to a whole Nation,</hi> are so far from
            being
            removed
            by the Gospel-state, that they are as much
            greater,
            as the whole World is
            larger
            than <hi>Jury.</hi></p>
          <p>
            Secondly,
              Methinks
              it is
              a little odd, for the Dr. to argue from
              an
              occasional, personal Communion, three
              times
              in a year, to prove the necessity of a
              constant,
              personal Communion, when one did
              not infer the other at that very time, when it
              was
              made
              necessary by a Divine Law, but did
              suppose there was
              no need of constant personal Communion,
              to the Being
              of a Church, by appointing
              such general Assemblies
              but three times
              a year; and I know Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
            
            
            
            does
              not like that Argument from occasional
              to constant Communion in other cases.
          </p>
          <p n="3">3. How does
            it appear, that these general Assemblies
            at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> three times
            a year, were
            instituted
            by God, <hi>for the Preservation of their Church-State,</hi>
            that they could not continue a Church without it? There
            is
            no such reason assigned
            for the Institution of these Feasts,
            but quite other Reasons
            assigned
            for them;
            and if they continued
            a Church all the year besides
            without this personal Communion, it
            is
            strange, that in the nature of the thing,
            Personal
            Communion should be so essential to the
            Being
            of a Church, that they could not continue a Church without it
            three times
            a year.</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. That these Feasts
              were
              not instituted
              for the preservation of their Church-state,
              is
              evident from this, that no Women
              were
              obliged
              to travel to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at these solemn
              Feasts;
              and therefore, if personal Communion be necessary to
              preserve a Church-state, they must of necessity forfeit
              their Church-state, if ever they
              had
              it; for, I find that is
              some doubt, from what
            
            
            the Dr. adds
              in a Parenthesis, concerning
              the Males,
              that they were
              <hi>the circumcised
              Church;</hi> they indeed only were
              circumcised:
              but did
              Women
              belong to the
              Church, or not? If they did,
              as I believe he will hardly
              deny, then the whole Church did
              never enjoy
              personal Communion, or Women
              must forfeit their Church-state, and I hope he will not be
              so unkind to that Sex, who are none of the worst
              Friends
              to Congregational Churches.

            5. I add farther, that even at these solemn
              Feasts,
              the whole body of <hi>Israel</hi> could not worship God
              <hi>at once, and in one place,</hi> as we may
              easily
              guess, if we consider their vast
              numbers,
              how many hundred
              thousand fighting
              men
              there were
              in the days
              of King <hi>David,</hi> and no Temple
              was
              capacious enough for the receiving
              of them
              at once, nor did
              the nature of these Feasts
              require it; for the Passover was
              eaten
              in private Houses,
              though offered
              at the Temple;
              and their first Fruits
              and Oblations
              might be offered
              to God without the presence of the whole
              Congregation,
              <hi>c.</hi> and they might worship at the Temple, or in
              their Synagogues,
              by
            
            
            
            Turns,
              and so may the largest
              Diocesan
              Church, and so they do, worship God, and hold Communion with
              one another, in distinct Assemblies,
              under the same Rule and Government.
          </p>
          <p>For, 6. The reason of their appearing
            at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> besides
            the mystical Signification
            of those Feasts,
            was
            peculiar to that Dispensation, that
            being
            the place which God had
            chose
            to place his name there; and therefore it
            is
            called
            <hi>appearing
            before the Lord;</hi> and when Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can
            shew
            us a place of such peculiar Sanctity and Holiness, where God
            dwells
            in so peculiar a manner, let our Church-state be what it will,
            I shall think all Christians
            bound
            to resort thither, as Occasion and Opportunity will
            permit.</p>
          <p>
            Thus I think the Dr. has
              failed
              in proving
              the necessity of <hi>the Assembly
              of the whole Church at once, and in one place, for the
              Celebration of the divine Worship,</hi> from the Example of
              the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and so
              has
              furnished
              us with the Example of a Church,
              divinely
              instituted
              to overthrow the necessity of local and personal Communion,
              to the Being
              of a Church; for, the <hi>Jewish</hi>
            
            
            Church had
              no such Communion, and yet was
              but one Church, instituted
              by God himself.

              the Exercise</hi>
            
            <hi>and Preservation of Discipline.</hi> Now Discipline
              is
              an
              act of Government, and I cannot conceive any imaginable
              Reason, why Government may not be
              extended
              to a much larger
              Society, than can meet together for
              Acts
              of Worship. It is
              evident to the very Sense and daily observation of all
              men,
              that one Prince, with his inferiour
              Ministers,
              may govern a whole Nation,
              and that very prudently
              and justly;
              and though Ecclesiastical Discipline
              be of a different kind from civil Government, as much as the
              Keys
              differ from the
              Sword, yet I could never learn, what
              was
              so peculiar to Church-Government from Civil Government, as
              should confine the exercise of it to a single Congregation.

            He 1. places
              Discipline in <hi>the preservation
              of the Gospel in it's Purity, and Obedience unto the
              Commands
              of Christ in it's Integrity.</hi> Now, why may not a Bishop
              with a hundred fixed
              Presbyters,
            
            
            
            take as good Inspection, and administer
              Discipline as prudently
              to a Church consisting
              of a hundred Parishes,
              as one Pastor can to a single Congregation?
              Why may not every Parish-Minister, who
              acts
              under the Care and Government of his Bishop, be as
              diligent in
              instructing
              his People, and taking
              an
              account of their Faith and Manners,
              as if he were
              an
              absolute Independent
              Pastor of that Church? Is
              it not more likely to preserve the
              Purity of the
              Faith, when every Presbyter
              must give an
              account of his Faith and Doctrine to his Bishop, than when
              he is
              an
              Independent Pastor, and accountable
              to no body but his Church, that
              is,
              his People, whom
              he is
              to instruct,
              who are more easily
              imposed
              on, than grave and learned
              Prelates.

              to preserve Love intire
              among his Disciples:</hi>
              But now I have already shewed,
              that Christian Love, which is
              commanded
              by Christ, consists
              in Christian
              Communion, and cannot subsist without
              it, which proves
              the necessity of Catholick
              Communion in the Universal
            
            
            Church, but is
              no good Argument
              to prove the confinement of Communion to
              an
              Independent Congregation,
              which makes
              a distinct Church by it self.

            As for what he objects,
              that, <hi>for the most part, those who pretend
              highly
              to the preservation of Love, by their
              coming
              to the same Church, who dwell in the same Parish, have not
              so much as the carkass,
              nay, not the shadow of it.</hi> I wish it be not too often
              true among the Congregational
              Brethren, as it is
              among those Christians,
              who worship at the same Parish Church; though we see
              indeed, that
              Faction is
              oftener
              apt to endear men
              than common Christianity:
              but the Question is
              not, what is,
              but what ought to be, and what may be, and which
              is
              the most effectual way to promote it?
              Does
              not this Command
              of loving
              one another extend to all Christians,
              and therefore as well to Neighbour-Christians,
              as to those of confederate Churches?
              Ought we not <hi>to express this Love by a due and constant
              discharge of mutual Exhortation,
              Admonition, Prayer, and watchful care one of another.</hi>

            Churches
              confine this Care to their own Members,
              they stint and extinguish
              this Spirit of Christian Charity, which
              is
              no longer
              Christian Charity than it extends
              to all Christians;
              if they do not, then this Christian Love may, at least, be
              as well discharged
              in larger
              Churches,
              as in Assemblies,

              Member out of their particular Independent
              Communion,
              but cannot cast him
              out of the Communion of the whole Church; for, as they are
              unaccountable in casting
              out their Members,
              so other Congregational
            
            
            
            Churches
              are as unaccountable
              in taking
              them
              in again, and thus it is
              only shifting
              Churches,
              leaving
              the Communion of one Church, and
              being
              admitted
              into another, which is
              nothing like the future Judgment,

              shuts
              men
              out of the Kingdom of Heaven, (which
              answers
              to the Christian Church on Earth) and
              leaves
              no back door to enter in at: but when there
              is
              but one Catholick
              Communion, and no possibility for
              him,
              who is
              deservedly
              cast out of the Church, to be received
              in again, till, by his Repentance and Reformation, he
              has
              given
              satisfaction to the Church which cast
              him
              out; this makes
              Excommunication
              truly
              formidable, and a kind of anticipation of the future
              Judgment;
              for he, who is
              cast out of the Church, is
              cast out of the visible state of Salvation, and, if the
              Church do not mistake in her Judgment,
              is
              eternally
              lost
              without reconciliation to God and his Church.

            I need not trouble my Readers
              with considering
              what follows,
              which can have no force, if his former
              Reasons
              are not good, and what seems
              most popular,
              will fall under consideration in a fitter place.
          </p>
          <p>
            His second Argument to prove particular
              Congregations
              to be the only Churches
              of Christ's Institution, is
              taken
              from <hi>the notation of the word, which</hi>
            
            <hi>determines
              the sense of it to a particural
              Congregation;</hi> for so 
              signifies,
              according
              to the use of the Septuagint,
              <hi>to congregate in a Church-Assembly;
              and  signifies
              nothing but a Congregation, which
              assembles
              for the Ends
              and Uses
              of it, and acts
              its
              Duties
              and Powers;
              and so it signifies
              in the New Testament.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, methinks,
              he playes
              at a low game, when he founds
              Congregational
              Churches
              on a Grammatical Criticism;
              and yet it is
              very ominous, that he stumbles
              at the Threshold; for he acknowledges
              that this word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi>
              which signifies
              a Congregation, and, as he sayes,
              can signifie
              nothing else, <hi>may be sometimes
              applied
              unto that, where Essence is
              not denoted
              thereby, as
            
            
            
            the Church Catholick
              invisible, which is
              only a mystical Society or Congregation:</hi> the
              meaning
              of which is,
              that though the Greek word, which we translate a Church,
              signifies
              a Congregation, and can signifie
              nothing else, yet, when it is
              applied
              to denote the Catholick
              Church, it does
              not signifie
              a Congregation,
              because the essence of the Catholick
              Church does
              not consist in a single Assembly
              or Congregation, as one would easily
              guess. But now, may not any man that will, argue the other
              way? that since this word signifies
              such a Church as is
              not a single Congregation, therefore we cannot
              argue from the
              notation of the word, that whatever Society, for the
              exercise of
              Religion, is
              called
              <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> must be a Congregational Church; for when
              any word is
              differently
              applied,
              we must learn in what sense it is
              used
              at any time, from some other marks
              than the bare notation of the word.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so it must be in this case,
              especially
              considering
              that the Catholick
              Church is
              most properly
              called
              <hi>Ecclesia,</hi>
              for this is
              that Church, which is
              the Body and the Spouse of Christ,
            
            
            and all particular Churches
              are called
              Churches
              only as they are Members
              of the Catholick
              Church, and therefore must be called
              Churches
              in the same Sense, that the Catholick
              Church is
              a Church, and therefore not considered,
              as particular Congregations.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he thinks
              to avoid this, by saying,
              that <hi>the Catholick
              Church is
              invisible,</hi> but let it be visible or invisible,
              is
              it truly
              and properly
              , (whether you translate that Church or
              Congregation)
              or not? if it be not, then there
              is
              no such thing in a proper Sense, as the
              Catholick
              Church, and so we have lost
              one Article of our Creed; if the
              Catholick
              Church be properly
              a Church, of which the particular
              Churches
              are Members,
              then particular Churches
              are of the same nature
              with the Catholick
              Church, and so not necessarily
              confined
              to a single Congregation; but he
              says,
              <hi>The Catholick
              Church is
              a mystical Society or Congregation,</hi>
              and are not particular Churches
              mystical Societies
              too? Are not they mystically
              united
              to Christ, as much as the Catholick
              Church? This then can make no difference. If there
            
            
            
            be any Church of divine Institution, which
              is
              not confined
              to a single Congregation,
              then a Church, as a Church is
              not Congregational.
          </p>
          <p>But he says,
            <hi>Wherever it is
            used
            to denote an
            outward visible Society, it doth connote their
            Assemblies
            together in one.</hi> Usually
            I will grant it does
            so, for Church-Assemblies
            are essential to a Church-State; but that
            is
            not the Question,
            whether a Church must have religious
            Assemblies?
            but whether a Church must be no
            larger
            than one Assembly?
            And this the Notation of the Word will not prove, for that may
            be called
            a Church or Congregation for religious Worship, which
            is
            united
            under one Rule and Discipline, though all the
            Members
            of it do not worship God <hi>at once, in one place:</hi> for
            thus the Catholick
            Church is
            a worshipping
            Congregation, tho it meets
            by parts;
            for that the Catholick
            Church is
            a mere invisible, notional Society, I think I have
            sufficiently
            confuted
            already, and
            shall consider more hereafter.</p>
          <p>
            And yet if I had
              a mind to play the Critick
              too, I very much question,
            
            
            whether the Church in the New Testament
              be called
               with reference
              to Church-Assemblies
              for Worship,
              for  signifies
              to call out, and so refers
              to their being
              called
              out of the World, into a separate State and
              Covenant-relation to God, upon which Account,
              Christians
              are called
              the , the called
              of God, and , the
              called
              Saints,
              as God stiles
              his <hi>Israel,</hi> his <hi>called,</hi>
              that is,
              his chosen
              people, and
              is
              often equivalent to  the Elect people of
              God, whom
              he hath
              chosen
              to himself; and so <hi>Ecclesia</hi>
              signifies
              no more, but such a Society of men,
              who are called
              out of the World into a Covenant-relation to God, in and
              through our Lord Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he says,
              our Saviour has
              instituted
              such <hi>an
              Evangelical Church-State,</hi>
            
            <hi>(i. e.</hi> A Congregational Church) in <hi>Math. 18.
              17. If he shall neglect to hear
              them,
              tell the Church.</hi> He disputes
              at large about the meaning
              of these words,
              and will not allow it sufficient to
              weaken their
              Authority, that they are expounded
              by all sorts
              of men,
              to favour their own Church-State, whether
              Papal, Diocesan,
              Presbyterian, Independent;
            
            
            
            and I grant, this is
              no good Argument against any Text of
              Scripture,
              if there be any certain Marks,
              whereby to determine them
              to any particular Sense; but if the
              words
              be doubtful and ambiguous, and capable of different
              Senses,
              their Authority alone is
              not a sufficient Foundation to relye
              on, in any case: and I cannot find, that Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              has
              alledged
              any thing to confine the Sense to a
              Congregational
              Church. I shall briefly
              examine what he
              has
              said,
              and leave others to judge.

            the Catholick
              Church: this we will not dispute with

            2. <hi>We have proved,

              of a single Congregation;</hi> this indeed he
              has
              attempted
              to prove, but has
              not done
              it. I grant this may signifie
              so much, that such Censures
              should be passed
              on Offenders
              by the Apostles
              or Bishops,
              and their Presbyteries
              in a publick
              Assembly
              of Christians;
              and therefore it is
              said

              but I do
            
            
            not see that this proves
              the whole Church to be but one such single
              Assembly
              or Congregation.

            3. <hi>The Persons
              intended,

              Now, if Dr. <hi>O.</hi> will allow, that <hi>tell the

              a standing

              Offences
              and Scandals,
              which may happen among Christians,
              and will stand to what he has
              now said,
              that the Parties
              <hi>offending
              and offended,
              must belong to the same Society;</hi> it
              is
              a most infallible Demonstration,
              that our Saviour by the <hi>Church</hi> cannot mean a single
              Congregation,
              for there may as many Offences
              and Scandals
              happen between Christians
              of distinct Congregations,
              as between
              those who belong to the same Congregational Church; nay, it
              is
              most likely to be so, if what he elsewhere
              affirms,
              be true, that a Congregational Church
              is
              the only effectual means
              to preserve a fervent Love and Charity among
              Christians;
              for then it is
              more likely, that the Members
              of several Congregations
              should quarrel, than the Members
              of the same: but now according
            
            
            
            to Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Acceptation of the Church, for a single
              Congregation, our Saviour has
              made
              no Provision to remove
              the Scandals
              which shall arise between
              two Persons,
              who are Members
              of distinct Congregational Churches,
              for they cannot judge the Members
              of another Congregation, as according
              to the Independent Principles
              they certainly
              cannot: and yet methinks
              it is
              as necessary to remove the Scandals
              which happen between persons
              of different
              Congregations,
              as between those of the same, and
              was
              certainly
              intended
              by Christ in that Rule, <hi>tell it to the Church;</hi> if
              he intended
              by this, to preserve
              Peace and Unity among Christians;
              which plainly
              shews,
              that by the Church here he means
              a larger
              Society than a
              single Congregation, which is
              not sufficient to remove Scandals
              and Offences
              among neighbour Christians,
              who may dwell very near together, and yet be of distinct
              Churches.

            a Church that may be spoke
            with when it is
            met
            together, and so may any other Church as well as a
            Congregational
            Church.</p>

            5. <hi>It is
              said,
              , tell the Church, not a Church, but the
              Church, namely, whereunto thou and thy Brother do
              belong:</hi> But I suppose he has
              enough of this Argument already.
          </p>
          <p n="6">6. <hi>One end of this direction
            is,
            that the offending
            and offended
            Parties
            may continue together in the communion of the same Church in
            love, without dissimulation:</hi>
            and therefore this Church must be
            larger
            than the bounds
            of a particular
            Congregation; unless he can secure us, that no
            Christians
            shall ever quarrel but those of the same
            Congregation.</p>
          <p n="7">7. <hi>The meaning
            is
            not, tell the Diocesan
            Bishop,---for he himself is
            not a Church:</hi> but he is
            the chief Governour
            of the Church, and therefore the
            Address may be
            first made
            to him.
            Nor is
            it,</p>
          <p n="8">
            8. <hi>The Chancellor's Court that our
              Saviour
              intended,
              be it what it will, it is
              a scandal to all Churches
              to have that name applied
              to it.</hi> Nor did
              any one ever say, that the Chancellor's Court
              was
              the Church, but an
              assistant Court to the Bishop, and no more scandalous in
              its
              Institution, than a Bench of Lay-Elders
            
            
            
            to decide Church-Controversies;
              which yet, I think, is
              somewhat better than an
              Ecclesiastical Democracy: at least, it
              is
              more like the Government of the Jewish
              Synagogues,
              which determined
              lesser Causes
              in subordination
              to their <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> not by the
              Votes
              of the People, but by the Sentence
              of the Court, to which possibly
              our Saviour might have some respect, if we will allow
              him
              to speak the Language
              of those times,
              so as to be understood
              by those who heard
              him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor, lastly,
              <hi>is
              it a Presbytery, or the Association of the
              Elders
              of many particular
              Congregations,
              that is
              intended;
              for the power claimed
              in such associated
              Presbyteries,
              is,
              with respect to what is
              already in or before particular
              Congregations,
              which they have not wisdom or Authority,
              as is
              supposed,
              finally
              to order and determine. But this
              supposeth,
              that the Address in the first place be
              made
              unto a particular Congregation, which
              is
              therefore
              firstly,
              and properly
              here intended.</hi>
              If by Presbyteries
              he means
              primitive Presbyteries
              of the Apostles
              and Elders,
              or the Bishop and Presbyters,
              who determined
              matters
              of difference
            
            
            in the presence of the People, it
              is
              most likely this was
              meant
              by our Saviour in that Command, <hi>Tell it to the
              Church.</hi> For the Apostolical Practise
              is
              the best Exposition of our Saviour's
              words,
              and that this cannot be confined
              to particular Congregations,
              I have already
              proved
              from his own Arguments;
              and yet why there may not be a more general Tribunal, which
              has
              a more extensive Jurisdiction, without which many
              Controversies
              among Christians
              cannot be determined,
              I see not how he proves:
              for if we must preserve
              Catholick
              Communion among Christians
              of distinct, particular Communions,
              a larger
              Power and Jurisdiction
              is
              necessary to this end, than the inherent Authority of a
              particular Church, not onely
              Congregational but Diocesan.
          </p>
          <p>This is
            all I need take notice of with reference to this Argument;
            Several other things
            he sayes,
            which seem to me very weak and unconcluding, and unworthy of
            Dr. <hi>O.</hi> had
            he a good Cause to manage, but I pass
            them
            over, as not necessary to our present
            Controversie.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            His third Argument to prove Congregational
              Churches
              instituted
              by
            
            Christ, is,
              <hi>from the nature of the Churches
              instituted
              by the Apostles,
              and their ends,
              as it is
              expressed
              in the Scripture:</hi> this he sayes
              but very little of, and therefore
              I shall joyn
              it with his second general
              Argument for Congregational Churches,
              from <hi>the state of the first</hi>
            
            <hi>Churches
              after the Apostles
              to the end of the second Century.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>And all the difficulty I can see in
            answering
            that Historical Account which he
            hath
            given
            us of the primitive Churches,
            is,
            in stating
            the Question right, which he has
            with great Art laboured
            to perplex and confound.</p>
          <p>
            The thing to be proved
              is,
              that Congregational
              Churches
              are the onely
              Churches
              of Divine Institution. To prove this, he must
              shew,
              that, <hi>de facto,</hi> such Churches
              alone were
              instituted
              by the Apostles,
              and owned
              in the purest
              Ages
              of the Church: And to do this plainly,
              he ought distinctly
              to consider the several parts
              of a Congregational
              Constitution, as it is
              opposed
              to the Diocesan Constitution of the Church of
              <hi>England;</hi> for otherwise he
            
            
            can neither serve his own Cause, nor injure
              ours,
              and so there are three things
              to be distinctly
              considered:
              1. The Offices
              and Officers
              of the Church. 2. The bounds
              and extent of the Church, whether it
              were
              confined
              to one or more Congregations,
              or worshipping
              Assemblies.
              3. The Power of the People in the Government of the Church.
              He has
              given
              some hints
              and insinuations
              of all these, as he goes
              along, but has
              never duely
              stated
              either. And
              therefore I shall reduce his Historical Account of this
              matter to these three Heads,
              consider how he states
              these Questions,
              and how pertinent
              his Testimonies
              are to prove what he intends,
              which, I think, every one will acknowledge to be a fair way
              of proceeding.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. As for the first, the Offices
              and Officers
              of the Church; the great Question
              is,
              Whether Christ and his Apostles
              instituted
              a parity or imparity of Officers
              in the Church? whether Bishops
              and Presbyters
              be equal? or whether
              Bishops
              have a Superiour
              Power, Office, Order, or Degree, call it what you please,
              over Presbyters.
              Now this Question he dares
              not meddle with,
            
            
            
            during the Apostles
              times,
              for, it is
              evident, the
              Apostles,
              while they lived,
              had
              a Superiority of Power over other
              Church-Officers,
              and governed
              the Churches
              which they had
              planted,
              either in
              Person, when they were
              present with them,
              or by Letters,
              or by sending
              their Apostles
              and Evangelists
              among them,
              to give directions,
              and to set things
              in order which were
              amiss. So that
              we can have no Example
              of a parity of Church-Officers
              all the Scripture-times,
              during the Apostolical
              Age: for, though the Elders,
              Presbyters,
              Bishops,
              (for they are indifferently
              called
              by these names
              in Scripture) who were
              ordained
              by the Apostles
              for the Government of the Churches
              planted
              by them,
              did,
              under the Apostles,
              govern with equal Power,
              yet the Apostles
              themselves were
              their Bishops,
              and had
              a Superiour
              Power over them,
              and did
              censure, depose, and excommunicate
              them,
              when occasion required
              it. Thus St. <hi>John</hi>
            
            threatens
              to reward <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> for
              rejecting
              those Brethren whom
              he sent,
              and neither entertaining
              them
              himself, nor suffering
              others to do it. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              excommunicated
              <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and
            
            
            
            <hi>Philetus,</hi> and interposed
              by his own Authority for the Excommunication of
            
            the incestuous Person in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
              threatens
              the Factious, Schismatical Persons
              in that Church with Excommunication, unless they
              reformed
              their manners,
              and therefore
              it was
              wisely
              and cautiously
              done
              of the Dr. not to urge the Apostolical
              Churches,
              as a pattern of Congregational
              parity.
          </p>
          <p>He manages
            himself with the same Prudence and caution, as to this
            matter, in the
            following
            History of the Primitive Church; he
            discovers
            something in
            the beginning
            about the Superiority
            of one Church over another,
            and by what means
            Metropolitical
            Churches
            were
            introduced,
            which is
            nothing to this present Business, and
            has
            in part been
            accounted
            for already, and may be more hereafter; but as for the parity
            of Officers
            in the same Church, though he glances
            at it, as often as he can find any occasion, yet his great
            business is
            to fence, and ward off the blow, at which I must acknowledge
            him
            to be a great Artist.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            Thus he acknowledges,
              that in <hi>Churches
              which had
              many Elders,
              or Presbyters</hi>
            
            <hi>in them,
              as apparently
              most of them
              had,
              they might, and some of them
              did,
              choose out some one endued
              with especial Gifts,
              that might in some sort preside amongst
              them,
              and who had
              quickly
              the name of Bishop appropriated
              unto him;---But this changed
              not the state of the Church, though it
              had
              no Divine Warrant to authorize
              it.</hi> But the Question is
              not about the Presidency in a Colledge
              of Presbyters,
              of equal Authority,
              which Antiquity is
              a great stranger
              to, nor about a distinction of names,
              which was
              not presently
              done,
              even when the Offices
              were
              distinct, but that Superiour
              Power and Authority
              which Bishops
              challenged
              over their Presbyters,
              such as the Apostles
              had
              in their time, and such as <hi>Ignatius</hi>
              gives
              the Bishop in his time; and though this be no foundation
              possibly
              for Metropolitical Churches,
              yet it is
              for Diocesan, which is
              nothing else but a Church under the
              Government
              of his Bishop, and subject Presbyters;
              and such an
              inequality as this I think would alter the Church-state,
            
            
            had
              it first been
              instituted
              in a parity of
              Officers;
              which is
              like changing
              a Commonwealth, governed
              by a Senate with its
              President, into a Monarchy.

          <p>
            At other times,
              he endeavours
              to perswade
              us, that this Dispute about the distinction of
              Bishops
              and Presbyters
              does
              not concern the present Controversie
              of Congregational Churches:
              Thus, when he alledged
              several Testimonies
              out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles,
              he adds,
              <hi>We are no way at present concerned
              in the Controversie
              about that distinction
              of Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              which the Writer of those Epistles
              does
              assert.---Although therefore there might</hi>
            
            <hi>have been,
              and probably
              was,
              some alterations
              in the Order of the Churches,
              from what was
              of primitive Institution, yet was
              there as yet no such change in their state, as to make way
              for those greater
              alterations
              which not long after ensued.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Those greater
              Alterations
              he means,
              is
              the multiplication and increase of a Church into more
              Congregations
              than one under the care of the same
              Bishop, with
              his Presbyters,
              who were
              increased
              also, as the increase of the Church
              required.
              Now, let any man
            
            
            
            judge which of these two is
              the greatest
              Alteration, the increase of the Church, by the increase of
              Believers,
              into more
              Congregations,
              or the alteration
              of the whole Government of the Church, from a parity to
              an
              imparity of Officers?
              How is
              it possible that such an
              Innovation as this should be introduced
              in the whole Christian Church, in
              an
              Age of Apostolical men,
              who conversed
              with the Apostles
              themselves, (as <hi>Ignatius</hi>
              did)
              in a time of Persecutions
              and Sufferings,
              when the Episcopal
              Honour and Office had
              no temporal
              Advantages
              to recommend it, but advanced
              men
              only to make them
              a fairer
              mark, and more exposed
              to popular
              Fury, without the least notice taken
              of it in any ancient Records.
              We may, with greater
              reason say, this is
              very improbable, than Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              has
              to say it is
              probable; for it is
              easie
              to form fine Schemes
              of things
              in a fruitful Fancy,
              and imagine how that may be done,
              which first should be proved
              was
              done;
              but this is
              not to write a History, but a Romance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is
              stranger still to say, that this
              does
              not concern the Controversie
              of Congregational Churches;
              for, have
            
            
            they any thing like a Primitive Bishop and
              Presbyters?
              if they have not, then their Churches
              are not agreeable to the primitive Form, and so have not so
              good a Plea for a Divine Institution, as Diocesan
              Churches
              have, which are still governed
              by Bishops
              and subject Presbyters.
              Yet, sayes
              Dr. <hi>O. We do maintain,</hi>
            
            <hi>that there ought to be in every
              particular
              Congregation, unto the compleatness
              of it, many Elders,
              or Overseers;
              that the number of them
              ought to be increased,
              as the increase of the Church makes
              it necessary
              for their edification:</hi> But, if he would have
              dealt
              fairly,
              he ought to have told
              us what these <hi>Elders</hi>
              are, whether Lay or Clergy, whether they are such as must
              receive <hi>double Honour,</hi> that
              is,
              be maintained
            
            at the charge of the Church, or some good wealthy
              Shop-keepers,
              who can maintain their Bishop; whether they are such as in
              the absence of the Bishop can teach and instruct,
              administer
              Sacraments
              and Church-Censures;
              where shall we find Independent
              Elders
              in all primitive Antiquity? Is
              not this, as the Dr. complains,
              to <hi>wrest Ecclesiastical
              words
              to other significations
              than at</hi>
            
            <hi>first they were
              applied
              unto, to impose the present state of
              things
              among them,
              on
            
            
            
            those who went
              before, who knew
              nothing of them.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Nay, this Controversie
            about the Form of Government in the primitive Church,
            seems
            to me the most effectual way to determine the Question about
            Congregational
            Churches:
            for Christ having
            not determined
            the Bounds
            of Churches
            (as it does
            not yet appear he has
            from any thing Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has
            urged)
            if he have withall
            instituted
            such a Form of Government,
            as is
            fitted
            to take care of a much larger
            Church than a single Congregation,
            it is
            a very probable Argument,
            that he did
            not intend to confine a Church-state to a particular
            Congregation.</p>
          <p>
            Had
              the Apostles
              ordained
              onely
              a Presbyter or two in every particular Church they
              pleased,
              and when the number of Converts
              increased,
              ordained
              more Presbyters,
              with their distinct Cures,
              as it is
              now in our Parish Churches,
              it had
              been
              a good Argument they intended
              no larger
              a Church than a single
              Congregation, which one or two Presbyters
              might take care of: but when we find great
              numbers
              of such Elders
              or Presbyters
              ordained
              in the Apostolical
              Churches,
              who took
              care of the
            
            
            Church in common, under the Inspection and Government of the
              Apostles,
              this argues,
              that their Work either at present
              was,
              or in time was
              designed
              it should be, much greater
              than the care of a single Congregation: And I wonder what
              Dr. <hi>O.</hi> means,
              when he argues
              the other way, to prove those Churches
              planted
              by the Apostles,
              to be congregational; because, <hi>The
              Apostles
              appointed
              in them
              ordinary Elders</hi>
            
            <hi>and Deacons,
              that might administer all Ordinances
              to the whole Church; and take Care of all the Poor---Now the
              Care, Inspection,
              and Labour of ordinary Officers
              can extend it self no farther than to a particular
              Congregation.</hi> He should have
              said
              to a particular Church; for ordinary
              Officers,
              if there be enough of them,
              may administer
              all Ordinances
              to a great many particular
              Societies
              united
              in the Communion of one Church. And what he
              adds,
              <hi>No man can administer all Ordinances
              to a Dioeesan
              Church,</hi> is
              very true; but a great many may, and that I
              always
              took
              to be the Reason of multiplying
              Elders
              in the Church, to do that by many which one could not do;
              and I would fain see Dr. <hi>O.</hi> demonstrate, that a
              Church which has
              many ordinary Officers
              must be no larger
              than any one of them
              can administer all
            
            
            
            Ordinances
              to; and indeed, when we consider, that as
              Christians
              multiplied
              within the Precincts
              of any Bishop's Diocess,
              they were
              not formed
              into distinct Churches,
              under the Care of other Bishops;
              but the Presbyters
              were
              increased
              to take Care of them,
              and by degrees,
              the Bishoprick
              divided
              into distinct Titles
              or Parishes,
              with some fixed
              Presbyters
              over them,
              or at least, that some such distinct
              Titles
              there were,
              even as ancient as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; and all this
              done
              without the least suspition
              of any Innovation
              in the Church-state, or the least
              notice
              taken
              of any Change; the Fathers
              of the third and fourth Centuries
              firmly
              believing,
              that they retained
              the same Episcopacy,
              which was
              in the Church from the Beginning.
              I say, the consideration of these
              things
              would incline any indifferent
              man to believe, that though it is
              possible,
              that in some places,
              in the beginning
              of Christianity, or in the times
              of Persecution, a Bishop might have no more
              Christians
              under his Care, than might meet in a single Congregation;
              yet this was
              never thought essential to a Church-state, the Episcopal
              form of Government being
              sitted
              to take care of many Congregations;
              at least, it is
              not sufficient to
            
            
            prove Congregational Churches,
              to shew
              that some Episcopal Churches
              were
              no bigger
              than single Congregations;
              unless he can prove, that this was
              standing
              received
              Rule among them,
              that none should be bigger.
          </p>
          <p>Let us now consider what he hints
            out of Antiquity, to overthrow this
            Distinction
            between Bishop and Presbyters;
            and he first appeals
            to <hi>Clemens</hi> his Epistle from the Church of
            <hi>Rome</hi> to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
            which we acknowledge to be a venerable
            piece of Antiquity, but should much wonder, if there should be
            found any Passages
            in that Epistle, against Episcopacy,
            when, if we will believe the best
            Records
            we have of Church History, he himself
            was
            at that time Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but let us consider what
            he says.</p>
          <p>
            <hi>If there were
              at this time a Bishop in the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>he
              was
              either deposed</hi>
            
            <hi>by the People, or he was
              not; if he were
              deposed,
              he was
              only one of the Presbyters,
              for they were
              only Presbyters
              that were
              deposed;
              if he were
              not, why is
              he not once called
              on to discharge his Duty in curing
              of that Schism, or blamed
              for his Neglect.</hi> How many pretty
              Hypotheses
              now might a man of ordinary
              Fancy invent, to answer this Objection?
              Suppose we should say, that he
            
            
            
            was
              neither deposed,
              nor yet able to cure this Schism by his Authority, and
              therefore,
              neither deserved
              Blame, nor wanted
              Exhortations
              to do his Duty. Suppose there were
              some Independent Brethren, who are for
              gathering
              Churches
              out of Churches,
              and for exercising
              their Sovereign
              Power over their Pastors,
              when they do not please them,
              who had
              set themselves up against their Bishop and
              Presbyters;
              to what purpose had
              it been
              to have minded
              the Bishop in this case of his duty, to cure the Schism? I
              believe the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>
              is
              as mindful of his Duty, and as heartily
              desirous to cure our Schisms,
              as the Bishop of <hi>Corinth</hi> could be; and
              Thanks
              be to God, is
              not yet deposed:
              but it would be a ludicrous thing, and a plain Affront, for
              any other Church or Bishop to blame
              him
              for not using
              his Authority, to reduce Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              and their Brethren to the Unity of the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, suppose their Bishop was
              deposed,
              then says
              the Dr. <hi>He was
              but a Presbyter, for none but Presbyters
              were
              deposed;</hi>
              that is,
              all those who were
              deposed,
              are called
              by the common name of Presbyters,
              and therefore, having
              the same Name, there could be no distinction of their
              Office,
            
            
            which is
              the same Argument with what he afterwards
              uses,
              that <hi>Clemens mentions
              only two
              Ranks
              of Officers,
              Bishops
              and Deacons---other
              distinction and difference of ordinary
              Officers,
              besides
              that of Bishops
              or</hi>
            
            <hi>Elders,
              and Deacons,
              the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in these
              days
              knew
              not.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>But I wonder learned
            men
            will insist upon such Arguments
            as these, from the promiscuous use of
            Names,
            especially
            in the Writings
            of Apostolical men;
            for this very Argument would prove, that there
            was
            no difference between the Apostles
            and other Ministers
            of the Church in the Apostles
            days;
            for the Apostles
            themselves were
            called
            Bishops,
            Presbyters,
            Elders,
            Deacons,
            and many besides
            the Twelve, were
            called
            Apostles;
            and so it was
            in after-ages,
            though the Offices
            were
            distinct, the Names
            were
            common: and there is
            sufficient
            Evidence, that so it was
            at this time, from this very Epistle.</p>
          <p>
            For one Argument he insists
              on to convince
              them
              of the Evil of their Schism, is
              <hi>from that Order our Lord in great Wisdom
              has
              appointed
              in the Celebration of holy Offices,</hi>
            
            <hi>that he has
              appointed
              what should be done
              and who should do it, that all things
              being
              religiously
              observed
              which he has
              appointed,
              may be performed
              in such a manner as is
              acceptable
            
            
            
            to him;
              and therefore, those who make their
              Oblations
              in their appointed
              Seasons
              and Order, are acceptable and blessed,
              for those do not offend, who obey the
              Laws,
              and Rules,
              and Institutions
              of our Master.</hi> And then immediately
              adds,
              <hi>For there are proper Offices
              allotted
              to the High Priest, a proper place
              assigned
              to the Priests,
              and proper Ministeries
              incumbent on the Levites;
              and the Lay-man has
              his Lay-duties
              also, let every one of us Brethren in our proper Rank and
              Order, praise God</hi> (or celebrate the Eucharistical Feast
              to which it is
              most probable he refers
              in ) <hi>with a good Conscience, not
              transgressing
              the setled
              bounds
              of our Ministry, as it becomes
              comely Order.</hi> Here he makes
              three distinct Orders
              in the Christian Church of which he
              speaks,
              answerable to the High Priest, the
              Priests
              and Levites
              in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, which
              was
              a familiar way among the Ancients,
              of characterizing
              and distinguishing
              the Orders
              of Bishops,
              Presbyters,
              and Deacons.
              And this is
              a plain Argument, that when two
              pages
              after, he mentions
              only Bishops
              and Deacons;
              he either uses
              Bishop as a common name for Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              or by Deacons
              understands
              Presbyters,
              as that name is
              sometimes
              applied
              by the Ancients;
              and I am
              not without
            
            
            fair probabilities
              of either of these.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the first, that the name Bishop may be
              used
              as a common name for Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              when they are spoken
              of both together (for it is
              questioned
              by Learned
              men,
              whether mere Presbyters
            
            were
              ever called
              Bishops,
              when they were
              spoken
              of by themselves, though Bishops
              are often called
              Presbyters)
              is
              probable, because this name was
              promiscuously
              used
              in the Apostle's times,
              when <hi>Clemens</hi> lived,
              and conversed
              with them,
              which makes
              it likely enough that he might still retain the Apostolical
              Use of the words.
              But, besides
              this, we may easily
              observe in Ancient Writers,
              who acknowledged
              the Episcopal Preheminence,
              that they used
              to denote the Governours
              of the Church by some common name; for though the Authority
              of Bishops
              and Presbyters
              is
              very different, yet they both have Authority in the Church,
              and therefore when they were
              not concerned
              to distinguish the different degrees
              of Power, they included
              them
            
            both in one common name, as joynt
              Governours
              of the Church. Thus, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              observes,
              <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> giving
              an
              Account of the
              state of Christian Churches
              in his time, <hi>mentions
              only two sorts
              of Officers,</hi>
            
            
            
             and ,
              <hi>Presidents
              and Deacons,</hi>
              and yet there is
              one, whom
              he peculiarly
              calls
               in the Church, to
              whom
              the care and Government, and the Administration of Religious
              Offices
              peculiarly
              belongs,
              by whom,
              no doubt, he means
              the Bishop of the Church: for what the Dr.
              adds,
              <hi>That of the first sort, in the Duty of one of their
              Assemblies,
              he mentions
              but one,</hi> , <hi>the President, the
              Ruler, the Bishop, to whom
              belonged
              the administration
              of all the holy Mysteries;</hi>
              intimating,
              that in a particular Church there
              was
              but one President, or Bishop, or
              Ruler, with his
              Deacons,
              is
              so contrary to the practise of all Antiquity, that it
              does
              not become a modest man to obtrude such a Fallacy upon his
              Readers;
              for whether he will allow Bishops
              to be Superior
              to Presbyters
              or not, yet he can shew
              no one instance in primitive Antiquity
              of any Church that had
              but one Presbyter, or President, and
              Deacons
              in it. And when he acknowledged
              just before,
              that besides
              their general meeting
              on the Lord's Day, they had
              frequent lesser
              Occasional Assemblies
              of the Brethren, where they met
              by parts:
              It is
              strange that he will allow them
              but one President,
              be he Bishop or Presbyter, for all
            
            
            those Occasional Assemblies.
              Much at the same rate he argues,
              that he is
              not <hi>called
              a President with respect to any
              preheminency
              over other Ministers
              and Elders,
              like a Diocesan
              Bishop, because he terms
              him
              only</hi> , <hi>He that
              presided
              over the Brethren of that Church;</hi> as if, when a
              Bishop
              is
              so often stiled
              <hi>Episcopus,</hi> or <hi>Pastor gregis,</hi> or
              <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> the Bishop or Pastor of the Church, or
              Flock, even by those Writers,
              who own the Bishops
              Superiority over Presbyters,
              because he is
              called
              only the Bishop
              of the People or Church, therefore he
              is
              not superiour
              to Presbyters.
              Presbyters
              are not properly
              the Bishop's Flock, but subordinate
              Governours
              with him
              of the Church; and therefore his Office
              is
              most properly
              described
              by his Relation to Christian
              People, as their Pastor or Shepherd.
          </p>
          <p>
            To give but one Instance more, <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
              I think, will be acknowledged
              by all to own the Superiority of
              Bishops
              over Presbyters,
              who appeals
              to the Succession of Bishops
              from the Apostles
              themselves,
            
            whose Chairs
              they possess'd, and yet, in that passage which Dr.
              <hi>O.</hi> cites,
              as favouring
              this equality, when he gives
              a general account of the Government of the Church, he
              includes
              both Bishop and Presbyters
              in one common name, and calls
            
            
            
            them
              all <hi>Seniores,</hi> which is
              the <hi>Latine</hi>
              word for , Elders
              or Seniors:
              <hi>praesident
              probati quique Seniores,</hi> the
              approved
              Elders
              preside or rule in Church-Assemblies.
              Now, it is
              sufficiently
              known,
              that in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time the Bishop
              was
              the chief <hi>Senior</hi> or Elder, who
              governed
              both the subject Elders,
              and the Body of Christians,
              and therefore we cannot think that he would leave out the
              Bishop, in giving
              an
              account of Church-Officers,
              without whom
              nothing was
              done
              in the Church; and if he does
              mention him,
              he must be included
              in the common name of
            
            <hi>Seniors</hi>
              or Elders.
              And this St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> does
              expresly,
              who directs,
              that <hi>the young men
              should not frequent the Houses
              of Widows
              or Virgins,
              unless it be to visit them,
              and let them
              do this in the company of the Seniors,
              that is,
              of the Bishop, or, if need be, of the
              Presbyters.</hi>
              So that the Dr's Argument,
              from such general and common names
              which were
              used
              to include both the Bishop and his
              Presbyters,
              as being
              both, though not equally,
              concerned
              in the Government of the Church,
              is
              of no force to disprove their distinction in
              Order and Power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, that other Opinion, that when St. <hi>Clemens</hi>
              names
              onely
              Bishops
              and Deacons,
            
            
            by Deacons
              he means
              Presbyters,
              is
              not without some fair probability; for Deacon
              was
              not appropriated
              to that inferiour
              Office, which is
              now commonly
              signified
              by it, but was
              attributed
              to the Apostles
              themselves. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and
              <hi>Apollos</hi>
              are said
              to be the Deacons,
              , by whom
              the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
              believed;
              but the best Argument for this is,
              that St. <hi>Clemens</hi> applies
              an
              ancient Prophesie
              to this purpose, which uses
              to be applied
              by some ancient Writers
              to Bishops
              and Presbyters.
              . I will give thy
              Bishops
              in righteousness, and thy Deacons
              in Faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now what he renders
              , Bishops,
              the <hi>Septuagint</hi> translate by ,
              Princes,
              and what he renders
              , Deacons,
              they read ,
              Bishops:
              And St. <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the place, by these
              Princes
              understands
              Bishops,
              admiring
              the Majesty of God in appointing
              such Ministers,
              whom
              himself calls
              Princes;
              and so it seems
              <hi>Clement</hi> did
              too, by his altering
              the Text, and reading
              Bishops
              instead of Princes:
              and thus the Bishop is
              more than once called
              <hi>Princeps Sacerdotum,</hi>
              the Prince, or Chief of the Priests
              or Elders,
              in ancient Writers;
              and then
            
            
            
            by Bishops,
              which he reads
              Deacons,
              he can understand nothing less than
              Presbyters,
              for, though Presbyters
              may be sometimes
              called
              Bishops,
              it is
              certain Deacons
              never are: and when he gives
              an
              account of Church-Officers,
              no wonder he
              mentions
              onely
              Bishops
              and Presbyters,
              as the onely
              Persons
              who had
              any Rule and Authority in the Church. I do not urge this
              from any force I conceive
              to be in the application of this Prophecy, but only as a
              probable way of understanding
              what he means
              by his Bishops
              and Deacons.
              These are the most material hints
              he has
              given
              to overthrow
              the distinction between Bishops
              and Presbyters;
              and yet till he has
              done
              that, he will in vain seek for an
              Independent Congregational Church in Antiquity.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. But that which he promises
            himself more Success in, is
            to prove, that there were
            no other but Congregational Churches,
            till the end of the second Century. But before we examine his
            Proofs
            of this, it will be necessary to inquire what he
            means
            by a Congregational Church.</p>
          <p>
            The Dean had
              proved
              that there were
              greater
              numbers
              of Christians
              in some particular
              Churches,
              such as <hi>Jerusalem, Corinth,
            
            
            Ephesus, c.</hi> than could meet together in one
              Congregation, which is
              a Demonstration,
              that a single Church, even in the
              Apostles
              times
              was
              larger
              than a single Congregation, Dr. <hi>O.</hi> himself
              granting,
              that there was
              but one Church in one City,
              whatever number of Christians
              may be supposed
              to be in it: And I do not remember,
              that ever I saw
              a man more uncertain what Answer to return to any Objection,
              than the Dr. is
              in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 1. he is
              not willing to own, that the Multitude of
              Christians
              in any City was
              greater
              than could meet in one single Congregation. He
              is
              willing to allow, that they had
              occasional Meetings,
              which did
              not consist of the whole Church,
              <hi>especially
              in times
              of Persecution---as may be proved</hi>
            
            <hi>by a Multiplication of Instances;
              but yet they continued
              one Church, and joyned
              together in all Acts
              of Church Communion properly
              so called:</hi>
              So that tho they might meet occasionally
              in parts,
              yet they used
              to worship God in one Body and one place, and so
              supposes,
              that there never were
              greater
              numbers
              in a Church than could meet together
              for acts
              of Worship. How then does
              he answer that Objection, <hi>from the Multiplication of
              Believers</hi>
              in several Churches,
              beyond the bounds
              of a single
            
            
            
            Congregation? This he says
              indeed is
              <hi>all the Difficulty,</hi> and if he cannot untie the
            
            Knot, he will cut it. For,
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. He answers,
              <hi>Whatever Difficulty may seem to be in this matter, yet
              in point of Fact so it was,
              there was
              no Church before the end of the second Century, of any other
              Species, Nature, or Kind, but a particular
              Congregational
              Church only.</hi> This is
              great, to despise
            
            those Difficulties
              which he cannot answer.
              But how does
              this matter of Fact appear? Suppose he could prove, that
              <hi>de facto</hi> in some Churches
              there were
              no more Christians
              than met
              in one Congregation which no body that I know of,
              denies:
              yet here are two other matters
              of Fact as plain as that, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That there
              was
              but one Church in a City, how large or
              populous
              soever it were.
              2. That in some Cities
              there were
              more Christians
              than could possibly
              meet in one Congregation, for Acts
              of Worship; and therefore such Churches
              could not be Congregational Churches,
              which require local and present Communion of all their
              Members.
              We do not oppose some Guesses
              and Conjectures
              to a certain matter of _ast,
              which is
              an
              absurd and foolish way of reasoning,
              to prove that that cannot be, which we see
              is;
              but we oppose matter of _act
              to matter of
            
            
            Fact, which certainly
              destroys
              the Credit of all, if they cannot be
              reconciled;
              and therefore, suppose all the Examples
              he has
              given
              of Congregational Churches,
              out of Antiquity, were
              well proved,
              how does
              he reconcile these matters?
              That he can never do in his way, who
              places
              the essential
              form of a Church in a single Congregation;
              but we can, who assert, that a particular Church must
              consist but of one single Congregation, when there are no
              more Christians
              than can meet in one place, but that it may consist of more
              when there are; and therefore, if he would prove against us,
              that the essential Form of a Church
              consists
              in a single Congregation, he must either prove, that there
              never were
              in any City for two hundred years,
              more Christians
              than could meet in a single
              Congregation, or that where there
              were,
              there were
              more Churches
              than one in that City, or, that tho there
              were
              more Christians
              than could meet in one Congregation,
              yet there was
              but one Congregational
              Church: but I fear he will complain
              again of this, as a very <hi>unpleasing Labour.</hi>
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. And he does
              indeed make a very bold attempt, to prove that there
              was
              but one Congregational Church in such
              Cities
              as
            
            
            
            had
              more Christians
              by half or two thirds
              than could meet in the same Congregation:
              <hi>For</hi> (sayes
              he) <hi>not all, not, it may be, half, not
              sometimes
              a third part, of them
              who made
              profession of the truth, and attended
              unto the
              preaching
              of the word; nay, many of whom
              underwent
              Martyrdom, were
              admitted
              as compleat
              Members
              of the Church, unto all the parts
              of its
              Communion. Hence there were
              many, who, upon a general account,
              were
              esteemed
              Christians,
              and that justly,
              where the Churches
              were
              but small.</hi> Thus it is,
              if we will take Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s word for it, for he
              does
              not offer at the least proof. But I answer,
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. If Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can
            shew
            me any one Instance,
            in all Antiquity, of any baptized
            Christian who was
            not in compleat
            Communion with
            the Church, unless he were
            under Age, or under Censures,
            I think he will do more towards
            the proof of an
            Independent Congregational Church, than
            has
            been
            done
            yet.</p>
          <p n="2">
            2. It is
              very true, in the second Century,
              every one who profess'd to believe in Christ,
              was
              not immediately
              baptized,
              but kept
              in a probation state, and instructed
              in the Principles
              of Religion, and trained
              up in the practise of it, as long as the Church
              saw
              fit, and such Persons
              were
              called
              <hi>Catechumens;</hi>
              yet these
            
            
            very men
              constantly
              attended
              the publick
              Congregation, as the Penitents
              themselves did,
              though they were
              not admitted
              to the Prayers
              of the Faithful, nor the Supper
              of our Lord; and therefore these
              men
              took
              up as much room in the Church as if they
              had
              been
              in compleat
              Communion, and so this evasion can do
              him
              no Service. And yet,

          <p n="3">3. This part of Discipline
            was
            not practis'd in the Apostles
            times;
            then men
            were
            baptized
            as soon as they profess'd their Faith in Christ, and
            joyned
            in all Christian Ordinances
            with the Church, and yet in these
            dayes
            we find numbers
            too big for single Congregations.</p>
          <p n="4">4. Supposing
            all these Christians
            had
            been
            admitted
            to compleat
            Communion, (as I suppose he will not deny but they might be,
            unless he thinks
            they must take their turns,
            and stay till there were
            room to receive them)
            could they be contained
            in one Congregation or not? if they could, then he might have
            spared
            all this, for it is
            nothing to the purpose; if they could not, must there be
            another Congregational
            Church erected
            in the same City to receive them?
            or must they continue
            Christians
            at large without constant Personal Communion with any
            Church?</p>
          
          
          
          <p>But, thirdly,
            he sayes,
            <hi>It does
            not appear, that
            in the next Age after the Apostles
            the Churches
            were
            any where so increased
            in number, as to bear the least proportion with the
            Inhabitants
            of the Cities
            and Towns
            wherein they were.</hi>
            Supposing
            this, yet if they were
            larger
            than to be contained
            in one worshipping
            Assembly,
            it is
            a sufficient Demonstration against Congregational
            Churches.
            As for what he alledges
            of the Churches
            of <hi>Smyrna, Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> that by their
            own Epistles
            they appear to be so small, <hi>as that it
            was
            scarcely
            known
            who or what they were.</hi>
            I can find no such intimation
            in those Epistles:
            there were
            a great many Christians
            that were
            not known
            to be so, such as <hi>Vettius Pagatus,</hi> a Person of great
            Nobility and Authority, who was
            not known
            to be a Christian till he appeared
            as an
            Advocate for the Christians,
            and being
            asked
            the Question, openly
            owned
            himself to be a Christian; but this
            was
            not owing
            to the smallness of their numbers,
            but to their great care in concealing
            themselves in times
            of persecution.</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. As for the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> what he
              sayes
              about their <hi>coming
              together in one</hi>
            
            <hi>place,</hi> I shall consider
              presently;
              but as for that Geographical dispute about <hi>Pella,</hi>
              though we should allow it to be but a
            
            
            small place, (which yet it does
              not appear to be, as the Dean has
              proved)
              yet we may easily
              suppose it big enough to receive more than a Congregational
              Church, and then it is
              sufficient for our purpose; for he cannot prove from the
              smallness of <hi>Pella,</hi> that there
              was
              but one Congregational Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> if it
              were
              big enough but to hold three or four Congregational
              Churches.
          </p>
          <p>I doubt not but <hi>Dr. O.</hi>
            was
            at least jealous,
            that he could not by such little
            Arts
            defend himself from those clear
            proofs,
            that there were
            more Christians
            in some Cities,
            than could meet together in one Congregation for constant
            Communion, where there was
            but one Church, which therefore could not be a Congregational
            Church: and therefore he has
            another ingenious fetch, which, I confess, I
            was
            very much
            pleased
            with when I read it. For,</p>

            2. Though he will not own the numbers
              of Christians
              to be so great in any City
              for two hundred years,
              as to make more Congregations
              than one necessary for Religious
              Worship, which had
              been
              too plainly
              to give up his Cause; yet, he says,
              that
            
            <hi>the multiplication</hi> (of a Church) <hi>into more
              Congregations
              without distinct Officers,
              will not at all help the Cause he</hi> (the <hi>Dean)
              pleadeth
            
            
            
            for: for his Diocesan Church consisteth
              of many distinct Churches,
              with their distinct Officers,
              Order, and Power, as he afterwards
              describes
              our Parishes
              to do under one Bishop.</hi> And therefore, a little after,
              he acquaints
              the Dean what he must prove if <hi>he would advantage his
              Cause,</hi> viz. <hi>that there
              were
              in</hi>
            
            <hi>one City, or any where else, many, not
              occasional
              Assemblies
              of Christians
              or Church-members,
              but many stated,
              fixed
              Churches,
              with Officers
              of their own, peculiarly
              related
              unto them,
              intrusted
              with Church-power and Privileges,
              at least, as much as he afterwards
              pleads
              to be in our Parochial Churches,
              all under the
              Government of one single Bishop,
              making
              up a new Church-state, beyond that of particular
              Congregations,
              by their relation unto
              him,
              as their common Pastor.</hi> If he can keep the Dean to
              this, I believe truly
              he has
              him
              safe for two hundred years
              at least after Christ. But I have two
              things
              to say to this.

          <p n="1">
            1. That if the D. can prove, that there
              were
              more than one ordinary and stated
              Assemblies
              for Worship in one Church or City, he
              sufficiently
              overthrows
              Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Proofs
              of a Congregational Church, which by the Institution of our
              Saviour, and to serve the necessary
              ends
              for which Churches
              were
              instituted
              (as he endeavours
              to
            
            
            prove) must consist only of one
              worshipping
              Assembly.
              Occasional Assemblies
              I grant do not so plainly
              overthrow Congregational
              Churches,
              because, still all the Members
              of such a Church, which upon occasion,
              may sometimes
              meet a-part for some Acts
              of Worship; yet, on set and solemn
              times,
              as suppose on the Lord's day, may, and must, and do meet
              together in one place; but if the Church
              consists
              of so many Members,
              that not half, nor a third or fourth part, can worship in
              the same place, this can be no longer
              a Congregational
              Church, because they are not one, but many
              Congregations;
              and we must not call these occasional
              Assemblies,
              (under which Word, Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              conceals
              his Fallacy) but fixed
              and stated
              Congregations,
              these supernumerary Congregations
              upon the Multiplication of Christians,
              being
              as perpetually
              necessary (if he will allow all
              Christians
              bound
              to worship God in publick
              Assemblies)
              as the first Mother Church or Congregation
              was.
              And therefore, when the Dean proves,
              that all the Christians
              in a City, and the adjacent parts,
              made
              but one Church, and that there were
              greater
              numbers
              of Christians
              in such a particular City,
              than could meet in one Congregation: I cannot see what more
              is
              necessary, to
            
            
            
            prove that such a Church was
              not a Congregational
              Church; and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has
              no way that I know of, to answer this, but either to prove
              that there were
              not more Christians
              in <hi>Jerusalem, Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> or any other City,
              than could meet in one Congregation, which he
              has
              not done
              yet and can never do, or else as the <hi>D.</hi>
              desired,
              <hi>That when the Christians
              in one City</hi>
            
            <hi>multiplyed
              into more Congregations,
              they did
              make new and distinct Churches.</hi>
              I confess this was
              an
              unreasonable desire, but he must not blame the D. but the
              Unreasonableness
              of his own Hypothesis for it. And thus the D. might well
              say, that <hi>distinct Churches
              in the same City was
              the thing to be proved,</hi>
              and it is
              a boyish piece of Sophistry,
              for the Dr. to answer, <hi>This
              was
              not</hi>
            
            <hi>the thing to be proved,
              nor did
              I propose it to Confirmation, nor assert it, but have
              proved
              the contrary unto the end of the second
              Century. This
              only I assert, that every Church in one City
              was
              only one Church, and nothing is
              offered
              by the Dr. to the contrary, yea he
              affirms
              the same.</hi> Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> indeed
              affirms,
              that there was
              but one Church in a City, but he
              does
              not surely
              affirm the same with Dr. <hi>O.</hi> who
              says,
              that there was
              but one Congregational Church in a City, when he ought to
              have proved,
              there had
              been
            
            
            more, if he would prove Congregational
              Churches.
              Learned
              men
              never betake themselves to such little
              Arts,
              but when their cause is
              desperate, and they resolved
              not to yield: thus we see the multiplication
              of Churches
              into more Congregations
              without erecting
              them
              into new distinct Churches,
              was
              sufficient to confute the Dr's Pleas
              for Congregational Churches.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. This is
            sufficient also, to prove what we now call a Diocesan Church,
            which is
            nothing else, but several Congregations
            under the Care, Government, and Inspection of a Bishop and his
            Presbyters;
            no says
            Dr. <hi>O.</hi> this is
            not enough, unless he proves,
            that <hi>there were
            many fixed
            Churches
            with Officers
            of their own, peculiarly
            related
            unto them---all under the Government of one single
            Bishop,</hi> c. For such our Parish
            Churches
            now are.</p>
          <p>
            In answer to this, let us put the case, that a Diocese
              were
              not divided
              into distinct
              Titles
              and Parishes,
              with their fixt
              Presbyters,
              (as we cannot find they were
              for two hundred years)
              but throughout
              the Diocese, at convenient distances,
              there were
              Chappels
              or Oratories
              erected
              for the exercise of religious Worship; and the Bishop should
              appoint his Presbyters,
              sometimes
              to attend one Cure, and
            
            
            
            sometimes
              another, with Authority to preach the Word, to administer
              Sacraments,
              and to perform all those religious
              Offices,
              which now the fixt
              Presbyters,
              or the setled
              Ministers
              of every
              Parish-Church are bound
              to perform: this is
              nothing more than a Church consisting
              of several Congregations,
              under the Government of one Bishop and his
              Presbyters;
              and can it be thought in the judgment
              of any impartial man to alter the frame and constitution of
              this Church. If these Presbyters,
              who supply the whole Diocese by
              turns,
              should have their particular
              Cures
              allotted,
              where they should constantly
              fix, and for which they should be accountable to their
              Bishop; the only
              difference is,
              that this last way is
              more for the edification of the Church,
              without
              altering
              the nature or species of Government.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is
              time now to consider how he proves
              both from the practise of the Apostles,
              and the next Ages,
              that Christian Churches
              were
              only single Congregations:
              and,
            
            as to the Apostles
              times,
              he has
              three Arguments,
              which will soon be answered.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            
            
            1. Because <hi>there were
              many Churches
              planted
              by the Apostles
              in very small Provinces,</hi>
              but they were
              Provinces
              in which were
              several Cities;
              for we no where find, that the Apostles
              planted
              Churches
              in small Villages;
              but their ordaining
              Elders,
              , and , in every
              City, and every Church, is
              the same thing, as the Doctor well
              observed,
              from comparing
              <hi>Acts</hi>
              14. 22. with <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. And as for what he
              often
              urges
              out of the Epistle of <hi>Clemens,</hi>
              , <hi>that</hi> the
              Apostles
              <hi>preaching
              the Word through Regions
              and Cities,
              they appointed
              the first fruits,
              or first converts
              of them
              for Bishops
              and Deacons,
              of them
              that should afterwards
              believe:</hi> though the signification of
               is
              ambiguous, and there is
              no need of expounding
              it of Villages;
              so as a learned
              man has
              observed,
            
            there is
              no necessity of saying
              that the Apostles
              appointed
              Bishops
              and Deacons
              in Villages
              as well as Cities,
              but that they preached
              in Cities
              and Villages;
              for they did
              not ordain Bishops
              whereever
              they preached.
              But what <hi>Clemens</hi> says,
              that the Apostles
              appointed
              Bishops
            
            
            
            for those who should afterwards
              believe, is
              a plain Answer to what he objects,
              <hi>That in four years
              after the ascension of Christ, there
              were
              Churches
              planted
              in all Judea, Galilee and Samaria, which
              was
              so short a time after the preaching
              of the Gospel, as that it is
              impossible they should be conceived
              to be any other but single Congregations.</hi>
              For though we might reasonably
              account for this, from that miraculous power which
              accompanied
              the preaching
              of the Gospel in those days,
              yet we see this Apostolical Writer
              tells
              us, that the Apostle laid
              the foundations
              of Churches
              in many places,
              not with respect only to those who
              were
              converted
              to the Faith, but to those also which should be; and a
              Church from a small beginning
              may soon increase beyond the proportion of a
              single
              Congregation.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. His second Argument for
            Congregational
            Churches
            is,
            <hi>The Apostles
            appointing
            in them
            ordinary Elders
            and Deacons:</hi>
            But this I have already considered.</p>
          <p n="3">
            3. He argues,
              That <hi>it is
              said
              of most of these Churches
              expresly,
              that they respectively
              met
              together in one place, or had
              their Assemblies
              of the whole Church for the discharge of the
              duties
              required
              of them,
            
            
            which is
              peculiar unto Congregational Churches.</hi>
              He names
              several places,
              which I shall briefly
              consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            <hi>Acts</hi>
              15. 12, 22. The place concerns
            
            the first general Council at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> In the
              12<hi>th.</hi> Verse we read, that <hi>the whole multitude
              was
              silent, while Barnabas and Saul
              declared
              what signs
              and wonders
              God had
              done
              among the Gentiles
              by them.</hi>
              Now  does
              certainly
              signifie,
              that there were
              a great many Disciples
              present, and that all that were
              present, were
              silent, and it can signifie
              no more: for though I grant the  or
              multitude
              does
              sometimes
              signifie
              the whole body of Christian people, as 
              or Congregation does
              the whole Catholick
              Church, yet when it is
              applied
              to a particular
              Meeting,
              it can signifie
              no more than are present at that time; and it
              does
              not necessarily
              signifie
              the whole number of Christians,
              unless it be expresly
              said,
              that they were
              all present, which is
              not probable at such a Meeting
              as this was,
              which was
              not for Religious Worship, but for advice and counsel;
              especially
              when we are so expresly
              told,
              that the first Christians
              met
              in distinct Assemblies,
              for the exercise of Christian Worship,
              <hi>breaking
              bread from house to house.</hi> And
            
            
            
            
            though this Meeting
              is
              called
              the whole Church, <hi>v.</hi> 22. yet it
              is
              most probable that  there only
              signifies
              an
              Assembly
              of Christians,
              not properly
              a Christian
              Church; and my Reason for it is
              this, That the whole Church in this place
              is
              distinguished
              from the Apostles
              and Elders,
              and so only signifies
              the believing
              people; and they are not a formal
              organized
              Church, when considered
              by themselves,
              but only a multitude or Assembly;
              and therefore the whole Church, <hi>v.</hi> 22. can have no
              other signification than all the multitude, <hi>v.</hi> 12.
              that is,
              the whole Assembly
              of private Christians
              then present.
              My other Reason is,
              Because the whole multitude of Believers
              were
              not then present; for this being
              a Council of the Apostles,
              to be sure Women
              were
              not admitted
              to these Debates,
              who yet are Members
              of the Church, and probably
              not inferiour
              in number to the men.
              So that though we should grant, that all the
              men
              who then were
              Members
              of the Christian Church were
              met
              together into one place, it does
              not hence follow, that the whole Church at
              <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was
              no larger
              than a single Congregation, because
              Wives
              and Virgins,
              and Widows,
              Children
              and Servants,
              who cannot be
            
            
            presumed
              present at this Council, must at least be
              allowed
              to make another Congregation, as large and numerous as this
              Council was.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second Text he directs
              us to, is
              an
              excellent confirmation of what I have now
              said:
              <hi>Acts</hi>
              21. 22. <hi>The multitude</hi>
            
            <hi>must needs
              come together;</hi> where by multitude
              he must understand the whole body
              of Christians,
              if he will apply it to his purpose. Let us then consider
              what this multitude is,
              and that we may learn from <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou
              seest
              Brother how many</hi>
            
            <hi>thousand of the Jews
              there are which believe,
              and they are all zealous of the Law;</hi>
              , which evidently
              denotes
              a number too great to meet in one
              Assembly,
              to take an
              account of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching
              and Conversation: And yet this is
              the multitude which must come together;
              which is
              a plain demonstration, that multitude here
              does
              not signifie
              the whole body of Christian <hi>Jews,</hi>
              but such a number of them
              as will and can meet together, which are therefore
              called
              the multitude, because a great number will meet, and that no
              particular persons
              are ap_ointed,
              but every one comes
              that will and can; and this is
              all I alledge
              it for: For I do not suppose, that these vast
            
            
            
            numbers
              of <hi>Jews</hi>
              which were
              now at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
              were
              all constant Inhabitants
              there, and fixed
              Members
              of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but a great many of
              them
              resorted
              to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the time of the Feast, from all
              parts
              of <hi>Judea,</hi> and other neighbouring
              Provinces:
              But all that I prove from hence
              is,
              that a <hi>multitude</hi> does
              not always
              signifie
              the whole body of Christian people, but as many of
              them
              as can meet together in one place, though it bear no
              proportion to the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only I shall hence observe two things
              by the way, which do not very well
              comply with the
              Nature and Constitution of Congregational
              Churches,
              for which the Doctor now pleads.
              1. That these Christian <hi>Jews,</hi>
              who were
              not fixed
              Members
              of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet when they
              were
              occasionally
              there, thought themselves as much
              concerned
              in all publick
              Affairs
              of the Church, and any publick
              Meetings
              and Councils,
              which concerned
              Church-matters,
              as the fixt
              Members
              of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
              did;
              for it was
              for the satisfaction of those many thousand
              believing
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              who were
              then occasionally
              at <hi>Jerus___m,</hi>
              as well as for the fixed
              Members
              of that Church, <hi>that the multitude must come
              together.</hi>
            
            
            2. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> is
              here bound
              to give an
              account of his Doctrine and Conversation, in other
              Churches
              of his own planting
              in remote Countreys,
              before the
              Church of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> both which suppose, that all
              Christians
              then, whatever particular Churches
              they belonged
              to, looked
              upon themselves but as one body; and that they
              had
              equal Rights
              and Priviledges
              in any Church where they came,
              as in their own; and that the greatest
              Apostles
              themselves were
              not independent, but liable to give
              an
              account to other Churches
              of their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would desire Dr. <hi>O.</hi> at his leisure to consider,
              how like this looks
              to the Constitution
              and Government of an
              independent
              Congregation. He refers
              also to <hi>Asts</hi> 5. 11. which
              mentions
              the Church
            
            indeed, but does
              not so much as intimate,
              that the whole Church was
              then present; for fear might come upon the whole Church,
              from that dreadful example
              of Apostolical power and discipline
              executed
              on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> though not the
              tenth
              part of them
              were
              present when it was
              done.
              Thus <hi>Acts</hi>
              6. 2. it is
              said,
              <hi>The twelve called
              the multitude of the Disciples
              unto them;</hi>
              but we have already
            
            
            
            seen,
              that the multitude does
              not necessarily
              signifie
              the whole body of Christians;
              here was
              a general Summons,
              but no more could come, than could be
              contained
              in one place, and yet it may well be
              called
              the multitude, when no man is
              excepted:
              and this not concerning
              acts
              of Worship, such a multitude as could come
              was
              sufficient, when the decision
              of the matter did
              not depend upon number of Votes,
              but the Apostolical Authority. The same Answer may serve to
              the instance of the Church at <hi>Antioch,
              Acts</hi>
              14. 27. if we will suppose that there
              were
              at that time more Disciples
              at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
              than could meet together in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last instance he gives,
              is
              in the Practice of the Church of <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor.</hi>
              14. 25, 26. though I suppose it should be the three and
              twentieth
              Verse where the great difficulty
              lyes.
              <hi>If therefore the</hi>
            
            <hi>whole Church be come together into one place---when ye
              come together, every one of you
              hath
              a</hi> Psalm, c. So that it
              seems
              the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
              did
              meet together for Acts
              of Worship in one place, and therefore
              was
              but one single Congregation. Now there are two
              things
              wherein this whole difficulty
            
            
            consists.
              1. Whether the <hi>whole Church
              meeting
              together,</hi> does
              necessarily
              imply their meeting
              in one Religious Assembly;
              for may not the whole Church of
              <hi>England</hi>
              be truly
              and properly
              said
              to meet together for Christian Worship, though they meet in
              several distinct, but not separate
              Congregations;
              for the whole Church meeting
              together for Worship signifies
              no more, but that all the Members
              of the Church do Worship God in the
              Publick
              Assemblies
              of the Church, though not all in the same
              Assembly
              and Congregation. And that the Apostle
              means
              no more here, is
              very plain from that direction he
              gives
              about Women,
              <hi>v. 34. Let your Women
              keep silence in the</hi>
            
            <hi>Churches,</hi>
              , which in the Thirty fifth Verse
              is
              immediately
              called
            
             <hi>in the Church,</hi> which
              plainly
              signifies,
              that there was
              but <hi>one Church</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> thereby
              signifying
              the whole Company of Christians
              united
              in one Communion, but yet there
              were
              several
              Religious Assemblies,
              which he calls
              Churches,
              wherein this one Church met,
              and the meeting
              of the Church in these Publick
              Assemblies
              for Worship, is
              called
              <hi>the meeting
              together of the whole Church.</hi>
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            
            
            
            2. But still there appears
              to be some difficulty in that Phrase ,
              which our Translators
              render <hi>in one place, if therefore the whole Church be
              come together
              into one place;</hi> for certainly
              this can signifie
              but one single Congregation, or one
              Assembly.
              I answer, it is
              very plain, that 
              does
              not alwayes
              signifie
              one place; as is
              evident from <hi>Acts</hi>
              4. 26, 27. <hi>The Kings
              of the Earth stood
              up, and the Rulers
              were
              gathered
              together  against the Lord and against
              his Christ, for of a truth against thy Holy Child</hi>
              Jesus,
              <hi>both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>and the
              People of</hi> Israel <hi>were
              gathered
              together:</hi> where being
              gathered
              together  must
              signifie
              no more than an
              agreement and Conspiracy in one design, not a
              meeting
              in one place; For <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius
              Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              and the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> never
              met
              together in one place for any such Consultation. Another use
              of the word we find in <hi>Acts</hi>
              2. 44. <hi>and all that believed
              were
              together
              () and had
              all things
              common:</hi>
              which being
              together, does
              not refer to their Religious Assemblies,
              but their common abode, and unless Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can
              prove, that there were
              no more Christians
              in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> after three
              thousand
            
            
            were
              Converted
              by one Sermon, than could live in one House, as well as meet
              in one Assembly,
               must not signifie
              one place, and then certainly
              the Christian Church may be said
              to meet  in several
              Congregations,
              as dwell  in several
              Houses.
              The Christians
              being
              together in the same place can signifie
              no more, than that they choose to live together in the same
              houses
              without intermixing
              with unbelieving
              Jews,
              not that they all lived
              together in
              the same house, which could not be; and thus to meet
              together in one place, signifies
              that they all met
              together to
              Worship in Christian Assemblies,
              not that they all met
              in the same Assembly.
              The very same Objection he urges
              from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17, 20. and the same Answer will
              serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us now consider, what evidence he
              produces
              for Congregational Churches,
              from the Ages
              next after the Apostles,
              till the end of the Second Century: and upon the most strict
              Examination I can make, of his Historical account of the
              State of the First Churches,
              I can find but two things
              he designs
              to prove by it, and if he can prove
              them,
              it is
              as much to the purpose, as if they
              were
              two hundred.
            
            
            
            1. That the whole number of Christian People
              belonging
              to one particular
              Church, met
              together in one and the same place, at the same time for
              Religious
              Worship. 2. That the exercise of Discipline, and the
              management of all Church affairs,
              Writing
              Letters
              or sending
              Messengers
              to other Churches,
              <hi>c.</hi> was
              all transacted
              in the presence and with the consent of the whole Church,
              which therefore could be no longer
              than could meet together in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the first of these, he proves
              it by those Phrases
              and Expressions
              used
              in Ancient Writers,
              concerning
              Church-Assemblies
              for Worship, that they used
              to come together in one place,  and put
              up one Prayer in common, and this
              was
              done
              by those who dwelt
              in the City and neighbouring
              Fields
              or Villages.
              To this purpose he refers
              to several passages
              in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles,
              <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> all very
              credible
            
            witnesses
              of Primitive Practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now as for what concerns
              these Phrases
              of meeting
              together in one place, and the like I have already
              showed,
              that they do not necessarily
              signifie
              the meeting
              of the whole Church at the same
            
            
            time, in one and the same place; but only that Christian
              Worship was
              performed
              in Christian Assemblies
              whither all Christians
              used
              to resort, in one if their numbers
              would permit, or in more if they could not, so it
              were
              in the Communion
              of their Bishop and Fellow Christians.
              But for a farther confirmation of this we consider.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. That <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote
              these Epistles
              in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> after he
              was
              Condemned
              to be carried
              thither, and thrown
              to Wild Beasts,
              which was
              about the year 107. and it is
              not credible, that the Churches
              he directed
              his Letters
              to, planted
              in populous Cities,
              and founded
              by the Apostles
              themselves so long before, should have no
              greater
              numbers
              of Christians
              than could all meet in one Congregation,
              especially
              considering,
              that not only all the Christians
              in a City, but in neighbouring
              Villages,
              were
              reckoned
              but one Church; as to instance in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a City
              of great Fame, where St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              Preached
              three years
              with admirable
              success, <hi>where those who studied</hi>
            
            <hi>curious Arts
              burnt their Magical Books,
              and they counted
              the price of them,
              and found it Fifty thousand pieces
              of Silver, so mightily
              grew
              the word of God and prevailed:</hi>
            
            
            
            one can hardly
              imagine, that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time there should be
              but one Congregation of Christians,
              when he had
              Preached
              so long among them,
              <hi>that all they which dwelt
              in</hi> Asia <hi>heard
              the word of the Lord Jesus, both
              Jews
              and Greeks,</hi>
              and with such success, as was
              admired
              even in those dayes
              of Wonders
              and Miracles.
              Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> placed
              <hi>Timothy</hi> himself Bishop, who
              was
              his Companion and Fellow-labourer, and of the same mind and
              Spirit with him;
              and we may reasonably
              presume, that the Church of God would
              encrease
              and flourish under his instructions
              and Government. And therefore <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his
              Letter to them,
              takes
              notice of their  <hi>numerous
              multitude,</hi> and it is
              strange that this should be no more than one Congregation,
              after so many years
              encrease
              and growth. And yet this is
              the Church, which he exhorts
              to meet together in one place.

            2. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> wrote
              his Second Apology to the <hi>Roman</hi>
              Emperour
              in the behalf of the Christians,
              as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> sayes,
              about the year 150. though others
              assign another time for it: and
            
            being
              at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Writing
              to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours,
              we need not doubt
            
            
            but he had
              that Church in his Eye, in that description he
              gives
              of the Order of
              Christian Worship, and yet there he
              sayes
              . <hi>That on the day
              called
              Sunday, all that dwell in the Cities
              or Countries
              about, meet
              together in one place.</hi> So that if we will understand
              this strictly,
              we must own that in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and all the
              Country about for a hundred and fifty
              years
              or more after Christ, there was
              but one Congregation of Christians,
              and it is
              wonderful, that so inconsiderable
              a number of people, who took
              so much care to conceal themselves
              from their Persecuting
              Enemies,
              should be thought worth taking
              notice of in so
              great and flourishing
              a City, which was
              the Seat of the Empire,
              and yet about this time began
              the Fifth Persecution, in which <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
              himself suffered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed there is
              no such thing can be concluded
              from <hi>Justin</hi>'s words,
              or we must prove more from it, than the
              Doctor would
              have, or than any body can grant; for <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
              does
              not here speak of a particular Church, but of
              several
              Churches,
              planted
              in several Cities
            
            
            
            and neighbour-Villages,
              (for there was
              but one Church in a City, as the Doctor
              owns)
              and yet says,
              that they all meet on Sunday, , in the
              same place; and if he will interpret this so
              strictly,
              as to signifie
              one Congregation or Religious
              Assembly,
              then not only one, but many Churches,
              met
              together in one Congregation; and if he will not allow this,
              then  does
              not signifie
              one particular Congregation; and the same Church may be as
              properly
              said
              to meet, , in distinct
              Congregations,
              as many Churches
              may, which confirms
              what before I observed
              of the use of this phrase; and Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              seems
              to have been
              so sensible of this, that in citing
              that passage
              out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> he
              durst
              not translate , but
              puts
              it only into these general words,
              <hi>On the day called</hi>
            
            <hi>Sunday, there is
              a Meeting
              of all that dwell in the Towns
              and Fields,
              or Villages
              about;</hi> which I hope may be true, though they do not
              meet all in one place.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. To confirm this, let us next
              consider the
              Testimonies
              produced
              by him
              out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Apology: And here I find
              nothing but gross Prevarication; and it
              was
              impossible to find any thing in <hi>Tertullian</hi> to his
              purpose without it.
            
            
            <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes
              no notice of any particular
            
            Church, but gives
              an
              account of the general practice of Christian
              Churches,
              which he calls
              the <hi>Christiana factio,</hi> not the <hi>Christian
              Religion,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              translates
              it, but the <hi>Christian Faction,</hi> which he so
              calls
              in contempt of that opprobrious
              Name given
              them
              by the Heathens;
              or because <hi>Factio</hi> was
              anciently
              a good Name, to signifie
              an
              innocent and vertuous
              Combination, Sect, or Party of men,
              united
              for the doing
              some good and vertuous
              Actions;
              and therefore immediately
              before he tells
              them,
              that they ought at least to reckon the
              Christian
              Sect <hi>inter licitas Factiones,</hi> among the lawful
              Factions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of this Christian Faction or Church,
            
            he tells
              them,
              <hi>Corpus sumus de conscientia Religionis, 
              disciplinae unitate,  spei foedere: We are a Body or
              Society, united
              in a consent of Religion, unity of discipline, and Covenant
              of hope.</hi> This <hi>Tertullian</hi> writes of the whole
              Christian Church, or of all Christians,
              this being
              a general Apology for Christians,
              not for any particular
              Christian Church; but Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would have
              him
              mean this of a particular
              Congregational Church, and therefore
              by the Covenant of hope understands
            
            
            
            the independent Church-Covenant;
              and at this rate of dealing
              with ancient Writers,
              he may find an
              independent
              Church in what Author he pleases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <hi>Tertullian</hi> proceeds,
              <hi>Coimus ad Deuns quasi manu facta precationibus ambiamus;
              We meet together, that with united
              force we may obtain the favour of God by our
              prayers.</hi>
              Here Dr. <hi>O.</hi> makes
              use of old Editions
              of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and adds,
              what is
              wanting
              in the latest
              and best Editions,
              <hi>In Coetum  Congregationem, We meet in
              an
              Assembly
              or Congregation;</hi> but the matter
              is
              not much, which way soever it be; I
              am
              sure he translates
              or expounds
              it very false, when from these words
              he observes,
              that <hi>Tert. lays
              the foundation of Churches</hi>
            
            <hi>in their Meetings,
              in the same Assembly
              or Congregation:</hi> For <hi>Tert.</hi>
              does
              not here speak of any particular, but of the
              universal
              Church; and though he makes
              it essential to the Church, that there should be
              publick
              Assemblies
              for Religious Worship,
              yet he no where intimates,
              that a particular Church must be no
              larger
              than a single Congregation. If fondness for a particular
              Opinion can thus blind mens eyes,
              there is
              no hope of ever convincing
              them;
              or if it can tempt them
              with
            
            
            their eyes
              open, to impose upon others, (who see with their
              eyes)
              in so plain a case, there is
              less hope still.
          </p>
          <p>
            I confess it was
              a bold adventure for any man to call in <hi>Tertullian</hi>
              as a Witness for Congregational
              Churches,
              to prove, suppose that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
              the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he
              was
              <hi>Presbyter,</hi> there were
              no more Christians
              in his time than would make up one
              single
              Congregation, when immediately
              before <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells
              them,
              <hi>Though we</hi> (Christians)
              <hi>have risen
              but of late among you, yet we</hi>
            
            <hi>have filled
              all places
              with our numbers,
              your Cities,
              Castles,
              Forts,
              Councils,
              Camps,
              Tribes,
              Palaces,
              Senate,
              Judicatures;
              we leave only your Temples
              to your selves;</hi>
              he tells
              them,
              They need not doubt of their courage and fitness for War,
              who so tamely
              suffer
              themselves to be killed;
              <hi>Did
              not their Religion
              teach them
              rather to be killed
              than to kill?</hi> (this is
              no Independent Principle) nay, <hi>that they could revenge
              themselves on them
              without rebelling;
              for if such a vast
            
            
            
            number of men
              should but break company with them,
              and depart into some remote corner of the World, the loss of
              so many Citizens
              would confound their Empire, and punish
              them
              only by forsaking
              them;
              they would certainly
              be afraid of their own solitude, and that great silence of
              all things,
              and the lethargick
              stupor, as it were,
              of a dead World.</hi> And would any body now but Dr.
              <hi>O.</hi> believe, that in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time,
              there were
              no more Christians
              in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and other large and
              populous Cities,
              than might all meet in one single Congregation, though
              supposed
              as large and numerous as in reason may be
              imagined;
              five or six thousand people (which
              is
              a good large Congregation)
              could not easily
              be miss'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> where you may
              reasonably
              suppose some hundred thousands;
              and yet the case was
              the same in the Countreys
              as well as Cities,
              in proportion to the number of Inhabitants.

          <p>
            <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote
              this Apology not above 40 years
              or thereabout after <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
              wrote
              his; which is
              a plain Argument,
              that the number of Christians
              was
              not so small at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Justin</hi>'s time, as
              to make but one Congregation; for it
              is
              not credible to think, that when the
            
            
            Gospel had
              made
              no greater
              progress at <hi>Rome</hi> in a hundred and fifty
              years,
              than to make up a Church of one
              Congregation
              in forty years
              more, in the heat of persecutions,
              when Mir_cles
              were
              either ceased,
              or were
              very rare, it should so prodigiously
              over-run City and Countrey,
              as to equal, if not exceed the number
              of Infidels.

            4. <hi>Origen</hi> lived
              and flourished
              in <hi>Alexandria</hi>
              part of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, and to his Testimony now
              and then the Doctor appeals;
              and yet it is
              evident from numerous
              proofs,
              that in his days
              a Church consisted
              of more Congregations
              than one. I shall take notice at present but of one place,
              which the Dean has
              noted
              before me, that he compares
              the Churches
              of <hi>Athens, Corinth</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with
              the Corporations
              in those Cities,
              (which
            
            were
              not one but many) the number of
              <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              with the Senates

            And now if we should descend to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who
              was
              Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> not many
              years
              after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and had
              such a particular reverence for his Memory and
              Writings,
              that he called
              him
              his Master, and
              was
              the most zealous Assertor of the ancient Government and
              Discipline
            
            
            
            of the Church, it is
              hardly
              credible,
              that in such an
              Age of learned
              and inquisitive men,
              when their enemies
              had
              such a watchful eye over them,
              they should attempt any Innovation in
              Government
              or Worship, and if they did,
              that no notice should be taken
              of it either by Friends
              or Enemies.
              But Dr. <hi>O.</hi> dares
              not descend so low as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> since the Dean
              has
              so plainly
              proved,
              that he is
              not theirs, and therefore stops
              without any reason, and indeed ought to have
              stopped
              a great deal sooner,
              if he had
              consulted
              the advantage of his Cause: For there
              is
              no shew
              of reason to imagine, that the third Century
              produced
              any new Alterations
              in Church-Government, as the fourth might, when the Empire
              became
              Christian, and the Sword was
              added
              to the Keys;
              but the Testimonies
              of the third Century are too plain in this Cause, and the
              Records
              of former Ages
              not so express and particular, but that a man of
              w_ it
              may with some Art press them
              to serve his Cause.

          <p n="2">
            2. His second Argument to prove Congregational
              Churches
              from primitive Practice is,
              That the exercise of Discipline,
              and the management of all Church-Affairs,
              writing
              Letters
              or sending
              Messengers
            
            
            to other Churches,
              <hi>c.</hi> was
              all transacted
              in the presence and by the consent
              of the whole Church, which therefore
              could be no larger
              than could meet together in one place: And this
              is
              co-incident
              with the third thing I observed
              he endeavoured
              to prove in this History, <hi>viz.</hi> the Interest and
              Power of the People
              in Church-Government; this he over and over
              repeats,
              as the great support of his Cause, and the great thing he
              aims
            
            to prove, as you may see in the margin; for I forbear
              transcribing
              particular passages
              to save so much trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now if the Right and Power of the People in
              Church-Affairs
              were
              duely
              stated,
              I should have no great Controversie
              with him
              upon that score; for it is
              certainly
              agreeable to Apostolical and primitive
              Practice, that the People should at least be present and
              consenting
              at the Election of Officers,
              the exercise of the Keys,
              or making
              any new Rules
              or Orders
              of Discipline; but as for any inherent
              Power and Authority to determine these
              Matters,
              they had
              none, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> himself
              acknowledges,
              who rejects
              <hi>the Democratical Government of the Church,</hi> when he
              was
              charged
              with it by the Doctor, (though he
              had
              before plainly
            
            
            
            enough owned
              it) and tells
              his Readers,
              <hi>I never thought, I never wrote
              any such thing: I do believe that the Authoritative Rule and
              Government of the Church was,
              is,
              and ought to be in the Elders
              and Rulers
              of it, being
              an
              act of the Office-Power, committed
              to them
              by Christ himself. Howbeit
              my judgment
              is,
              that they ought not to rule the Church with Force, Tyranny,
              and corporal Penalties,
              or without their own consent.</hi> And thus he
              answers
              the Doctor's
              Objection, <hi>That it is
              very unlikely that the People would forego their Interest in
              the Government of the Churches,
              if ever they had
              any such thing, without great noise and trouble; for
              Government is
              so nice and tender a thing, that every one
              is
              so much concerned
              for his share in it, that men
              are not easily
              induced
              to part with it.</hi> To this he
              answers,
              <hi>No other interest or share in the Government
              is
              ascribed
              by us unto the People, but that they may be
              ruled
              by their own consent.---But from any
              engagement
              on their minds,
              from the sweetness
              of Government, wherein their Concern
              principally
              consists
              in an
              understanding
              voluntary obedience unto the Commands
              of Christ, they had
              nothing of it.</hi> It was
              very fitting,
              that at the Election of Bishops,
              the People who understood
              their
            
            
            Conversation and Temper, should at least be
              Witnesses
              and Judges
              of their moral qualifications;
              and if none were
              to be made
              a Bishop, but he who had
              a <hi>good report from those who are without,</hi>
              (Pagans
              and Infidels)
              it was
              much more unreasonable
              to advance any man to that degree, who
              had
              not a good report from the Church itself, and those people
              who were
              to be governed
              by him.
              Thus one design of Church-Censures
              is
              to put such persons
              to publick
              shame, and therefore is
              most regularly
              exercised
              in a publick
              Assembly,
              in the presence of neighbour-Christians,
              who must in some sort execute
              the sentence of Excommunication, which
              is
              inflicted
              by the Bishop, by withdrawing
              from the Conversation of such men.
              And thus People will yield a more willing and
              chearful
              obedience to Church-Rules
              and Orders,
              when they are established
              by their consent, which was
              especially
              necessary in those days,
              when there was
              no external Power to back the Authority of the Church, and
              which ought to be exercised
              as sparingly
              as may be, when other more grateful
              methods
              will attain the end: But of this more anon. But the Point I
              part with Dr. <hi>O.</hi> upon is
              this, That the presence of
            
            
            
            the whole Church is
              not necessary to this purpose, and that much
              greater
              numbers
              may meet upon such occasions
              as these, when there is
              need, than can be fixt
              Members
              of a Congregational
              Church, and therefore the right of the People in
              Church-affairs
              does
              not prove the necessity of Congregational
              Churches;
              and I have a plain reason and a plain example for the proof
              of this, which is
              as much as can be desired
              in any case.
          </p>
          <p>
            My reason is
              this, because the exercise
              of Church-Government does
              not depend upon the Votes
              of the People
              (which is
              to make Church-Government
              Democratical) for then indeed
              it were
              necessary that the whole Church should meet, or at least
              that they might, if they pleased;
              but their presence is
              required
              not to give Authority
              to Church-Decrees
              and Censures,
              but for their own satisfaction, that all
              things
              are managed
              with due Counsel and Advice, and as may be for the
              Edification of the Christian Church, and five hundred serve
              as well for this purpose as five thousand; for in such
              cases
              as these, that which will satisfie
              five hundred men,
              not pickt
              and culled
            
            
            out to make a Party, but coming
              occasionally
              without any particular design,
              must certainly
              satisfie
              all reasonable
              men,
              and those who love to see and hear for themselves may come
              themselves.
          </p>
          <p>And upon extraordinary occasions,
            there may be a more numerous Assembly
            than can meet in a single Congregation,
            as we know it has
            often been
            upon the choice of Bishops,
            not without great disorders
            from the heats
            and Factions
            of different Parties,
            which may and often do happen in less
            meetings;
            though the inconveniencies
            of this grew
            so great, that the Church saw
            fit to restrain this power, and the true reason of these
            disorders
            was,
            that by noise and tumult they made
            themselves
            Electors,
            instead of being
            Witnesses,
            and giving
            their consent to a wise choice.</p>
          <p>
            My example of the Exercise of this Discipline out of a
              Congregational Church, is
              the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
              time. I suppose Dr. <hi>O.</hi> will not now attempt to
              prove the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in St.
              <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time to have
              been
              a Congregational Church; for he himself
              acknowledges,
            
            
            
            <hi>that it is
              sufficiently
              manifest from his Epistles,
              that the Church of</hi> Carthage <hi>wherein he
              did
              preside, was
              so far a particular
              Church</hi> (a particular Church we grant, but not a
              Congregational Church) <hi>as that the whole body or
              Fraternity of</hi>
            
            <hi>it, was
              admitted
              unto all advice in things
              of Common Concernment unto the whole Church, and
              allowed
              the exercise of their Power and Liberty in
              choosing
              or refusing
              the Officers
              that were
              to be set over them.</hi>
              He sayes
              indeed something more than what
              is
              true of the Power of the People of <hi>Carthage</hi> in
              Church-affairs,
            
            as is
              evident from that accurate
              account the Dean has
              given
              of this matter, but yet thus much
              is
              true, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              did
              not ordinarily
              determine any
              matters
              of great and Publick
              concernment without the advice of his Clergy and the consent
              of the People, which is
              a plain demonstration
              that the rights
              of the People in Church-affairs
              may be preserved
              in a Church, which is
              not confined
              to a single Congregation. This I think
              is
              sufficient to return in Answer to Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Second
              Argument for Congregational Churches,
              from the Example of the
            
            
            Apostolical and Primitive Churches
              to the end of the Second Century.
          </p>
          <p n="3">3. His Third Argument to prove the Divine Institution
            of Congregational Churches
            is,
            <hi>that they only are suited
            unto the ends
            of Christ in the Institution
            of his Church,</hi> which he persues
            at large thorough the Sixth Chapter, but upon a perusal of it,
            I find it only a larger
            Repetition of his first Argument, to prove that Christ
            hath
            appointed
            the Congregational Church and State, because <hi>it
            is
            meet and accommodated
            unto all the ends
            which he designed
            in his Institution of a Church.</hi> And what I have already
            answered
            to that, is
            a sufficient answer to this, which if I
            understand
            aright is
            the very same, and though I could take advantage to
            discourse some
            things
            more largely,
            as he has
            done,
            yet I am
            contented
            to have said
            enough.</p>
          <p>
            Let us now consider Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Notion of
              <hi>Praesential Communion,</hi> and of all the
              Writers
              I know, I can least undertake to tell what Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
              opinion is
              in any thing; for sometimes
              he seems
              to say one thing, and sometimes
              another, and
              conceals
              himself under such doubtful and ambiguous
              expressions,
            
            
            
            that it is
              a hundred to one, if he do not charge his Answerer, whoever
              he be, with false citations,
              and mistaking
              his Sence,
              as he has
              served
              the Dean more than once, where I believe any Reader would
              have mistaken,
              as well as he, if it were
              a mistake, but this is
              a secure way to take care for a retreat, if he cannot
              conquer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his Answer to the Dean, he will
            
            by no means
              confine <hi>Present Communion</hi>
              to single Congregations,
              that <hi>must all meet at once in one place, but that as
              Neighbours
              and Citizens
              may have Personal
              Converse and meetings</hi>
              per vices,
              <hi>of some at one time and some at another,</hi> but at
              other times
              seems
              to be perfectly
              of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s
              mind for Congregational
              Communion, as I have already observed,
              and in his Treatise of Episcopacy
            
            expresly
              chuses
              that way, and therefore urges
              the same Arguments
              which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> does,
              and endeavours
              to answer that Objection of Presbyterians
              against the Independants
              Congregational
              Churches
              <hi>(which,</hi> as he sayes,
              <hi>is
              the common and strongest
              Objection against</hi>
            
            <hi>us,</hi> including
              himself in the number) <hi>from the multitude of
              Converts
              at</hi> Jerusalem
              <hi>and</hi> Ephesus, <hi>that they could not
            
            
            be one particular Church, so as to meet in one place:</hi>
              and one part of his Definition
              of a single Church, is
              <hi>a competent</hi>
            
            <hi>number of private Christians,
              as the guided
              part associated
              by consent,</hi> (which looks
              like an
              Independent Church-Covenant)
              <hi>for Personal, Presential, Holy Communion, in Holy
              Doctrine, Holy Worship of God, Holy Order, and Holy
              Conversation,</hi> the explication of which you may see more
              at large in what follows,
              where he endeavours
              to prove, that the end of Church-Society
              is
              for Presential Communion in Worship, which
              is
              exactly
              the Independent Notion,
              and makes
              no other exceptions
              than Dr. <hi>O.</hi> allows,
              that they may <hi>sometimes
              assemble apart by reason of Impediments,
              age, distance, weather, Persecution,</hi>
              c.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many things
              he urges,
              are the same we have already met
              with in Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and I do not see, but that the same
              Answers
              will serve; it is
              not consistent with my designed
              brevity, to examine particularly
              every thing he sayes,
              who sayes
              a great many things,
              which I can imagine no other reason for, but to make up in
              number, what they want in weight; much less shall I examine
            
            
            
            all his numerous citations
              out of Ancient
              Writers,
              who commonly
              does
              abound with such Citations,
              though with as little skill or Faithfulness as most
              men
              I know, some account of which will be
              given
              to the World, as I presume, before this discourse
              sees
              the Light; and therefore I shall only as
              briefly
              as I can consider the main force of his
              Arguments,
              whereon the whole hope of his cause
              depends.
          </p>
          <p>
            As 1. That which he designs
              to prove
            
            in his Tenth
              Chapter of the Treatise of Episcopacy
              is,
              <hi>that the lowest
              true Political Church, must be neighbours
              united
              for Personal Communion,</hi> which he
              proves
              from Apostolical and Primitive
              Churches
              of the first and second Ages,
              which I have already considered
              in answer to Dr. <hi>O. from the
              duties
              of Church-members,
              which are, 1. To assemble
              together for Gods
              Publick
              Service. 2. To have the same Pastors
              that are among them
              and over them,
              and Preach to them
              the word of God, and go before
              them
              by the example of a Holy Life. 3. To send to their
              Pastors
              when they are Sick to Pray with
              them,
              and to advise
              them.
              4. To admonish a Brother that offendeth,</hi>
              c. To which I answer.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            
            
            1. I readily
              grant, that neighbour Christians
              ought to live together in the same Church-Communion, and I
              think this is
              no very good Argument for Conventicles,
              which disturb the Communion of neighbour
              Christians,
              and pick up a Church from all parts
              of Town and Country, whose Members
              many times
              live at such a distance, that they never see one another but
              at their Meetings,
              much less are they capable
              of discharging
              the Offices
              of Church-Members
              to each other.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. But yet the Duties
              which Christians
              owe to each other, do not depend upon their
              being
              Members
              of the same particular Church, but on their
              common
              Christianity, or their being
              Members
              of the Catholick
              Church, which is
              the Body of Christ, and of the same Communion; such as
              exhorting,
              admonishing,
              reproving,
              counselling,
              comforting,
              relieving,
              <hi>c.</hi> Neighbourhood gives
              the opportunity of discharging
              these duties,
              but common Christianity layes
              the obligation on us to do it, and we are
              equally
              bound
              to perform these Offices
              of Christian Charity and Communion to all
              Christians,
              as we have opportunity, as we are to those
            
            
            
            who belong to that particular Church, whereof we are
              Members;
              and therefore
              there is
              no reason to confine the Communion of a particular Church to
              such a neighbourhood as will give us opportunity of such
              Christian Conversation,
              because this is
              not a peculiar
              duty of a particular Church-Relation,
              but of common Christianity; and while all
              Neighbours
              live in the same Communion, though the Communion of that
              particular Church extend much farther than the
              Neighbourhood, these duties
              may be as well performed,
              as if the particular Church-Society
              were
              confined
              to the Neighbourhood.
          </p>
          <p n="3">3. I willingly
            grant, That Religious Assemblies
            for Worship are necessary to the Christian Church, but deny,
            that a Church must be no larger
            than a worshipping
            Assembly,
            as I have already replied
            to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> for the duty of
            publick
            Worship does
            not depend on a particular Church-Relation, but on common
            Christianity;
            and I am
            equally
            bound
            to worship God with all the Christians
            in the World, where-ever I am,
            who worship our
            Saviour according
            to his own Institutions.</p>
          <p>
            The foundation of this whole Dispute
            
            
            is
              an
              opinion which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have
              embraced,
              that a Church-Member signifies
              something more than a Christian, and that the
              Members
              of the same particular
              Church are more nearly
              related
              to each other, than they are to the rest of the Christian
              World; and therefore none can be of the same Church, but
              those who pray, and hear, and receive the Lord's Supper
              together. But this is
              a schismatical Principle, destructive to the very notion of
              Catholick
              Communion; it is
              not any distinct duty from Catholick
              Christian Communion, but necessity
              which forms
              particular Churches;
              and if they can shew
              me any one duty, which Christians
              owe to their fellow-Members
              of any particular Church by vertue
              of a Church-Relation, which they do not by the
              Principles
              of common Christianity and Catholick
              Communion owe to all the Christians
              in the World, when they have opportunity to discharge it, I
              will yield the Cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the Christians
              of the World are Members
              of that one Body of Christ, which
              is
              his Church, as I have already proved;
              but they cannot all worship God in the same place, nor hear
              the same Preachers,
              nor live under the inspection
            
            
            
            and discipline of the same Rulers
              and Governours;
              and therefore the Apostles
              instituted
              particular Churches,
              not for the sake of any new Communion or Church-Relation,
              distinct from Catholick
              Communion,
              which is
              Schism, but to comply with the necessity of
              Affairs,
              that all Christians
              may enjoy those opportunities
              of Worship, Instruction and Discipline apart, which they
              cannot enjoy all together,
              and yet continue united
              to all other Christians
              in the same Duties
              and Relations,
              as they have opportunity of discharging
              them.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore if we will argue from
              Principles
              of Reason, the bounds
              of a particular Church must not be
              confined
              to worshipping
              Assemblies,
              but at least extend as far as the exercise of
              Church-Government and Discipline can reach; for as necessity
              requires
              the Constitution of particular Churches,
              so Catholick
              Communion requires
              us not to crumble it into too small
              pieces,
              lest the whole do not well cement and hang together.
              Worshipping
              Assemblies
              are not peculiar to a Church-Relation, but a common duty of
              Christianity; and therefore more
              Christians
              may belong to the same Church, than can worship in the same
            
            
            place, or have a particular knowledge and acquaintance with
              each other.
          </p>
          <p n="4">4. I grant also, That every
            worshipping
            Assembly
            must be attended
            with one or more Church-Officers,
            who have Power and Authority to administer to
            them
            all the parts
            and Offices
            of Christian
            Worship, to pray, and read the Scriptures,
            or preach, and administer Sacraments,
            admonish and reprove Offenders,
            <hi>c.</hi> Nay, I grant it
            is
            very much for the Edification of the Christian Church, that
            such persons
            should reside among them,
            observe their Manners,
            and be Examples
            of holy Living
            to the Flock; but I see no reason, that the Bishop
            himself, who
            alone has
            full Ecclesiastical Power of Censures
            and Discipline, should be the man: But that
            is
            the Subject of our next Dispute.</p>
          <p>
            11. His next Attempt is
              <hi>to prove, That</hi>
            
            <hi>the nature of the primary Episcopacy, (or particular, if
              the word primary be cavilled
              at) is
              such as cannot be done
              in absence, nor</hi> per alios <hi>by
              Substitutes,
              in any of its
              proper parts,
              but only by a present Bishop or Pastor himself.</hi> And
              here he very warily
              like a true Distinguisher observes,
              <hi>That a Bishop may plow
              his Land, or build his House, or saddle his Horse, by
              another, and
            
            
            
            may appoint another to toll the Bell to Church,</hi> c.
              This is
              some favour however,
              that the Bishop is
              not bound
              to be of all Trades,
              a Plowman, Mason, Carpenter,
              Groom, Sexton, <hi>c.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>When he says
            a primary Bishop, he means
            a Parochial Bishop, as he elsewhere
            calls
            him,
            that is,
            every Parish-Minister, who must have all Episcopal Authority;
            and the way he takes
            to prove this is,
            by appropriating
            all the Duties
            of the Ministerial Function wholly
            to the Bishop, that no man else
            has
            liberty, no not by the Bishop's License and Authority, (though
            he qualifies
            this with respect to Preaching,
            making
            him
            only the chief Teacher) to preach the Word, to pray for the
            People, to baptize,
            to celebrate the Lord's Supper, to receive to Communion, to be
            the <hi>chief publick
            Reprover,</hi> (another qualification, because he
            knows
            private Christians
            ought to reprove one another) to be the <hi>chief
            publick
            Excommunicator of the obstinately
            wicked, and absolver of the penitent,
            and to give the blessing
            to the People.</hi>
            If he had
            but added
            chief to all this, we had
            had
            no Dispute with him.</p>
          <p>
            Thus as for private Applications,
              he tells
              you, The Bishop must do all in person;
            
            
            resolve Doubts,
              hear Confessions,
              watch over the Peoples
              Conversation, look to the ordering
              their Families,
              visit the Sick, excite and quicken the dull and backward to
              their duty, take care of the poor, admonish, reprove,
              exhort, ungodly
              persons:
              Here is
              work enough for one man, and I confess his
              Diocess
              ought not to be very large.
          </p>
          <p>
            But how does
              he prove, that the Bishop
              must do all this in person, and not
              imploy
              inferior <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              in most parts
              of this Work, and take care that they do their duty? Why to
              prove this, he
            
            gives
              a description of the Bishop's Work out of the Scripture, and
              whatever duty is
              ascribed
              to any Church-Governours,
              Elders,
              <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              Bishops,
              or what-ever Names
              they go by; all this he appropriates
              to the Office of a Bishop, as that which he must do in
              person. And thus he takes
              the thing for granted,
              which is
              the main Question, whether those
              Elders
              and <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              which we read of in Scripture, were
              Bishops
              or not. But this he takes
              for granted
              upon Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
              Authority; and why may not we reject Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
              Authority, as well as he does
              the whole Assembly
              of Divines,
              and then I doubt he will want Arguments
              to prove it?
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>The Bishop indeed has
            the chief Power and Authority of
            administring
            all holy Offices;
            for a superiour
            Order contains
            all the Power of inferiour
            Orders:
            But there are some things
            which more peculiarly
            belong to him,
            as Ordination, Confirmation,
            and the supream
            Authority of Church-Censures
            in his own Diocess,
            and the inspection of all inferiour
            Ministers,
            and a supervising
            care of all Congregational
            and Parochial Churches;
            that is,
            the Bishop succeeds
            into the Apostolical Power with
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            under him,
            to administer
            all holy Offices
            by his Order and Direction.</p>
          <p>
            But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very learnedly
              proves,
              that a Bishop cannot have any Substitute to do his work for
              him;
              for this Curate or <hi>Substitute, or Agent, or
              Official,</hi> is
              either of <hi>the same Order with the Bishop,</hi> or he
            
            is
              not; <hi>if he be, then he grants
              all, because it
              grants
              him
              all;</hi> that is,
              if you will but allow every Minister to be a
              Bishop, you may
              make Curates,
              or Agents,
              or Officials
              of them,
              or what you please, and he matters
              not; though methinks
              it sounds
              very harsh, that one Bishop should be Curate to another,
              that a Bishop should have no Bishoprick
              of his own, but should supply another Bishop's Cure.
            
            
            Well, but suppose these Curates
              or Substitutes
              be of <hi>an
              inferiour
              Order, either the Bishop giveth
              him
              power and obligation to do the proper work of a Bishop, or
              not; if not, he is
              not hereby enabled
              to do it; if yea, then he hath
              thereby made
              him
              a Bishop; for to be a Bishop is
              nothing else, but to have Authority and Obligation to do the
              work of a Bishop; but if it be an
              accidental, or a common work, which another may do, it
              is
              not that in question, nor do we need the Office of a Bishop
              for it.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            As for <hi>accidental and common
              works,</hi>
              we will except <hi>plowing
              and building Houses,</hi>
              and <hi>tolling
              the Bell to Church,</hi> and such like; and speak only of
              <hi>the proper work of a Bishop,</hi> such as
              Preaching,
              Baptizing,
              and ministring
              the Lord's Supper, and those other Religious
              Offices,
              which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says
              are proper and peculiar to the Bishop:
              And in answer to his Dilemma I assert, 1. That most of those
              Offices
              he has
              named,
              are not so proper and peculiar
              to the Episcopal Authority, but that they may be
              performed
              by others who are no Bishops,
              without making
              them
              Bishops;
              and he has
              not yet proved
              the contrary from Scripture, and I suppose he will not be so
              hardy as to undertake to do it from primitive Antiquity,
              though
            
            
            
            I confess he is
              a valiant and couragious
              man. But 2. suppose that all these
              Offices,
              which <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              are ordinarily
              intrusted
              to perform, did
              primarily
              belong to the Bishop, yet the Bishop's
              giving
              power to <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              to discharge them,
              does
              not make them
              Bishops;
              for as I take it, an
              inherent and a dependent Power and Authority
              does
              make two different Orders
              of men:
              Though there are some different
              Acts
              of Episcopal Authority,
              which were
              never intrusted
              to <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              such as Ordination, Confirmation,
              <hi>c.</hi> yet if there were
              not, this one thing would prove
              them
              different Orders;
              that Bishops
              act by the Authority
              of their Office, <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              by the Authority
              of their Bishop; and it is
              not so much the things
              they do, as the power of doing
              them,
              which makes
              the difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then says
              Mr. <hi>B. Nothing but commissioning
              others is
              the proper work of the</hi>
            
            <hi>Episcopal Order.</hi> But how
              does
              this follow?
              All Religious Offices
              are proper to the Bishop, as performed
              by his Authority,
              without whom
              nothing can regularly
              be done
              in his Church, by any inferiour
              Ministers;
              for I suppose all these acts
              are proper and peculiar to an
              Office, which
            
            
            none has
              Authority to do, but he who is
              invested
              with that Office, or derives
              his Authority from it: But <hi>then any</hi>
              Presbyter
              <hi>may</hi> in foro interno vel externo,
              <hi>ordinarily
              exercise the whole power of the
              Keys
              upon the Flocks;
              he may excommunicate
              and absolve publickly,
              as an
              act common to
              his Flock with the Bishop, if it please the Bishop to give
              him
              power, which he may do without making
              him
              a Bishop.</hi> I grant the Bishop may give
              an
              ordinary Power or Authority to do this, but not
              an
              independent Power, for that is
              peculiar to
              the Episcopal Office; the Bishop must still retain his Power
              of calling
              him
              to an
              account, and rectifying
              any miscarriage
              he is
              guilty of in the discharge of his Office; for this
              is
              the proper Office and duty of a Bishop, which he cannot,
              which he must not part with: The King
              intrusts
              several Officers
              and Ministers
              of State with the discharge and exercise of all the
              parts
              of Kingly Power, but he does
              not give them
              an
              absolute and unaccountable
              Authority, which would be to un-King himself, and make his
              Ministers
              King.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he <hi>enquires,
              Whether God be not the maker of the</hi>
              Presbyters
              <hi>Office? and whether God only
              (describing
              it) give not
            
            
            
            all the power by way of Law, Charter and Institution, and
              the Bishop give it not only by way of Ministerial
              Solemnization and Investiture?</hi> I grant all this, if he
              will but add, that God has
              made
              the Office of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              in dependance
              upon and subordination to their Bishop, and that the Bishop
              does
              and can grant no other Power to
              them;
              and this must be acknowledged,
              if God have instituted
              an
              Order superiour
              to <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              in those very acts
              and duties,
              which are proper to the Office of
              <hi>Presbyters:</hi>
              The thing will be plain, if we put it in a Case, which
              is
              past dispute. The Apostolical Office will be
              acknowledged
              to be superiour
              to those <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              and Elders,
              which were
              ordained
              by the Apostles:
              Wherein then did
              this superiour
              Apostolical Order consist?
              In Authority to preach, to administer
              Sacraments,
              to exercise Discipline, <hi>c.</hi> All this
              belonged
              to the Office of Elders,
              <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              and Bishops,
              (which Names
              were
              used
              promiscuously
              in those days)
              as appears
              from the description of those Offices
              produced
              by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
              Epistles.
              What then was
              peculiar to
              the Apostolical Office, which <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              might not do? Why, excepting
              Ordination and Confirmation, or
            
            
            giving
              the holy Ghost, there was
              nothing peculiar to them,
              but that supream
              Power by which they acted;
              whereby they could correct what
              was
              amiss, and govern all other Ministers
              of Religion in the exercise
              of their Office, and appropriate what
              parts
              of it they pleased
              to themselves, when they were
              present. But now if Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              had
              been
              present, when St. <hi>John</hi>
              threatned
              <hi>Diotrephes</hi> for assuming
              an
              uncontroulable
              Power to himself, and refusing
              to entertain those whom
              he had
              sent;
              if he had
              deposed
              him
              from his Office, or limited
              the exercise of it, he might thus have
              disputed
              the case with the Apostle, as he
              proceeds
              to argue, <hi>Whether he, who is
              duely
              called
              to the Pastoral
              Office, which God only made
              and described,
              must not (in season) do all the
              Works
              of that Office, whether men
              commission
              him
              or not?</hi> But I suppose St. <hi>John</hi> would have
              had
              an
              Answer ready for him;
              that men
              who receive an
              Office from God independent on any
              superiour
              Office, must do their duty, without
              expecting
              any new Commission and Authority;
              but if God have instituted
              their Office in dependance
              on a superiour
              Office, they
              must act in dependance
              and subordination too, and must expect the
            
            
            
            Directions
              and Authority of their Superiours.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for what he adds,
              <hi>or whether at least he any more need the Bishop's
              Commission for Church-Government,
              Excommunication
              and Absolution, than for preaching
              and celebrating
              the Lord's Supper, seeing
              both are now confess'd Acts,
              common to the Order
              of the</hi> Presbyter <hi>and the Bishop?</hi> I answer,
              There is
              much more reason for the Bishop to keep the exercise of
              Discipline
              in his own hands,
              than Preaching
              and administring
              the Sacraments,
              because he can better exercise Discipline over a numerous
              Flock, than preach in person, and administer the
              Sacraments
              to all in his Diocess;
              and Church-Censures
              is
              a matter of that consequence, and liable to so many
              miscarriages,
              and requires
              so much prudence, that all <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              who are able to preach very piously,
              and to administer the Sacraments
              with all due gravity and devotion, are not fit to be
              intrusted
              with it: However a <hi>Presbyter</hi>
              depends
              upon his Bishop, as to the exercise
              of his Ministry in Preaching
              and administring
              Sacraments,
              as well as in all other Ministerial
              Acts;
              and therefore there is
              no difference upon this account, but that the Bishop
              ordinarily
              grants
            
            
            Authority for one, but not for the other.
          </p>
          <p><hi>But is
            all giving
            of Power to another proper to the Bishop's Order?</hi> No, he
            cannot make a Constable; but what if it be? <hi>Then the
            Minister cannot give his Clerk power to choose the Psalm or
            Tune.</hi> This, I confess, is
            a material difficulty, which I did
            not think of before, and must take some more time to consider
            it; and if it proves
            unanswerable, I will hereafter
            choose and set the Psalm my self, if my Clerk will let me; for
            I think Clerks
            pretend to the Bishop's License too in these
            Cases.</p>
          <p>
            <hi>But may not a Bishop, if he please, also give power to
              the</hi> Presbyters
              <hi>to ordain, and to give other
              men
              power?</hi> I know not to what purpose this
              serves;
              for if he did
              so, there would be a great deal more to be
              said
              for the Ordinations
              made
              by <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              by their Bishop's Authority, than when they ordain in a
              Schism, and in opposition
              to their Bishops:
              But I have two things
              to say to this: 1. That the Bishop can
              impower
              men
              only to such Acts
              and Offices,
              as concern his own Diocess,
              which is
              his peculiar Sphere for the exercise of this kind of Power;
              for he cannot give any <hi>Presbyter</hi> a License to
              preach or administer
            
            
            
            the Sacraments
              in another Diocess;
              but Ordination respects
              the whole Catholick
              Church; and therefore the exercise of it must be
              regulated
              by the Laws
              of it, which have not formerly
              allowed
              <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              to ordain, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself
              reserving
              Ordination as the peculiar
              Act of Episcopal Power; though <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              were
              allowed
              to lay on hands
              together with the Bishop.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. That which makes
            me suspect, whether
            the Bishop can grant this Power of
            Ordinations
            to meer
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            is,
            because they
            having
            no plenary Power and Authority in themselves, but only in
            dependence on
            their Bishop, their Office qualifies
            them
            to receive Directions
            and Power, but not to give it: Though how far the consent of
            the Bishop may go in this Case, I cannot tell, and don't see,
            how the present Controversie
            is
            concerned
            in it.</p>
          <p>
            But <hi>is
              not Church-Discipline the exercise</hi>
            
            <hi>of the power of the Keys?
              If then the power of the Keys
              may be exercised
              by the</hi> Presbyters,
              <hi>when-ever the Bishops
              please, it seems
              it is
              common to them
              with him,
              as well as Sacraments,
              and therefore belongeth
              not to him
              as Bishop, but as a</hi> Presbyter. I answer, The power of
              the Keys
              may
            
            
            be exercised
              by both, but the Authority is
              only inherent in the Bishop; <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              are only qualified
              by their Office to exercise this Authority with the Bishop's
              consent, but have it not in themselves, as separate from
              their Bishop; and therefore
              a Bishop as a Bishop, not as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
              has
              the power of the Keys,
              as that signifies
              the actual exercise of it. The difference between a Bishop
              and <hi>Prssbyter,</hi>
              with respect to those Acts
              which may be done
              by both, is
              this, that a Bishop has
              actual Authority to do it, a <hi>Presbyter</hi>
              has
              only a fitness, capacity, or qualification,
              to do it with his Bishop's consent and leave, as it must be,
              where there is
              a superiour
              and inferiour
              Order and Power,
              with respect to the same Acts
              and Offices.
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often says,
              that he dares
              not disown Apostolical Officers,
              whom
              he calls
              Bishops
              of Bishops,
              to be set over Parochial Bishops;
              and these are only those very Officers,
              whom
              we call Diocesan
              Bishops;
              and if he will allow such superiour
              Bishops
              with Apostolical Power,
              his Parish-Bishops
              can be no other than our Subject-<hi>Presbyters;</hi>
              for Apostolical
              power over Ministers,
              is
              a superiour
              power, in the exercise of all parts
              of their Office, to direct and govern, to correct
            
            
            
            and restrain, to bound
              and limit the exercise
              of their power, as he sees
              fit for the common good and edification of the Church; for
              to be superiour
              to them
              in the same Acts,
              must signifie
              a power to direct, restrain, and govern
              Inferiours,
              in the proper Acts
              of their Office and Function.
          </p>
          <p>But <hi>if the commanding
            another to do an
            Office-work, be all that is
            proper to the Bishop, I ask (says
            Mr.</hi> B.) <hi>whether any thing there be proper to
            him?
            and so whether we
            must have such an
            Office? for may not the King command the Minister to do all
            the Work which belongeth
            to his Function?
            may he not appoint Magistrates,
            and make Laws
            to command it?</hi> c. But
            whoever
            said,
            that the Episcopal power is
            only to command
            another to do an
            Office-work? for a Bishop may forbid the
            exercise of that
            Office, the exercise of which he can
            enjoyn
            and command; but Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            did
            not care to mention this, for fear if he
            took
            away this suspending
            and silencing
            power from the Bishop, he must give it to the King, and he
            does
            not like this power in any ones
            hand but his own.</p>
          <p>
            But cannot this eternal Distinguisher find some little
              distinction here? Is
              the
            
            
            Bishop's License and Authority nothing but a compulsory
              Command? A <hi>Presbyter</hi>
              has
              Authority indeed to preach and administer
              Sacraments,
              but it is
              in dependence
              upon the Bishop; and if a King commands
              a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to do his Office, he must command
              him
              to obey his Bishop, and exercise his Ministry in
              subordination
              to him;
              and I can easily
              guess, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will pay the same obedience in this
              case to the Command of his King, as he
              does
              to his Bishop.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says,
              that <hi>Grotius</hi> (to whom
              we do pay a very just respect, as he
              deserves)
              <hi>truely
              says,
              that that saying,</hi>
            
            <hi>that what a man doth by another, he
              seemeth
              to do by himself, belongeth
              only to those actions,
              whose nearest
              efficient cause is
              not defined
              by the Law,</hi> (that is,
              which he is
              not by Law bound
              to do in his own person, but may do by a Proxy;) <hi>but
              sure when God made
              the Pastoral Office, he meant,
              that the Pastors
              called
              to it, should do the work, and not only appoint other
              men
              to do it.</hi> Most sure; and thus a Bishop ought to do the
              work of a Bishop,
              and a subject <hi>Presbyter</hi> of a subject
              <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and those who do not must answer for it,
              such as those <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              are, who refuse subjection and obedience to
            
            
            
            their Bishops
              in all lawful things.
              But if by this he means,
              that every Bishop must preach to his whole
              Diocess,
              and know every person in it, and take a particular account
              and inspection over them,
              I say, this is
              not the work of a Bishop, and I have a good reason for it,
              because the Apostles
              ordained
              <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              as assistants
              to the Bishop in this work, and therefore are his
              authorized
              Proxies,
              as far as he is
              pleased
              to imploy
              them;
              and there would be no need of this Office, if a
              Bishop must do
              all himself.
          </p>
          <p>But he adds,
            <hi>And I would know, whether
            the work of a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>(as to
            consecrate and
            celebrate the Sacraments)
            may be done</hi>
            per alium, <hi>by one that is
            no</hi> Presbyter;
            <hi>if not, (as all say not) then I ask, Whether the Bishop's
            work or the</hi> Presbyter'<hi>s be most sacred? If the</hi>
            Presbyter'<hi>s, then his Office
            is
            more sacred; if the Bishop's, (or both alike) then that
            Bishop's work may no more be done</hi>
            per alium <hi>than the</hi> Presbyter'<hi>s.</hi>
            This is
            most admirable Reasoning!
            but I will get off as well as I can.</p>
          <p n="1">
            1. Then who taught
              him
              to distinguish the <hi>Presbyter</hi>'s from the Bishop's
              work? when the <hi>Presbyter</hi>
              has
              no work but what is
              more eminently
              the Bishop's, and what he does
              by his Authority and Consent,
            
            
            which undermines
              the very foundation
              of his Argument.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. Nor is
            it a very good Consequence, that because God by Apostolical
            Institution,
            has
            made
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            subject to Bishops,
            to minister in holy things
            by their Consent and Order, that therefore
            subject
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            must have an
            inferiour
            degree of subject
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            under them,
            to do their work: There is
            no such Order appointed,
            and that is
            a sufficient Argument
            that there is
            no need of it; for if there be too few
            <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            to do the work, the Bishop has
            Authority to ordain
            more, and such Proxies,
            Vicars,
            or Substitutes,
            must not be subordinate to one another without end, and
            therefore must stop, where the reason
            ceases.</p>
          <p>As for what he urges
            to the same purpose,
            about the exercise of Discipline and
            Church-Censures,
            for confining
            a Church to a single Congregation, where the Bishop
            is
            constantly
            present, all these pretences
            have been
            already so shamefully
            baffled
            by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> in his
            Letters
            to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> lately
            published,
            that no man need concern himself farther in that Cause.</p>
          <p>
            Thus I have shewn,
              that <hi>local, personal, presential Communion,</hi>
              is
              not essential to the notion of a Church; that a
              particular
            
            
            
            Church needs
              not be confined
              to the narrow bounds
              of a single Congregation; and therefore I proceed now to
              explain what that Christian Communion
              is,
              which is
              essential to the Constitution of a
              particular
              Diocesan Church, which I shall briefly
              do in three Particulars.
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. That all who live within the
            Precincts
            of such a Church, meet together with their
            neighbour-Christians,
            at publick
            and solemn times
            and places
            for Religious
            Worship: This will be readily
            granted
            by all, that publick
            Worship is
            an
            essential Church-duty, wherein the Communion of
            Christians
            with each other consists;
            to be sure our Adversaries
            will not deny this, who make it
            essential to
            the notion of a particular Church, that all the
            members
            of it meet together in the same place.</p>
          <p>
            And that we ordinarily
              communicate in all the Offices
              of Religion with our neighbour-Christians,
              is
              necessary to Christian Communion, at least that it be within
              the Communion of the same Church: Common Christianity
              makes
              us members
              of the Catholick
              Church; and this obliges
              us to Christian Communion,
              and the place of our Habitation
              determines
              our Communion to that particular
            
            
            Church where we dwell; for Catholick
              Communion requires
              us to communicate
              with any true Church where we are; and
              designedly
              to avoid the Communion
              of any Church, where we can communicate without sin,
              is
              a breach of Catholick
              Unity and Communion; for he who
              refuses
              the Communion of any one true Catholick
              Church, does
              not live in Catholick
              Communion, and therefore is
              a Schismatick.
          </p>
          <p>And this I take to be the true Reason, why the
            Apostles
            planted
            but one Church in a City and its
            Territories,
            though it were
            never so large, that neighbour-Christians
            might all live in the same Communion,
            under the same Discipline and Government, that there might be
            no Schisms
            and Emulations
            occasioned
            by distinct
            Communions,
            which we have too much reason to believe might have
            happened,
            when we consider, how apt they were
            to break out into Sidings
            and Factions
            in the same Church.</p>
          <p>
            Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> indeed upon the
              Authority
            
            of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi>
              seems
              to assert, that there were
              in the Apostles
              days
              two Bishops,
              at least in some Cities,
              and two distinct Communions
              of <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles;
              that</hi> Peter <hi>at</hi> Rome
              <hi>was
            
            
            
            Bishop of the</hi> Jews,
              <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>of the</hi>
              Gentiles.
              Now though in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, it
              was
              a fixed
              Rule, that there should be but one Bishop in a Church; upon
              which account among others he rejects
              the Ordination
              of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> because
              <hi>Cornelius</hi>
              was
              elected
              Bishop by much the Majority of Bishops,
              <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              and People, and
              actually
              ordained
              and possess'd of his Chair, before the clandestine
              Ordination
              of <hi>Novatianus;</hi> and it seems
              it was
              then a standing
              Rule, that after there is
              a Bishop canonically
              elected
              and ordained,
              there could not be a second: but
              sometimes
              it happened,
              that two Bishops
              were
              ordained
              either by different Factions
              and Parties,
              or when the Church was
              divided
              by Schisms,
              as in the time of the <hi>Donatists</hi>
              and <hi>Arians;</hi>
              and to compose such Differences,
              it has
              in some Cases
              been
              agreed
              by Councils,
              that they should both exercise Episcopal Power, and live in
              the same Communion, which is
              the Case Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions
              at <hi>Antioch</hi> between <hi>Flavianus</hi> and
              <hi>Evagrius;</hi> in some Churches
              when the Bishop grew
              ancient, he ordained
              his Successor while he himself lived,
              who governed
              the Church with a joynt
              Authority; and though they had
              two Bishops,
              they had
            
            
            but one Church, which was
              St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Case, who
              was
              made
              Bishop in his Predecessor's
              time. And this is
              the reason of that observation <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
              makes
              of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              has
              observed,
            
            that they never had
              two Bishops
              as other Churches
              had,
              which he assigns
              as the cause of that Dispute which
              was
              among them,
              about choosing
              <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop; for their Bishop
              was
              dead without
              any surviving
              Bishop to succeed him,
              it not being
              the custom of that City, as it was
              in some others, to have a new Bishop
              chose,
              before the old one was
              dead.
          </p>
          <p>But yet that there were
            two Churches
            at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
            days,
            one of <hi>Jews,</hi>
            another of <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
            who had
            their distinct and separate Communions,
            I must see very well proved,
            who ever says
            it, before I will believe it; much less will I believe, that
            St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
            the Bishop of one of these separate
            Churches,
            for so indeed two
            distinct Communions
            to divide
            <hi>Jews</hi>
            and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
            is
            no better than a Separation.</p>
          <p>
            This is
              that very thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              did
              so earnestly
              endeavour to prevent in his Epistles
              to several Churches,
              where there was
              any danger of it: For this he
            
            
            
            reproved
              St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who by his
            
            complyance
              had
              like to have occasioned
              a Schism between <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
              For this purpose (as the Dean observed
              in his Sermon, which occasioned
              all this Dispute)
              he writes his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
              and warns
              the Christians
              at <hi>Rome</hi> of such factious
              Zealots,
              who would break Communion with the
              <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              unless they would be circumcised
              and keep the Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            This, as the Dean truely
              observed,
              was
              the Apostle's great design in his
              Epistle to the
              <hi>Philippians,</hi>
              to preserve one Communion among
              them,
              both <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              between whom
              the Dispute and Difference was;
              and therefore chose
              these words,
              <hi>Nevertheless, whereto we have</hi>
            
            <hi>already attained,
              let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same
              thing,</hi> as a proper
              Text against Separation. Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
              disputes
              very warmly
              about the meaning
              of the Apostle in these words,
              and will by no means
              allow, that the Apostle here had
              any reference to their observing
              the same Rules
              of Worship, and living
              in the same Communion, which was
              all the D. designed
              to prove from them.
              It would be too tedious, and not much to my
              present Design,
              to examine particularly
            
            
            what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has
              objected,
              and the Dean answered,
              and the Dr. again replyed
              in this cause; and therefore I shall only
              briefly
              prove; that the design
              of the Apostle in this place is
              to perswade
              them
              to one Communion, to Worship God together, and not to
              divide into
              Separate Assemblies
              of <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            They are both agreed,
              that the rule the Apostle here gives
              concerns
              the differences
              between the believing
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts
              about observing
              the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi>
              Only Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would
            
            have the Apostle in the beginning
              of the Chapter, when he warns
              them
              against
              <hi>dogs,</hi>
              and <hi>evil workers,</hi>
              and the <hi>Concision,</hi> to mean the
              unbelieving
              Jews,
              who persecuted
              the Christian Name and Church, such as he
              says
              he describes
              in the Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians.
              For ye</hi>
            
            <hi>brethren became
              followers
              of the Churches
              of God, which in Judaea are in Christ
              Jesus: for ye
              also have suffered
              the like things
              of your Country-men,
              even as they have of the Jews,
              who both killed
              the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets,
              and have persecuted
              us, and they please not God, and are contrary to all
              men,
              forbidding
              us to speak to the Gentiles,
              that they might be saved;</hi>
            
            
            
            but I confess it seems
              difficult to me, whom
              the Apostle means
              in these words.
              The latter clause of their Character,
              <hi>forbidding
              us to speak to the</hi> Gentiles,
              seems
              to infer, that they were
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              who pretended
              to believe in Christ, but would not allow the
              Apostles
              to Preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              at least not to receive them
              into the Church without
              Circumcision, and obedience to the Law, for
              unbelieving
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              were
              not particularly
              concerned
              about their Preaching
              to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              but opposed
              their Preaching
              Christ at all. But then that other part of the Character,
              that they killed
              the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> and their own
              Prophets,
              and Persecuted
              the Christian Churches
              in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Apostles;
              seems
              to point out the unbelieving
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> applies
              them;
              but there is
              no necessity of that, since it is
              sufficiently
              known,
              that these hot bigotted
              Zealots
              for their Law, did
              joyn
              even with unbelieving
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              in Persecuting
              the <hi>Jewish</hi> Christians,
              who Communicated
              with <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts,
              as Apostates
              from their Law, and therefore
              though they pretended
              to believe in Christ, yet the Apostle
              reckons
              them
              still among Infidels
              or Apostates;
              and
            
            
            St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly
              tells
              us, that he was
              Persecuted
              by these men
              for Vindicating
              the liberty of the <hi>Gentile</hi>
              Christians.
              <hi>And I Brethren, if I yet Preach
              Circumcision,
              why do I yet suffer Persecution?</hi>
            
            <hi>then is
              the offence of the Cross ceased.</hi>
              Which supposes
              that he was
              Persecuted
              for not Preaching
              Circumcision.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore I doubt not but by
              <hi>Dogs,</hi>
              and <hi>Evil-doers,</hi>
              and <hi>the Concision</hi>
              the Apostle means,
              as the D. observed
              those Zealots
              for the Law, who endeavoured
              to rend and divide the Church, and Separate
              believing
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              from each other; those very men,
              whom
              in the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
              he wishes
              were
              cut off. <hi>I would they were
              even cut off which trouble</hi>
            
            <hi>you,</hi> for these were
              the men
              they were
              more in danger of than the profest
              Enemies
              to Christianity, whose work it was
              to Persecute the name of Christ, not to sow
              Dissentions
              and make parties
              among Christians,
              and who could not so easily
              deceive the believing
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              while they themselves continued
              Infidels.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were
              indeed, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> observes
              another sort of Jews,
              <hi>who acquiescing</hi>
            
            <hi>in the Liberty of the Gentiles,
              declared
            
            
            
            by the Apostles</hi>
              Acts
              15. <hi>yet judged
              themselves, and all other circumcised
              Jews,
              obliged
              to the observation of the Law, and
              its
              Institutions.</hi>
              How far they acquiesced
              in this determination I cannot tell; I
              am
              sure there were
              very hot Disputes
              among them,
              and upon this account St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              gives
              that Rule of mutual forbearance <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and the
              Dr. tells
              us, <hi>yea it is
              judged</hi>
            
            <hi>that according
              to their different apprehensions
              of these things,
              there were
              two Churches
              at</hi> Rome, <hi>one of the Circumcision,
              the other of the Gentiles,
              walking
              in a distinct Communion each by
              themselves.</hi>
              This I absolutely
              deny, and this he dares
              not assert, much less attempt to prove; but he
              sayes,
              <hi>however there was
              a different rule of this kind between
              the Churches
              of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Antioch---<hi>yet
              was
              there no Schism between these Churches,
              but a constant Communion in Faith and Love;</hi> and he
              ought to have added
              in Religious Worship, as any of the
              Members
              met
              together, for without this there
              is
              no Christian Communion, <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              as the Apostle tells
              us being
              now made
              one body in Christ, that is
              one Church, and one Communion.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            Against the dividing
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              who would have made
              two Churches
              of the <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              the Apostle cautions
              the <hi>Philippians</hi>
              in this Chapter: he tells
              them
              the perfection of Christianity
              consists
              <hi>in forgetting
              those things
              which are behind,</hi> that is
              the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, and <hi>reaching
              forth unto those things
              which are before,</hi> that is
              the Gospel of Christ, in obedience to which alone, we can
              obtain the price of our calling,
              <hi>let us therefore as many as are
              perfect be thus
              minded,</hi>
              that is,
              not trouble our
              selves
              about legal observances,
              which are of no value, but govern our
              Lives
              by the Laws
              of the Gospel, <hi>and if in any thing you be otherwise
              minded,</hi>
              that is,
              if any of you still think, that you are
              bound
              to obey the Law of <hi>Moses,
              God shall reveal even this unto you:</hi> wait
              patiently
              till you be better instructed
              without breaking
              the Peace and Communion of the Church. And then
              follows
              that Rule, about which the dispute
              has
              been;
              <hi>Nevertheless whereto we have already
              attained,
              let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same
              thing.</hi> Now this the Dr. does
              very well, and very agreeable to the scope of the place
              refer to one Communion;
            
            
            
            but there is
              a very great dispute
              what the rule is
              of Christian Communion, by which we must walk, and a great
              deal of wit, and a great many Criticisms
              have been
              bestowed
              on it: the Dr. plainly
              proved,
              that it was
              but one rule, whereby men
              of different
              attainments
              must walk, that this rule did
              not concern meerly
              different opinions,
              but the direction of our Practice,
              and that this rule had
              an
              influence
              upon our pre_ent
              case; thus he concluded
              from the _cope
              and design of the place, and argues
              truly;
              and there is
              one plain Observation, which has
              not been
              expresly
              taken
              notice of, which I think will confirm all this and put it
              out of dispute. And that is
              this, that 
              signifies
              those things
              wherein they were
              all agreed
              <hi>whereto we have attained</hi>
              being
              opposed
              to those different apprehensions,
              which they had
              about the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
              some having
              a more perfect knowledge of Christianity,
              which delivered
              them
              from observing
              the Law, others <hi>being
              otherwise minded,</hi>
              and still retaining
              a greater
              veneration of the Law, which kept
              them
              in bondage under it; but sayes
              the Apostle setting
              aside these different apprehensions
            
            
            of things,
              <hi>whereto we</hi> (all) <hi>have
              attained,
              let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same
              thing.</hi> Now what was
              that wherein both <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              agreed?
              That is
              easily
              answered,
              it was
              the belief of the Christian Religion, the Faith and Worship
              of Christ; this they both equally
              believed,
              this was
              that, whereunto all had
              attained,
              and therefore in these matters
              sayes
              he, whatever our different attainments
              and apprehensions
              may be in other things,
              <hi>let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same
              thing.</hi> That is,
              let us maintain the Communion of the Church in the Faith and
              Worship of Christ, and not separate from each other, as if
              we did
              not believe in, and worship the same God and Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            For we may observe, that the controversies
              about the Law did
              not concern the
              Christian Worship, such as Circumcision and the
              differences
              of Meats
              and Drinks,
              which related
              more to private Conversation, than
              publick
              Worship, and therefore in these
              matters
              the Apostle gives
              the rule of mutual
              forbearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. commands
              them
              <hi>to receive those who are weak in the Faith,</hi> that
              is,
              to all parts
              of Christian
            
            
            
            Communion, as it respects
              publick
              Worship or private Conversation; but not to enter into
              doubtful disputes
              about other matters;
              and that offence and scandal he
              warns
              them
              to avoid, seems
              to refer principally
              to that great temptation
              of breaking
              Church-Communion,
              which the Apostle by all means,
              so industriously
              endeavoured
              to prevent, and therefore tells
              them,
              <hi>that the Kingdom
              of God,</hi> or the Christian Church, Religion and Worship
              <hi>is
              not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in
              the Holy Ghost, for he that in these
              things
              serveth
              Christ, is
              acceptable to God and approved
              of men:</hi>
              and therefore
              these disputes
              about the Law having
              no influence upon Christian Communion
              and Worship, they ought not to separate upon this score, nor
              by an
              uncharitable use of their liberty to tempt others to
              separate.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that the Apostles
              Precept here is,
              that Christian <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              should all unite upon the common
              Principles
              of Christian Faith and Worship, and in these
              matters
              observe one and the same rule, Worship Christ in the same
              manner, and
              with united
              minds
              and hearts,
              and this is
              a plain justification of all
            
            
            the Dean concluded
              from these words,
              that Christians
              must live in the same Communion, and observe the same rule
              of Worship, whatever their different
              attainments
              might be in other matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this is
              not a general rule in all cases,
              that whereto we have attained
              we must walk by the same rule; that we must unite only in
              those things
              wherein we agree, which will not end any dispute in the
              Church, nor cure any one Schism; for if we consider, how
              many different opinions
              there are in matters
              of Worship at this day among us, which are so far distant,
              that there is
              not any part of Worship, if we consider
              the modes
              and circumstances
              of it, wherein all agree, how can we apply this rule to cure
              our divisions,
              it being
              impossible for all parties
              to agree in any one standing
              rule of Worship; but the Apostles
              rule is,
              that they should lay aside the disputes
              about the <hi>Jewish</hi> law, and agree upon the
              received
              rules
              of Christian Faith and Worship, that they should not divide
              into distinct and separate
              Communions,
              but observe the same rule, and Worship God with one heart
              and mind, and this Explication
            
            
            
            suggests
              several things,
              which evidently
              shew,
              how applicable these words
              were
              to the Dean's design in opposing
              Separation.
              As,
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. That the rule of Christian forbearance
              concerns
              only such different opinions
              and practices,
              as might consist
              with the peace and unity of the Church, and the Communion of
              Christians
              in the same acts
              of Worship; such as the disputes
              about meats
              and drinks,
              and other legal observances
              were;
              but St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought any mistake
              tolerable,
              which made
              Christians
              separate from each other; the reason of that rule of
              Christian forbearance, was
              not to perswade
              the differing
              parties
              of Christians
              not to cut one anothers throats,
              but not to divide the Church, and separate into opposite
              Communions:
              and therefore he who treats
              the believing
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              with too much gentleness,
              who allowed
              the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              their Christian liberty, though they
              themselves
              observed
              the law, expresses
              the greatest
              indignation and zeal against those
              <hi>Jews,</hi>
              who would not receive the uncircumcised though
              believing
              <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              into the Church, but perswaded
              the Christian <hi>Jews</hi>
              to separate from
            
            
            them,
              calls
              them
              <hi>Dogs</hi>
              and <hi>Evil workers</hi>
              and <hi>the Concision,</hi> which
              is
              nothing else but Dividers
              and Separatists,
              and <hi>wishes
              that they were
              even cut off;</hi> and therefore
              Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and others, who would
              apply this to
              forbearing
              all Christians
              of different apprehensions,
              who divide and separate into opposite
              Churches
              and Communions,
              do greatly
              mistake the Apostles
              design, who never dreamt
              of such a forbearance as this, but
              commands
              them
              to exercise mutual forbearance
              in order to their receiving
              one another, that is,
              living
              in the same Church-Communion and Fellowship with each other,
              not to their living
              peaceably
              in Separate Churches.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. That those Christians
              who live together
              in the same Church, must observe
              the same rule of Worship; but sayes
              Dr. <hi>O.</hi> what is
              this rule? <hi>if it reach our case, it must be such as
              requires</hi>
            
            <hi>things
              to be observed,
              as were
              never Divinely
              appointed,
              as National Churches,
              Ceremonies,
              and modes
              of Worship.</hi> Now the plain answer
              is
              this, that let the rule of Worship be what it will, it must
              be but one in the same Church; they must all observe the
              same rule, which is
              necessary to
              Communion and Uniformity
            
            
            
            of Worship; they must not set up
              distinct and
              separate Churches
              with opposite
              rules
              of Worship, for this is
              destructive
              of Christian Communion. 2. No doubt but the Apostle
              refers
              to that rule of Christian Worship, which
              was
              then practised
              among them,
              which they then knew
              very well, and which we all know
              was
              agreeable to the general rules
              of the Gospel, though it might vary in several
              Churches
              in some modes
              and circumstances;
              and this is
              to be our rule still as the D. well
              answered,
              to conform our Worship to the nature of Christian Religion,
              and the general rules
              of the Gospel, which is
              all that can be required
              of us, when there is
              no perfect standing
              platform of Worship
              in all the parts
              and circumstances
              of it prescribed
              in Scripture, <hi>to observe those
              things
              which although they be not particularly
              commanded
              by God, yet are enjoyned
              by lawful Authority, provided
              that they be not unlawful in themselves, nor repugnant to
              the word of God:</hi> and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> may deny this
              still if he pleases,
              which is
              the only answer he gives
              to it; but will never be able to disprove it.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. Another thing I observe in the
              words
              is,
              that at least we must not
            
            
            break the Peace and Communion of the Church, upon account of
              any differences,
              which do not immediately
              influence our
              Worship. Notwithstanding their disputes
              about meats
              and drinks
              between <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              the Christian
              Worship was
              the same, and therefore
              herein they must unite, and forbear
              each other in other matters:
              and if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have
              observed
              this rule, how many Objections
              against Conformity,
              or Lay Communion, would it have
              prevented
              and answered,
              with which he has
              now troubled
              the World; Indeed according
              to this rule, no difference
              should be sufficient for Separation,
              but what does
              immediately
              concern the
              nature and Administration of Religious Worship; if the
              Worship be lawful and true Christian Worship, we must
              observe the same rule, <hi>whatever other
              differences
              there may be between us.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            That I may not be thought to wrong Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this,
              I shall give some plain instances
              of it, and leave other men
              to judge, how well he has
              observed
              the Apostolical rule, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              charges
              the
            
            Dean with, saying
              <hi>that there is
              no other reasons
              of Separation because of the Terms
              of our Communion, than what was
              from
            
            
            
            the beginning
              of the Reformation.</hi> Though these are not the
              Deans
              words,
              who sayes,
              <hi>that although the present reasons
              for Separation would bave held
              from the beginning
              of the Reformation, yet no such thing
              was
              then practised,
              or allowed
              by those, who were
              then most zealous for Reformation:</hi>
              wherein Mr. <hi>B.</hi> endeavours
              to conceal the force and design of the D's Argument from the
              judgment
              and practice of former Dissenters,
              whose names
              they still glory in, to shew
              the unexcusableness of the present
              Separation,
              even upon the Principles
              of old Non-conformity.
          </p>
          <p>But let us take it as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            proposes
            it, and see what other reasons
            there are for Separation now, than the
            Non-conformists
            had
            in former times.
            And they are in number Five.</p>
          <p n="1">
            1. <hi>As to the things
              imposed
              now which were
              not them.</hi>
              And here he reckons.
              1. <hi>The Vestry Act. 2. The Act of
              Uniformity.
              3. The Corporation Act, all referring
              to renouncing
              the Covenant and Obligation of it for themselves and
              others,</hi> which is
              his 4. Now these indeed were
              not in being
              before, because the Covenant
              was
              not. But what is
              this to the Terms
              of Communion? cannot men
            
            
            joyn
              in all the lawful and enjoyned
              Acts
              of Worship, unless they be Vestry-men,
              or Ministers,
              or Schoolmasters,
              or Aldermen,
              Sheriffs,
              and Common-Councilmen?
              If they scruple renouncing
              an
              illegal and
              sinful Covenant, cannot they worship God without
              renouncing
              it? unless they
              think their Covenant obliges
              them
              not to comply with such Church-Administrations,
              as to endeavour the extirpation
              of them,
              when they can.
          </p>
          <p n="5">5. <hi>Re-ordination was
            not required
            in former times,</hi>
            and I know not how it should, when there
            were
            none to be reordained?
            But may not they worship as Lay-men,
            (as some think they are no better)
            if they cannot act as publick
            Ministers?
            And what are the People concerned
            in this Dispute, who are neither
            required
            to be ordained
            nor re-ordained?
            And how does
            this justifie
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and many others, who have no need of
            Reordination?</p>
          <p>

              are saved:</hi>
              Nor 9. <hi>the word Pastor, as applied

              unlawful on any pretence whatsoever to resist any

              things

              but all the enquiry is
              now, how any of these things,
              though never so truely
              alledged,
              can justifie
              Separation,
              when not any one of them
              is
              made
              a necessary term of Lay-Communion.
              Was
              not the Dispute between the <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              about the obligation of the Law of
              <hi>Moses,</hi>
              much more considerable
              than any of these, and yet because they
              did
              not influence the terms
              of Communion,
              the Apostle commands
              that they should be laid
              aside, and that they should joyn
              together in the same Rule of Christian
              Worship?

          <p n="2">
            2. Another difference he makes
              <hi>in the drift and tendency of these
              Impositions:</hi>
              The plain meaning
              of which is
              to charge our Governours
              with ill Designs,
              when they command no ill thing; which
              is
              a very loyal, peaceable and Christian
              temper: but if
              other men
              command good
            
            
            things
              with an
              ill De_ign,
              why cannot they obey them
              with a good one?
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. <hi>Another difference is
              in the Effects.</hi>
              As 1. <hi>then</hi> (in former times)
              <hi>open Preaching
              and gathering
              Assemblies
              by non-Conformists,
              would have greatly
              offended
              the Prince; but our King by his Declaration at</hi> Breda,
              <hi>and his three first Declarations,
              and by his Licenses
              and Connivence,
              shewed
              such wisdom and clemency, as intimated
              less displeasure at our liberty:</hi> And well they have
              rewarded
              him
              for it! But are not his Acts
              of Parliament of as great Authority as his
              Declarations?
              Is
              the peace and unity of the Church no duty, but as it
              pleases
              or displeases
              the King? Was
              the Design of his Majesties
              Clemency to harden them
              in Faction and Schism? Did
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> consider, what an
              untoward Argument that was
              to convince the King of the necessity of
              executing
              Laws,
              to convince them
              of the necessity of obeying?
              2. Separation in former times
              <hi>would have deprived
              most of the non-Conformists
              of their hopes
              of publick
              liberty in the Parish-Churches,
              which most of them
              enjoyed;
              but we had
              neither possession nor expectation
              of such a thing.</hi> 1. I answer, What
              does
              this concern the Peoples
              Conformity?
              2. What does
              it concern the non-Conforming
            
            
            
            Ministers
              Lay-Communion? 3. Does
              hope or despair of greater
              liberty, make
              the terms
              of Communion more or less sinful in themselves? This
              is
              an
              admirable Casuist, and we learn from
              him
              the size and rule of a non-Conforming
              Conscience: This is
              foul play, to justifie
              themselves, by bringing
              a reproach upon the ancient <hi>Puritans,</hi>
              many of whom,
              I hope, were
              honester
              men.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. In former times
              Separation <hi>would have hindred
              and hazarded
              the progress of the Reformation; but our
              Preaching
              hath
              done
              more to stop the progress of the
              Syncretism,
              or of Popery.</hi> Pray what new Reformation
              was
              needful after the Reformation
              of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King
              <hi>Charles</hi> the I? None that I know of, but the
              Reformation of 43. and the following
              years
              of Reformation, when they reformed
              <hi>Episcopacy</hi> into <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
              and <hi>Presbytery</hi> into <hi>Independency,</hi> and a
              sober <hi>Liturgie</hi>
              into a <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and 39
              <hi>Articles</hi>
              into all the wild Freaks
              of <hi>Familism, Anabaptism, Quakerism,</hi> and as many
              monstrous Opinions
              as were
              unknown in former Ages,
              and could scarce be paralleled
              in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> or <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And if this
              were
              the reason, why
              they did
              not separate, that they
            
            
            might accomplish this blessed
              Reformation,
              we heartily
              thank Mr. <hi>B.</hi> both for his Discovery and for his
              Separation; for we desire to see no more such
              Reformations
              as these: though what their Preaching
              does
              to keep out Popery, I cannot tell; I
              am
              sure their Separation helps
              to bring it in.
          </p>
          <p n="4">4. Another Reason why they
            did
            not separate formerly,
            and do now, is
            this, because <hi>few of the most ignorant that
            needed
            them,
            would then have left their Parish-Churches
            to hear non-Conformists
            in private,</hi> (this was
            no great Argument of their Ignorance, but that they
            were
            good understanding
            Christians,
            who knew
            their duty in preserving
            Unity and Order in
            Church-Communion) <hi>but now many will come to us that cannot
            get into Parish-Churches:</hi>
            If he would have shewn
            the difference between these two
            Causes,
            he should have added
            the <hi>Ignorant</hi>
            in the latter part too, which whether
            it be true or no, let him
            who knows
            his Hearers
            best, judge. But the sum is
            this, they may conform, when they
            cannot get
            Hearers
            in schismatical Conventicles,
            but Conformity is
            a very ill thing, when they can.</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. Another difference is
              <hi>from the aggravation
            
            
            
            of Conformity, as in the Church that we must communicate
              with:</hi> As 1. <hi>That the Pastors
              and Vestries
              of our conforming
              Churches
              are a company of perjured
              Villains,</hi>
              viz. for renouncing
              the obligation of an
            
            impious Covenant. But is
              the Dispute about the obligation of the Covenant of
              greater
              moment, than about the obligation
              of the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi>
              and yet the Apostle would not allow that a just cause of
              Separation. 2. That there is
              no longer
              any hope of Reformation, since so many bad
              men
              are allowed
              in our Communion;
              but were
              there not bad men
              in former Ages?
              and were
              not the <hi>Novatians</hi>
              and <hi>Donatists</hi>
              to be blamed,
              who separated
              upon this account? and do not the old
              non-Conformists
              expresly
              reject this, as
              a sufficient Reason for Separation?
          </p>
          <p n="3">3. The <hi>Canon now excommunicates,</hi>
            ipso facto, <hi>all who profess themselves
            non-Conformists:</hi>
            but pray what new excommunicating
            Canons
            have been
            made
            since the King's Return? or is
            the excommunicating
            non-Conformists
            a sufficient Reason to justifie
            non-Conformity?</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. 2000 <hi>Ministers
              were
              not before cast out, which now tempts
              the People to forsake our Communion:</hi> but great
              numbers
              were
            
            
            before silenced,
              as they used
              to complain of old; and the Dispute
              is
              not what tempts
              People to be froward, but what will
              justifie
              a Separation: though, I fear, it
              was
              not the casting
              out 2000 Ministers,
              if that was
              the number, but the 2000 that were
              cast out, who drew
              our People to
              Separation.
          </p>
          <p n="5">
            5. Formerly,
              <hi>when one Bishop cast any out, some other
              usually
              would endure them;
              but now it was
              not so:</hi> This is
              the great grievance, that there are no Puritanical
              Bishops
              in these days,
              to foster such non-Conformists,
              who when time serves,
              would be for plucking
              up root and branch again. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should
              consider, what has
              made
              this Alteration: Those Confusions
              these men
              brought
              upon Church and Nation, have convinc'd
              Bishops,
              that it is
              a dangerous thing to cherish such
              Persons,
              whose whole design is
              to poyson
              People with Fanatical Principles,
              and to undermine the present Constitution. Some
              Bishops
              saw
              the tendency of their Principles
              before they outed
              them;
              others were
              taught
              by dear-bought
              Experience;
              and can they blame the Bishops,
              that they do not take those for such innocent and
              well-meaning
              men,
              who pluckt
              off their own vizards,
              and
            
            
            
            discover a real Enemy, under the
              flattering
              disguise of a meek and humble, but scrupulous and
              tender-conscienc'd Friend.
          </p>
          <p n="6">6. Some who do not communicate, nor separate, are
            tolerated
            among us; and therefore they had
            reason to hope, that if they did
            separate, they should be tolerated,
            which is
            the substance of his Argument, too long to transcribe; and a
            wise one it is:
            but our Laws
            or Canons
            tolerate such men;
            but Discipline is
            not duely
            executed
            upon the careless or prophane,
            and therefore they may separate, as well as not communicate
            all; and I confess they may; but the neglect of Discipline and
            Government does
            neither excuse the sin of those who absent
            themselves
            from our Communion, nor of those who separate: but if this be
            a new Case, which was
            in the time of the old non-Conformists,
            we may see what the blessed
            effects
            of a Fanatick
            Reformation has
            been.</p>
          <p n="5">
            5. His last difference between the Case of former and
              present non-Conformists,
              is
              taken
              <hi>from the things
              which give them
              fuller cause for their Preaching
              and Assemblies,</hi>
              i. e. that they have more reason now to preach in separate
              Meetings,
              than
            
            
            there was
              before. He names
              some; as 1. <hi>We saw
              the Kingdom, though under Usurpers,</hi>
              (it is
              well he will own those to be Usurpers
              now, whom
              he did
              not think so in 59.) <hi>engaged
              by vow, practice, and about 16 years
              possession and custom, to another way; and who could expect,
              that a Law should presently
              change them
              all, and assure them
              of Absolution.</hi> But 1. methinks
              they might have tryed
              whether it would or no; but this they
              durst
              not trust to, but took
              all possible courses
              by Libels
              and Pamphlets,
              in their private Talk, and Sermons,
              to keep up the old humour, and alienate the
              minds
              of People from
              the established
              Religion, and then plead that necessity, which
              themselves
              have made.
              2. I hope they will not plead 16
              years
              possession, when no Religion was
              established,
              as a sufficient prescription against that, which
              has
              been
              the Religion of this Nation ever since the Reformation. 3.
              Is
              Communion with our Church ever the worse, because a potent.
              Faction and Schism had
              thrust it out 16 years?
              4. Might it not have been
              as reasonably
              expected,
              that People would have returned
              to the Communion
            
            
            
            of the Church, as to their Allegiance to their Prince,
              though <hi>they had
              been
              engaged
              by vow, practice, and about 16 years
              possession and custom, to another way?</hi> 5.
              Did
              this Vow and Covenant oblige them
              against Conformity to our Communion,
              that they needed
              somewhat besides
              a Law to assure them
              of Absolution?
              6. Either the People did
              well in adhering
              to their old Vows
              and Covenants,
              or they did
              not: If they did,
              it is
              not possession and custom, but the merit of the Cause, which
              is
              their justification; if not, how could such conscientious
              men
              uphold and countenance People in a bad way, because they
              had
              been
              so long in it? Those who had
              helpt
              to bring them
              into these
              ways
              of Schism, I should have thought,
              had
              been
              more obliged
              to have helpt
              them
              out again: but it is
              no sign of a very tender conscience, to keep
              People in such
              dangerous mistakes,
              rather than own a mistake themselves.
              Whoever act
              upon such Principles,
              value their Credit and Reputation above the
              Salvation of
              their own or other mens Souls.

            3. Another difference is
              fetcht
              from
            
            
            Plague and Fire, which made
              the Government
              take less notice of them,
              and gave
              them
              opportunity to poyson
              the minds
              of discontented
              People. This is
              the old Fanatick
              way of expounding
              Providences;
              they think that lawful to do, which Providence
              gives
              them
              an
              opportunity
              of doing:
              As for the King's License,
              this indeed may excuse them
              from the sin of Rebellion and Disobedience, in
              setting
              up Conventicles,
              not from the evil of Church-divisions
              and Separation; but this is
              a meer
              pretence, for they kept
              Conventicles
              without the King's License both before and since.
          </p>
          <p n="4">4. Another difference was
            those Invitations
            they had
            from the People to preach; but every body
            knows,
            that they did
            not stay for the Peoples
            Invitation,
            but first invited
            them
            to hear. But however methinks
            this is
            but a sorry justification
            of Separation, that they complyed
            with the schismatical Inclinations
            of People, whom
            they ought to have taught
            better.</p>
          <p>
            Thus you see, how this Rule of the Apostle may be
              applied
              to our present Controversie,
              not to break the Peace
            
            
            
            and Communion of the Church, for the sake of any different
              apprehensions
              of things,
              which do not immediately
              concern
              Religious Worship.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to return to the Argument which
              occasioned
              this Digression: Since St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              was
              so zealous an
              Enemy to Separation, and made
              it so much his business to preserve
              the <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              in the same Communion, let who will believe, that he set up
              such a distinct and separate Communion
              of <hi>Gentiles</hi>
              at <hi>Rome,</hi> or that <hi>Peter</hi>
              did
              of <hi>Jews,</hi>
              for my part I cannot. When St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              wrote
              his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
              there was
              but one Church there, consisting
              of <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              whom
              he perswades
              to forbear, and to receive one another; nor
              is
              there any evidence from Antiquity to make it appear that
              there were
              two Churches
              there; the only thing that has
              inclined
              some learned
              men
              to favour that Notion, is
              that difficulty there is
              in Antiquity, how to order the Successions
              of the first Bishops
              in the Church of <hi>Rome; Linus, Clemens,
              Cletus,
              Anacletus,</hi> at least if these two last be not the same
              man, as seems
              very probable.
              But this was
              the worst way they
            
            
            could have taken,
              when it is
              so plain, that there was
              nothing St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all
              Churches
              did
              more earnestly
              endeavour to prevent; an_
              I had
              rather these Successions
              should remain a difficulty till
              Dooms-day,
              than to cut this knot by dividing
              the Church.
          </p>
          <p>The result of this whole Discourse
            is,
            That to the Communion of a particular Church, it
            is
            necessary, that neighbour-Christians
            meet together for all the Acts
            of Religious Worship, and that nothing can
            justifie
            a Separation from the Church wherein we live, but sinful
            terms
            of Communion;
            for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> discourses
            of occasional Communion, and purer
            Communions,
            and such kind of Christians
            as are members
            of the Catholick
            Church, but are not members
            of any particular
            Church, has
            been
            considered
            already.</p>
          <p n="2">
            II. Another thing essential
            
            to the Communion of a particular Diocesan Church,
              is
              to live in Communion
              with the Bishop
            
            
            
            of that Church; for the Unity and Communion of a Church
              consists
              in the Union be__een
              Pastor and People, as I think every one
              acknowledges,
              who owns
              such a thing as an
              organical Church. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              defines
              <hi>a Church to be a People united
              to their Bishop, and a Flock keeping
              close to their Pastor.</hi> But I need not
              industriously
              prove that, which no body denies,
              the only Dispute here being
              between the
              Diocesan and Parochial Bishop,
              (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls
              him)
              which of them
              is
              the proper Pastor of the Flock; but this I have already
              discours'd at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor is
              there any difficulty in explaining,
              what it is
              to live in Communion with our Bishop, which
              signifies,
              to worship God
              in the Communion of that Church whereof he
              is
              Bishop, to obey his Rules
              and Orders,
              to reverence his Counsels
              and Censures,
              and in all things,
              which concern the Matters
              of Religion and Christian Worship, to be subject to his
              Authority and Directions,
              while he enjoyns
              nothing contrary to the Rules
              of
            
            
            Scripture, or inconsistent with any part of our duty to God
              and man.

          <p n="3">
            III. Another thing wherein Church-Communion
              consists,
              and which is
              an
              essential part of our Communion with our Bishop,
              is
              to live in the Communion only of those
              <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              who live in the Communion of their Bishop, that
              is,
              who officiate by his Authority, and are
              subject to his
              Directions
              and Orders.
              This was
              a standing
              Rule in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, as
              is
              evident from his Epistles,
              That <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              must do nothing in the Church, but by the Bishop's Consent
              or Order, and those who do, are
              Schismaticks,
              and those People who adhere to them
              in it, partake in the guilt of their
              Schisms;
              such was
              <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> and those other
              <hi>Presbyters</hi>
              of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who broke
              Communion
              with St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> their Bishop,
              whom
              therefore he did
              excommunicate, and forbad
              his People to communicate with them,
              under the pain of Excommunication,
              if they did,
              and describes
              their Schism
            
            to be <hi>a dividing
              and sharing
              the People with the Bishop,
            
            
            
            that is,
              separating
              the Sheep from their Pastor, and
              Children
              from their Parent.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And this gives
              a plain Answer to that Question Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so often
              asks
              us, why we cannot communicate with
              them,
              as well as they with us; the Resolution of which
              is
              very easie,
              because they do not communicate with their Bishop, and
              therefore are Schismaticks;
              they preach without his Authority, and contrary to it, which
              is
              to set up Altar against Altar;
              and though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sometimes
              communicates
              with our Parish-Churches,
              that does
              not excuse him
              from the guilt of Schism, because he
              preaches
              without and in opposition to the Authority of his Bishop,
              and draws
              People away from the Communion of the
              Parish-Churches,
              which alone are in Communion with their Bishop. Nor can I
              excuse those Amphibious Christians
              from Schism, who sometimes
              go to Church, and sometimes
              to a Conventicle; for though they are not in a constant
              state of Schism, as not having
              wholly
              forsaken
              the Communion of their Bishop, yet every time they go
            
            
            to a Conventicle, they are guilty of a schismatical Act; and
              had
              we a St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              among us at this day, they would not be
              suffered
              to shift turns
              thus between a
              Church and a Conventicle; for he
              expresly
              declared,
              that those who communicated
              with <hi>Felicissimus</hi> or <hi>Augendus,</hi>
              his schismatical <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
              should not be suffered
              to communicate in the Church with
              him.
          </p>
          <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks,
            it is
            not the License and Authority of the Bishop, but the Consent
            of the People, that makes
            a Church-relation between Pastor and
            People; and then
            if they can but perswade
            the People to choose them
            for their Pastors,
            the work is
            done;
            the one may preach and administer
            Sacraments,
            and exercise Discipline, and the other
            communicate
            in all Religious Offices
            without Schism; that neither Bishops
            or <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            are any thing to the People, unless they choose
            them,
            or consent to a Church-relation with
            them,
            and that all those who are advanced
            into such Ecclesiastical
            Offices
            without the Consent of the People, are no better than
            Intruders
            or Usurpers.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>This Controversie
            about the Power of the People in the choice of their
            Pastors,
            I confess, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
            managed
            with more Learning,
            and a fairere appearance of Reason, than any thing else; but
            yet has
            not set things
            in a true light, nor given
            Objections
            their proper and natural place, which
            confounds
            mens minds,
            and hinders
            them
            either from understanding
            or judging
            aright what he says.
            And therefore in Answer to him,
            I shall reduce
            what I have to say under these three
            Heads:
            1. I will at present suppose the Right of the People to choose
            their own Pastor, and consider whether it will
            justifie
            our present Separation. 2. Examine
            what inherent Right they have in the choice of their
            Pastors.
            3. In what cases
            they ought to insist upon this Right.</p>
          <p n="1">
            1. Let us suppose at present the Right of the People to
              choose their own Pastors.
              I would only ask, Whether they are not
              bound
              to choose their Pastors
              in the Communion of the Church?
              Whether they
              are not still bound
              to obey the orders
              and constitutions
              of the Church, wherein they live,
              supposing
              them
              to be
            
            
            just and lawful? Whether under a
              pretence of
              choosing
              their own Pastors,
              they may separate from the Church, and set up distinct
              Churches
              and Communions
              of their own? If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not allow this, then
              notwithstanding the Peoples
              right of choice and consent, they cannot choose Schismatical
              Presbyters
              for their Pastors
              without being
              guilty of Schism; and therefore all this dispute about the
              power of the people is
              nothing at all to our present controversie
              of Separation.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet among all those numerous
              Citations
              of Authorities
              out of Ancient Councils,
              and Fathers,
              and Ecclesiastical
              Historians,
              he cannot produce one Testimomy to give the People right to
              justifie
              a Schism by the choice of their
              Pastors,
              or to give them
              power to consent
              to a Church-relation with Schismatical
              Bishops
              and Presbyters.
              St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              whom
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so often cites
              for saying,
              that people have the greatest
              power to choose good Pastors
              and to refuse the evil, yet condemns
              those people, who adhered
              to <hi>Novatianus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
              threatens
              to Excommunicate those at
            
            
            
            <hi>Carthage,</hi> who communicated
              with <hi>Feli_issimus</hi>
              and those other Schismatical Presbyters,
              who joyned
              with him:
              did
              he now think, that these people
              had
              right to choose, where and whom
              they would to enter into a Church-relation with
              them:
              if he did,
              he did
              very ill to forbid them,
              and to threaten
              Excommunication
              against them;
              if he did
              not, how would he answer Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Argument, that
              every man is
              nearest
              to himself, and most concerned
              in the eternal happiness of his Soul, and therefore ought to
              judge for himself, who to entrust the care of his Soul with.
          </p>
          <p>And yet this has
            been
            the case of all Church-divisions
            and Schisms;
            whoever began
            them,
            they have been
            continued
            and encreased
            by the consent of the people
            to take such Schismaticks
            for their Pastors,
            and yet I never remember, that this consent to a
            Church-Relation between the <hi>Novation, Arrian,
            Donatist,</hi> Bishops
            and People, was
            ever thought a justification
            either of their Schism or of their
            Heresie;
            if it were,
            there never could be any such thing as Schism.</p>
          
          
          <p>And therefore whatever right may be in the people to choose
            their Pastors,
            it cannot excuse them
            from Schism to break the Communion of the Church wherein they
            live, and to choose their Pastors
            out of the Church; to joyn
            in Communion with those Presbyters,
            who Separate from the Communion of their Bishop, and set up
            distinct Churches
            in opposition to him.</p>
          <p>
            But it will be said,
              that this is
              to grant and to deny in the same breath; to allow People a
              right of consent in the choice of their
              Pastors,
              and yet not to admit of any choice, but where it can't be
              had:
              for they cannot choose their own
              Pastors
              in the Communion of the Church of
              <hi>England;</hi>
              for excepting
              some few Parochial Churches,
              who have the right of Patronage
              in themselves, all the Bishops
              and Parish Ministers
              of <hi>England</hi> are chose
              by the King, or by Private Patrons;
              and they do not think themselves
              concerned
              to communicate with that Church, which
              has
              none or very few Pastors
              rightly
              chose,
              and therefore their Separation is
              no Schism, but a forming
              themselves into a Church-Society, which they
              had
              not before;
            
            
            
            and I hope now, they will not complain,
              that I have not fairly
              stated
              their case: and I shall endeavour to give as plain
              an
              answer to it, and not offer any thing to others, but what
              satisfies
              my self.
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. And First I would desire
            them
            plainly
            to answer me one question, whether
            there be any such thing, as a Christian Church in
            <hi>England</hi> Establisht
            by Law, if they answer, there is
            not, that is,
            if they are so hardy as to unchurch us, when they give their
            reasons,
            I will endeavour to answer
            them,
            but I never met
            any of them
            yet, that would own such a Principle, nor give the least
            intimations
            of it in the most free and familiar converse, where they
            were
            in no danger of Laws
            or Inquisition;
            the general complaints
            are against the terms
            of our Communion, and there we are willing to
            joyn
            issue with them;
            if then we be a Church notwithstanding this irregular
            promotion of Bishops
            and Presbyters,
            then to separate from us without just reason
            is
            a sin, and the irregular choice of
            Bishops
            and Presbyters
            is
            no just cause, because we are acknowledged
            to be a true Church notwithstanding this.</p>
          <p n="2">
            
            
            2. If they are not willing to grant this, that we may be a
              true Church, and fit to be communicated
              with, though the people
              do not choose their own Bishops
              and Parish Ministers,
              it is
              easie
              to extort this confession from them,
              or to put them
              to the blush. For I would ask them,
              suppose all
              these impositions
              they complain of were
              removed,
              (I mean those which concern the
              terms
              of Communion, such as the Liturgy and
              Ceremonies)
              whether it were
              lawful to joyn
              in Church-Society with our Parish-Churches,
              though the King and Private Patrons
              would not give up their right of
              Presentations;
              if they say it were,
              then it is
              plain, that the want of Peoples
              consent in the choice of their Pastors
              does
              not unchurch us, nor justifie
              a Separation, and therefore this
              is
              a meer
              pretence not a true reason of their
              separation:
              If they say, that the consent of the People
              is
              essentially
              necessary to the constitution of a Church. Then 1. they
              unchurch most if not all the Protestant
              Churches
              of <hi>Europe,</hi> who have no such choice. 2. They
              unchurch their dear selves
              in all the late glorious times,
              for Patrons
              would not consent to that piece of
              Reformation
            
            
            
            to give the disposal of their Livings
              to the choice of the Parishioners,
              though sometimes,
              as they do still, they might gratifie
              some principal Inhabitants
              with a nomination of a fit Person: And 3. If this be their
              judgment
              they would do well to declare it, for unless the
              Parliament-men
              will grant away their Advowsons
              of Livings
              to the several Parishes,
              we can have no thorough Reformation to heal our
              Divisions,
              but this will be an
              eternal pretence for Separations,
              and then the constitution may as well
              remain as it
              is,
              as be altered
              to no purpose.

            3. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> owns
              that an
              after-consent
            
            of people to their Bishop or Parish-Ministers
              is
              sufficient to found a Church-relation:
              and this after-consent is
              sufficiently
              manifested
              by <hi>constant Communion;</hi> let us then by this
              principle examine whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> be
              a Church or not.

          <p>
            If we look back then to the Reign of Queen
              <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> it
              is
              certain it was
              a Church in those dayes,
              for whatever antecedent consent they
              had,
              the generality of the Nation gave
            
            
            an
              after consent to their Bishops
              and Ministers,
              the great body of the people even the
              Puritans
              themselves for the most part living
              in Communion with them;
              thus it continued
              for the greatest
              part of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Reign, Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> himself asserting,
              that there were
              very few Non-conformists
              at the beginning
              of the War: The Bishops
              then and Parish Presbyters
              of those dayes,
              were
              the just and rightful Pastors
              of the Church, not only by a legal
              Title, but by the consent of the
              People, who
              joyned
              in Communion with them;
              and therefore those who separated
              from them,
              and deposed
              them,
              must be Schismaticks;
              and those who succeeded
              in their rooms
              Usurpers;
              unless they shew
              some other reason for their Separation than want of the
              Peoples
              consent to a Church-relation, or it be in the power of the
              people, when they please, to choose new
              Pastors,
              and depose their old ones,
              and overturn Church and State, and set up any thing or

            When the King returned,
              the great body of the People returned
              to the Communion
              of the Church, and had
              continued
              there to this day, had
              not some busie
              Factors
              for Separation drawn
              them
              into a
            
            
            
            Snare, and by degrees
              formed
              them
              into a distinct Party and Interest from the
              present
              Establishment; and yet notwithstanding
              the numerous Sects
              and Parties,
              Divisions
              and Sub-divisions
              of Fanaticism, I doubt not but much the
              greatest
              part of the Nation is
              still firm to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and live in
              Communion with it; which proves
              us in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own way to be a Church, and
              consequently
              those who separate to choose their own
              Pastors
              to be guilty of Schism.
          </p>
          <p n="4">
            4. I have one Inquiry more, whether those
              Presbyters
              who were
              ordained
              in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not
              Schismaticks,
              if they separate from the Church without just reason; and
              whether those who communicate with
              Schismaticks
              and choose such for their Pastors,
              are not Schismaticks:
              So that it is
              not enough to justifie
              their Separation, to assert the
              Peoples
              power in choosing
              their own Pastors,
              but they must vindicate their own Innocence, not only as to
              Nonconformity, but Separation;
              for if they are Schismaticks
              in separating
              from that Church, of which they are
              Presbyters,
              the People must be Schismaticks
              in choosing
              them
              for their Pastors;
              now they cannot deny the Church
            
            
            of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church, for then they must
              renounce their own Ordination,
              and therefore the only way they have to vindicate themselves
              from the guilt of Schism, is
              by proving
              our Church to be so corrupt, that they cannot without sin
              communicate with it: and thus the
              controversie
              returns
              to its
              old bottom, the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the
              terms
              of our Communion, where we desire to keep it, and from
              whence Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
              with all imaginable arts
              endeavoured
              to remove it.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. Let us now consider what right the People have of consent
              to the choice of their Pastors;
              and here I shall speak with as much care as I can, for fear
              of falling
              under Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s lash for want of <hi>Logical
              strictness,</hi> as the D. does,
              for whom
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can
            
            think of no better Defence than <hi>that he
              is
              none of the Disputers
              of this World, who deceive men
              with vain Philosophy;</hi>
              and I doubt not but the D. will be very well
              contented
              to leave that Character to himself, and let
              him
              make the best of it: and that all this out-cry about the D's
              Logick
              and Philosophy,
              is
              for using
              <hi>power</hi> instead of
            
            
            
            <hi>right and liberty,</hi> and yet I
              am
              so stupidly
              Illogical, that I think <hi>the power of
              consenting</hi>
              to be the same thing with <hi>the right of
              consenting;</hi>
              but <hi>power of consenting
              in the People, and power in Rulers
              are not univocal but equivocal terms:</hi>
              What then: It is
              power still, and may properly
              be called
              power in the People, as well as in the
              Rulers,
              though the power be not the same. <hi>But the word (Choice)
              instead of (Consent) is
              somewhat more crooked,</hi>
              which <hi>(crooked)</hi>
              I suppose is
              a new Logical term: but what is
              the matter? may not that consent, which alone
              makes
              the choice obligatory to the People, be very
              properly
              called
              the choice of the People? No, <hi>for (choice)
              ordinarily
              includeth
              the first nominating
              vote.</hi> In what Logick?
              a choice is
              a choice, whoever nominates
              the persons
              to be chosen,
              especially
              if the people may reject every
              one that is
              nominated,
              till one is
              nominated
              in whom
              they agree and consent: I know not what <hi>Logical
              strictness</hi>
              this is,
              but I am
              sure, it savours
              of a rude and petulant humour, and
              an
              odd kind of composition of Spite, Pride and Pedantry: But
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may spare
            
            
            his pains,
              the World knows
              the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> too well, to think that he
              need be taught
              Logick.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to avoid the rebukes
              of this angry man as well as I can, I will
              carefully
              consider what he means
              by that right of consent the people have in the choice of
              their Pastors.
              And he fully
              explains
              his sence
              in Five particulars.
              1. That the <hi>People are no judges
              who is
              fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ.</hi> And
              therefore Bishops
              and Presbyters
              may be Ordained
              without the consent of the people; and
              therefore may
              be true Ministers
              of Christ, whether the people consent to it or not, which I
              desire may be remembred
              till a convenient time. 2. <hi>The
              Supream
              Civil Governour
              is
              the Judge, whom
              he must countenance maintain and tolerate;</hi> which
              is
              another very useful observation.
              3. <hi>The disposal of the Tythes
              and Temples
              is
              in the power of the Prince and Patron by his grant:</hi>
              This is
              a very comfortable observation too, for poor Church of
              <hi>England</hi> men,
              who are Persecuted
              for being
              Loyal to their Prince. And yet upon second
              thoughts,
              he is
              unwilling to give up all interest to the
            
            
            
            Tythes
              and Temples.
              And therefore has
              several qualifications
              and limitations
              of this power to bring it all back again: For 1. <hi>The
              Princes
              Power is
              not absolute</hi> (over Tythes
              and Temples)
              <hi>but under Christ:</hi> That we grant, for we don't make
              a God of our King---3. <hi>If the
              Tythes
              and Temples
              were
              given
              for the Pastors
              of the Churches,
              the Magistrate
              is
              bound
              to give them
              to such as are lawfully
              called
              to be such Pastors,</hi>
              i. e. To those who are chose
              or consented
              to by the People, for he looks
              upon none others as lawfully
              called,
              and therefore adds,
              <hi>and not by the advantage
              of his trust overthrow the way of entrance
              instituted
              by Christ:</hi> And by having
              the power of the Tithes
              and Temples
              in his hand, he must not deprive the People of their right
              of consent, by giving
              the Tythes
              and Temples
              to those have not their consent,
              or refusing
              to give them
              to those who have: And 4. threatens
              them
              with Sacriledge,
              if they do not: For <hi>if they</hi>
            
            <hi>were
              devoted
              to God, God is
              the Proprietor,
              and it is
              Sacriledge
              to alienate them,
              and an
              intolerable ill disposal is
              alienation.</hi>
              Here he was
              loth
              to speak out,
            
            
            and therefore will not charge them
              in express words
              with Sacrilege for disposing
              of them
              without the Peoples
              consent, but
              only <hi>an
              intolerable ill disposal is
              alienation;</hi> but what he means
              any man may guess by what goes
              before: and speaking
              of the same business a little
              after; sayes
              the D. <hi>confesseth
              I deny not the Magistrates
              or Patrons
              power of their own gift (the case of Sacrilege I leave to
              their Consciences.)</hi>
              So that if
            
            they will venture to be Sacrilegious, they may give the
              Tythes
              and Temples
              without the Peoples
              consent. Is
              not this now a man of Logick,
              who has
              wound themselves into the possession of
              Tythes
              and Temples
              too at the back door of the Peoples
              consent? For they cannot be disposed
              of, but to such Persons
              as have the Peoples
              consent, unless Prince and Patrons
              will be content to be damned
              for a Sacrilegious promotion
              of Church-men;
              which is
              an
              admirable
              power he grants
              to Princes
              and Patrons.
              And thus his former grant to the Civil Magistrate to judge
              <hi>whom
              he must countenance, maintain and tolerate,</hi>
              is
              quite vanished
              too; for it is
              plain he must maintain only those
              whom
              the
            
            
            
            People consent to receive as Pastors,
              for they must have the Tythes
              and Temples,
              unless he will commit Sacrilege, and I think this
              is
              to <hi>countenance,</hi> and somewhat more than to tolerate
              them:
              thus the <hi>right and liberty</hi> of the people, which he
              will not allow to be called
              <hi>Power,</hi> to <hi>consent</hi> to the choice, not to
              choose their Pastors,
              overtops
              all the power of Princes,
              disposes
              of Tythes
              and Temples,
              and gives
              Laws
              to the Magistrate whom
              to maintain and tolerate,
              and whom
              not. And yet this he will not allow to be
              <hi>Pleading
              the Peoples
              cause against Magistrates,
              Patrons
              and Laws.</hi>
              And yet I confess I am
              glad to hear that Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              has
              any sense of Sacrilege, and I hope the godly party will
              consider it, and never think of
              fingering
              Churchlands
              again. The 4. §. is
              much to the same purpose: but 5. he
              tells
              us, <hi>I have oft said,
              that mutual consent is
              necessary to the being
              of the relation of Pastor and Flock. And though
              sometimes
              the Rulers
              imposition, and the Patrons
              choice, may make it the Peoples
              duty in prudence to consent, when the good
              preponderates
              the</hi>
            
            <hi>hurt (not else) yet till they consent the
              relation
              is
              not existent.</hi>
          </p>
          
          
          <p>Now before I consider his proofs
            for the necessity of this consent, it
            is
            worth while to consider, how these
            things
            hang together, and what an
            admirable division
            here is
            of Ecclesiastical power between
            the Prince, the Clergy, and the People. As for the Prince we
            have already
            seen
            how all his power is
            gone;
            the people have a Negative Vote against his choice, and if he
            will not comply with them,
            they can choose for themselves without his consent, and he
            has
            no Negative vote
            against them,
            not so much as to the disposal of
            Tythes
            and Temples
            without the danger of Sacrilege.</p>
          <p>
            The case between the Clergy and the People
              is
              somewhat more disputable, for Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              owns
              that <hi>the People are not Judges,
              who is
              fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ: But the
              Ordainers
              and the Person himself conjunct, (i. e.</hi> the person to
              be Ordained,
              are the judges
              of it) <hi>which</hi> (he sayes)
              <hi>is
              evident from Scripture instances
              of all that were
              ordained.
              2. From the nature of the thing:</hi> For <hi>who
              is
              supposed
              so fit to judge as men
              and Seniors
              of the same Office? Who but Physicians
              are fit to judg,
              who is
              meet to be a licensed
              Physician?
            
            
            
            And who but Philosophers
              judge of Graduates
              and Professors
              in Philosophy?</hi> And thus he
              has
              in good time given
              up his Cause, as will appear by some few plain
              Questions:
              For,
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. Has
              a Minister of Christ Authority to preach the Gospel, and to
              instruct and govern the Church of Christ? If he
              has
              not, what does
              his Ordination signifie?
              When he has
              received
              Authority from Christ, must he wait for the
              Consent of the
              People? Does
              not the Authority
              of Christ command the subjection and consent of the People?
              For (1.) dare any Christian refuse to be
              instructed
              and governed
              by any Minister, who has
              received
              Authority from Christ? Does
              not Christ tell his Apostles,
              and in them
              all the successive Pastors
              of the Church, <hi>He that refuseth
              you, refuseth
              me, and he that refuseth
              me, refuseth
              him
              that sent
              me?</hi> And what Christian dares
              refuse Christ in his Ministers
              and Servants,
              when they come to them?
              Will it be owned
              for a good excuse at the day of
              Judgment
              for refusing
              any Minister, who is
              set over us in Christ's Name and by his Authority, that we
              had
              not given
              our Consent to a Pastoral Relation to
            
            
            him?
              It is
              very true what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says,
              That <hi>it is
              impossible,</hi> ex natur rei, (from the nature of
              the thing) <hi>that the Pastoral
              Office should be exercised
              upon Dissenters;
              therefore their Consent is
              necessary. A Patient may be drencht
              like a Horse,</hi>
            
            <hi>and crammed
              like fatted
              Fowl, and so may have a Physician against his will, but a
              soul cannot use Pastoral Helps
              unwillingly.</hi>
              But the Question is,
              Whether these men
              are not bound,
              as they love their souls,
              and will answer the Affront they put upon the Authority of
              Christ in his Ministers,
              willingly
              and chearfully
              to submit to Pastoral Conduct and
              Government,
              <hi>to obey those who are set over
              them
              in the Lord;</hi> whether the obligation
              of conscience and sense of duty ought not to cure a
              capricious humour? For it is
              too late to dispute the Authority
              of a publick
              Minister of Religion, when he has
              received
              Authority from Christ, which he may exercise over any part
              of the Christian Church, where either
              the Invitations
              of the People, or the Power of the Magistrate shall place
              him.
              And I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to
              shew
              me any one instance in Scripture, where the Consent of the
              People was
              required
              in setting
              over them
              any Bishop or <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
            
            
            
            who was
              already ordained.
              Something
              is
              alledged
              for their Consent at Ordinations,
              as their presence at the choice of
              an
              Apostle to succeed in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the
              choice of Deacons,
              though not much to the purpose, and as we must conclude from
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nothing at all to the purpose, <hi>that
              there is
              no Scripture-instance (of the Peoples
              being
              Judge, who is
              fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ) in all that
              were
              ordained.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>And thus it was
            in the Ages
            succeeding
            the Apostles,
            the great care and interest of People
            was
            at Ordinations;
            for when once they were
            ordained,
            there was
            no resisting
            their Authority, unless they were
            canonically
            deposed.</p>
          <p>This is
            evident in the Ordination of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
            and Readers,
            to whose Ordination
            the Consent of the People was
            usually
            asked;
            though sometimes
            it was
            done
            without, as we find in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who
            ordained
            some while he was
            under Banishment, absent from his Church, and
            gives
            an
            account to them
            by Letter, what he had
            done.
            But when they were
            ordained,
            they were
            imployed
            by the Bishop for the administration of
            Religious
            Offices,
            without asking
            any further leave
            of the People.</p>
          
          
          <p>Thus we know that Bishops
            were
            never
            ordained
            but to some Church, and the Canons
            expresly
            provide against the translation of
            Bishops
            from one Church to another, and it
            was
            but very rarely
            practised
            in ancient times;
            and therefore
            when the Episcopal Chair was
            empty by the death
            of the Bishop, the great contest
            was
            to choose a Bishop to be ordained
            to that vacant Church. This Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will find to be
            true in most of those Examples
            and Canons
            which he himself has
            produced.</p>
          <p>
            There is
              one Canon indeed he quotes,
            
            which the D. had
              quoted
              before, of the Council of <hi>Antioch;</hi> which
              supposes,
              that when the Bishop is
              ordained
              for any Church without the Consent of the
              People, they
              did
              sometimes
              refuse him;
              the words
              as Mr. B. translates
              them
              are these: That if one be ordained
              Bishop, and go not to the Parish, (but for all his
              translating
              it <hi>Parish,</hi> the Council
              does
              not speak of Mr. B's. <hi>Parochial Bishop)
              because the
              People refuse him,
              he shall have</hi>
            
            <hi>the Honour and Office of a Bishop, not
              troubling
              the peace of the Church; which</hi> (as Mr. B.
              adds)
              <hi>plainly
              saith,
              what I have oft said,
              that the People have no power to hinder any from
              being
              Ministers
            
            
            
            or Bishops
              indefinitely
              in the universal Church, but only to judge whether he shall
              be theirs, whereas the Ordainers
              had
              power in both Cases.</hi>
              But where does
              this Canon say any such thing? It
              seems
              to me, as the D. said,
              to suppose the quite contrary,
              that the Bishops
              who were
              the Ordainers,
              did
              not believe that the People had
              any inherent Right any more to choose their own Bishop, than
              to ordain; for
              they did
              ordain the refused
              Bishop <hi>indefinitely
              in the universal Church,</hi> but
              ordained
              him
              to that particular Church, where the People
              refused
              him;
              which necessarily
              supposes,
              that they did
              think they had
              Authority to do so, (what-ever Custom
              sometimes
              prevailed
              against it) without asking
              the Peoples
              Consent, or else they would never have
              attempted
              it; and therefore that provision
              they make for him
              to retain the Honour
              and Office of a Bishop, though his People should refuse
              him,
              does
              not suppose
              that of Right they might do so, but
              was
              a prudent provision to prevent for the future such
              Disorders
              and Troubles
              in the Church, as probably
              had
              happened
              formerly
              upon such occasions.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>I doubt not but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well
            saw
            the truth of what I have now discoursed,
            but was
            very unwilling to make the peoples
            consent necessary to the ordination of a Bishop, but
            only to found a
            pastoral relation, for he was
            sensible, that people could have no further interest in
            ordinations,
            than to be judges
            of his holy and blameless conversation, as the Dr.
            had
            asserted,
            <hi>that the main ground of the
            peoples
            interest was
            founded
            upon the Apostles
            Canon, that a Bishop must be blameless, and of good
            report.</hi> Whereas
            where he can produce any one instance
            where people chuse
            a Bishop who was
            a Bishop before, there are sorty on the other side; and
            therefore their business was
            to chuse
            a Bishop to be ordained
            for them,
            and therefore could have no greater
            interest in the choice, than they
            had
            in the ordination
            of a Bishop, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            says
            was
            none, but I acknowledge to be as much as their good testimony
            of his life and manners,
            and of his faithful discharge of any
            inferiour
            office in the Church.</p>
          <p>
            And I have an
              unanswerable argument
              to prove, that this was
              the only interest they had
              (whatever they
            
            
            
            usurped
              by tumults
              and disorders)
              in the choice of a Bishop, and that their consent
              was
              not originally
              required
              to a Pastoral relation, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              founds
              it, and that is
              this, that there is
              no greater
              right assigned
              to them,
              in all antiquity in the choice of a Bishop, than they
              had
              in the choice of Deacons
              and Presbyters;
              they used
              indeed ordinarily
              to concern themselves more in this, because they thought it
              a matter of
              greater
              consequence, but the original right
              was
              the same; as is
              evident from
              the Scripture instance of the choice of
              Deacons,
              whereon most men
              found the right of the people,
              and from the universal practice of the Church in
              <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
              days,
              when Deacons,
              Readers,
              Presbyters,
              and all other Church-officers
              were
              as much chosen
              by the people, and by the fame right, that the
              Bishops
              were,
              and <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresly
              tells
              us, what the choice of Bishops
              and Presbyters
              was
              in those days,
              whom
              he calls
              by the common name of <hi>Seniores, honorem istum non pretio
              sed testimonio adepti, they obtained
              this honour not by purchase, but by
              testimony:</hi>
              that good report, which the people,
            
            
            who knew
              their lives
              and conversations,
              gave
              of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the interest of people in the choice of
              Deacons
              and Presbyters,
              could not be founded
              on the necessity of their consent in a Pastoral relation:
              the case is
              plain in Deacons,
              who were
              no Pastors,
              and yet ought no more to be made
              without the consent of the people than the Bishop; and in
              those first ages
              of the Church, Presbyters
              were
              never looked
              on as their Pastors
              (which name and office was
              peculiar to the Bishop) but as subordinate
              Ministers,
              who were
              imployed
              in such religious offices,
              as the Bishop pleased:
              the Bishops
              Parish or
              Diocess
              was
              not then divided
              into distinct Titles
              or Parishes,
              with their fix't Presbyters
              over them,
              which looks
              more like a Pastoral relation,
              but the whole Diocess
              lay in common, though there were
              several congregations
              in it for religious worship,
              as I think has
              been
              proved
              above, and the Bishop allotted
              his Presbyters
              their work and Province, as he saw
              the necessities
              of the Church require. Now if the consent of the people be
              founded
              only in a Pastoral relation,
            
            
            
            what gave
              them
              a right of consent in the Election of
              Presbyters
              and Deacons?
              the practice of the Church was
              the same in all, without the least
              notice
              taken
              of any different or greater
              interest the people had
              in the choice of their Bishop, than of any
              meaner
              Church-officers,
              the consent of the people to a Pastoral relation,
              being
              of no elder date than the rise of
              Independency,
              and never mentioned
              in all the writings
              of the ancient Fathers,
              as far as I can observe either in my own
              reading,
              or what more learned
              men
              have collected
              from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I examine Mr. B.'s reasons
              to prove the necessity of the peoples
              consent to constitute a Pastoral
              relation, I
              shall urge one argument against it; which
              is
              this. All the true Ministers
              of Christ, and Pastors
              of his Flock are Ministers
              of the Catholick
              Church, and have a Pastoral relation to the whole Church,
              and all Christian people
              are members
              of the Catholick
              Church, and are related
              to all the Pastors
              of it, which cannot possibly
              be owing
              to consent between Pastor and people. Every Christian Pastor
              is
              qualified
              for the exercise of the Pastoral
            
            
            office in any part of the world, and
              is
              bound
              to it, as he has
              opportunity
              to do it: Every Christian man is
              bound
              to communicate with all Christian
              Churches
              in the world, supposing
              nothing sinful in their communion,
              and to obey their Pastors,
              while he lives
              among them,
              though he never
              gave
              any consent to this Pastoral relation, but by
              consenting
              to become a Christian, and to submit to that
              authority
              which Christ has
              placed
              in his Church. I need not insist on this, which I have
              abundantly
              proved
              in what I have already discourst
              about the unity and communion of the
              Catholick
              Church, and if that hold good, as I shall conclude it
              does,
              till I see it fairly
              confuted,
              there can be no place for such a consent, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              or such a particular-Church-Covenant, as Dr. O.
              calls
              it, to found a Pastoral relation
              between Pastor and people. Christ who
              founded
              his Church hath
              set his Ministers
              over it, to instruct and govern his Church in his name, and
              by his authority, and whoever will be a Christian must
              submit to the authority of Christ, as
              visibly
              exercised
              by his Ministers,
              which makes
            
            
            
            a Catholick
              relation between all Pastors
              and Christian people; and as for a relation to a particular
              Church, private Christians
              are determined
              by the place of their habitation, if there be any Christian
              Church there; and a Bishop or Presbyter may be
              fixt
              in a particular Church, by the choice of the Prince, Clergy,
              or people, or by all together, as the
              Laws
              of any particular or national Church determine; and though
              it might be thought convenient in some
              cases,
              that the people were
              consulted
              in the choice, yet it cannot be necessary to a Pastoral
              relation, and so is
              not void and null without it: for we have a relation to all
              the Ministers
              of Christ antecedent to the notion of a
              particular
              Church and particular communion, and therefore cannot refuse
              obedience to him
              that is
              set over us in particular, though without our consent, if he
              be a true Minister of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            I proceed now to examine Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s
              proofs
              for the necessity of the peoples
              consent to the choice of their Bishop or Pastor, to found a
              Pastoral relation:
              and he argues
              from the universal practice of the Church, and from the
            
            
            nature of the thing. I mightily
              love arguments
              from the nature of things,
              which when rightly
              deduced,
              are always
              most plain and convincing;
              and therefore I shall begin my enquiry here, and do profess
              my self very willing
            
            to learn, and therefore am
              not afraid, <hi>that more light should put out my
              eyes,</hi>
              as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> suspects
              some of his Adversaries
              are; but if there be any such men,
              I would have them
              take courage, and venture their
              eyes,
              for Mr. B. is
              a very merciful man to his Readers
              upon this account, if they do not lose their
              eyes
              in fogs
              and mists,
              he will never put them
              out with too much light.
          </p>
          <p>
            He never indeed wants
              twenty arguments
              for any thing, and such a kind of number he
              has
              given
              us here, but I can make but three or four at most of
              them.
              1. That every man has
              a propriety in his own soul, and
              is
              more concerned
              to take care of it, than any one else, and therefore must
              chuse
              his own Pastor, to whom
              he will commit the care of his Soul. 2. From the necessity
              of the Pastoral office, and the faithful discharge of it. 3.
              That it is
              very unlikely, Princes
            
            
            
            and Pastors
              should chuse
              so well for people, as they will for themselves. 4. That no
              pretence of publick
              good and order can dispense with this duty of
              taking
              care of our Souls.
              This is
              the force of all he says,
              so far as I can understand it.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. The first he very industriously
              endeavours
              to prove, though I think no man ever
              denied,
              that we ought to take care of our
              souls,
              though the consequence be somewhat doubtful, of which more
              anon. But in his proof of this we are
              furnished
              with such admirable
              Politicks
              and Aphorisms
              for a Holy Commonwealth, as I fear will be found to
              overthrow all Civil as well as Ecclesiastical power. Thus in
              his first proposition he tells
              us, <hi>propriety is
              in order of nature antecedent to Regiment</hi> (or
              Government) which supposeth
              it, and is
              to order the use of it for <hi>common safety and good.</hi>
              But now he ought to have exercised
              his distinguishing
              faculty here, and told
              us what <hi>propriety</hi> he means,
              whether that propriety which every man
              has
              in himself, or that propriety which
              governours
              have in their Subjects:
              That propriety which Governours
            
            
            have in their Subjects
              is
              the foundation
              of Government: Thus God has
              a right to govern the world because he
              made
              it: this made
              <hi>Adam</hi> an
              Universal
              Monarch over his own Children;
              which power descended
              to the Heads
              of Families,
              reserving
              some authority
              to immediate Parents,
              and thus it was
              ordered
              by God himself in the Jewish State: The
              Princes
              of <hi>Israel</hi>
              being
              the heads
              of their Tribes
              and Families;
              and thus propriety is
              the foundation
              of Government still, not indeed a natural but
              acquired
              propriety, either by Conquest, Descent, or Election.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if he means
              every mans
              propriety in
              himself, it makes
              every man an
              absolute Prince in his own concernments,
              and so he adds
              4. <hi>self-government
              (as to power and obligation) is
              antecedent to humane publick
              government in order of nature, that
              is,
              has
              a more immutable right, which publick
              government
              does
              not destroy, but regulate. 6. Parents
              government is
              antecedent to Princes,
              and Princes
              cannot take it from them,
              nor disoblige their children,
              but self-government is
              more natural than Parents,
              and Parents
              and Princes
              must help it, but not destroy it:</hi> the Parent
            
            
            
            has
              more power over his children
              than the Prince, and a Child more power than his Parent; and
              thus every private
              man is
              the absolute governour
              of himself, by the law of nature.
          </p>
          <p>But not to examine now the looseness
            of these principles,
            nor what ill influence they may have upon civil government,
            especially
            upon an
            hereditary
            Monarchy (for I cannot see any reason why upon these
            principles,
            the people have not an
            inherent and immutable right to
            chuse
            their King, as well as their Bishop) I will
            readily
            grant, that every man has
            a greater
            right to his own soul than either Prince or Bishop, and
            is
            more nearly
            concerned
            to take care of it; but I do not see how Mr. B.
            proves
            from hence that every man has
            an
            inherent and unalterable right to
            chuse
            his own Pastor; indeed he does
            not offer one word of proof for it that I see, but
            takes
            it for so plain a consequence as
            needs
            no proof; and therefore I shall only
            offer a reason or
            two to shew,
            that this consequence is
            not so plain and certain.</p>
          <p n="1">
            1. Because mankind always
              had
              an
              equal right in their souls,
              that they have at this day, and yet this
              was
              never
            
            
            allowed
              them
              under any religion to chuse
              their own Priests
              and Pastors.
              Before the Law, as is
              generally
              believed,
              the Priesthood was
              annexed
              to the head of the Family, as the civil power
              was;
              under the Law God himself
              confined
              the Priesthood to a particular
              family and tribe: The family of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the tribe
              of <hi>Levi</hi> were
              separated
              for the service of the Altar and the Temple, and all the
              Ministers
              of Religion; and therefore in those
              days
              the people were
              denied
              the liberty of
              choice, though the Priests
              were
              never so ignorant and vicious, as it
              is
              plain they were
              in several ages
              of the Jewish Church. And when our Saviour himself
              came
              into the world, though he warned
              his Disciples
              against the leaven
              of the Scribes
              and Pharisees,
              yet he did
              not allow them
              to withdraw from their communion,
              and to chuse
              better for themselves, but on the other hand
              tells
              them,
              <hi>the Scribes
              and Pharisees
              sit</hi>
            
            <hi>in</hi> Moses'<hi>s
              seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that
              observe and do, but do not ye after their
              works,
              for they say, and do not.</hi> And when our
              Saviour himself
              instituted
              a Church he
            
            
            
            chose
              his Apostles
              himself, and commands
              all to hear them;
              and the Apostles
              followed
              this example, and by that authority they
              received
              from Christ, ordained
              others to succeed in their room, without the choice of the
              people (as Mr. B. himself acknowledges)
              and yet commands
              all Christians
              to be subject to them,
              as the Ministers
              of Christ; which was
              to impose
              Pastors
              on them
              without their consent either antecedent or
              consequent,
              any otherwise than as they knew
              themselves obliged
              chearfully
              to consent to such Pastors
              as were
              set over them
              by the Apostles,
              to whom
              the power belonged.

            2. Men
              who are so sensible of the worth of their
              souls,
              as this argument supposes,
              may take very great care of them,
              especially
              in such a Church, and such an
              age as this, without separating
              from the communion of the Church, though his Parish Minister
              be none of the best preachers,
              nor best and wisest
              men:
              In the daily appointed
              service of the Church they have the
              Scriptures
              read to them,
              and devout pious
              prayers
              in a language which they understand, and if it
              were
            
            
            no more, a man may provide very well for his soul by a
              diligent reading,
              or hearing
              the Scriptures
              read to them,
              and whatever men
              say, it argues
              no great opinion of the sufficiency
              of the Scriptures,
              to speak so meanly
              of the ordinary service of the Church, wherein the
              Scriptures
              are daily read, and the principal
              doctrines
              of faith piously
              and judiciously
              explained
              in the Catechism and homilies
              of the Church, as if people, who
              had
              no more, were
              in such a deplorable and desperate state for their
              souls.
              Which yet was
              thought a singular blessing
              at the beginning
              of the Reformation,
              and would be so still did
              men
              either understand, what kind of
              preaching
              the Church has
              had
              in most ages,
              or took
              not more pleasure in gratifying
              a wanton curiosity, and itching
              ears,
              than in saving
              their souls:
              but besides,
              how many pious books
              are all men
              furnished
              with who are desirous
              of saving
              knowledge? how many knowing
              Christians
              are there in most neighbourhoods,
              who, as Mr. B. says,
              are capable of giving
              very wholsome
              advice and counsel, and might make as good
              preachers
              as most of the ancient
            
            
            
            Primitive Fathers?
              How many learned,
              judicious, and pious Pastors
              are there in all parts
              of the Countrey,
              to whom
              they may privately
              resort in difficult cases
              for resolution, and make their private particular
              guides,
              when their own Parish Minister is
              not fit for that office? and a man who
              takes
              care of his soul, will rather chuse
              upon such occasions
              to ride or walk some miles,
              than to break the communion of the Church.
          </p>
          <p>So that all serious Christians,
            who love and take care of their
            souls,
            may provide very well for them
            in the communion
            of the Church, without having
            this liberty of chusing
            their own Pastor, when they do not like
            him
            who is
            set over them
            by the authority
            of Church and State: and therefore that care which
            men
            ought to take of their souls,
            and that right they have in them,
            does
            not necessarily
            prove the necessity of their own consent to a Pastoral
            relation.</p>
          <p>
            And as for other men,
              who take no care of their souls,
              I suppose Mr. B. does
              not so earnestly
              plead for their liberty of choice, which
              is
              not like to be a very good one; since, as Mr. B.
            
            
            says,
              <hi>it is
              natural, to generate the like, and for
              men
              to do, and chuse
              as they</hi>
            
            <hi>are, and as their Interest leads
              them:</hi>
              And if this be an
              argument against the choice of Princes
              and Patrons,
              I think it is
              no good argument for the choice of a vicious people.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. If that right men
              have to take care of their souls,
              be a good argument
              to prove their right to chuse
              their Pastors,
              methinks
              it proves
              somewhat more
              than Mr. B. will own, that they ought to consent to the
              choice, or have as much right in the choice of those
              persons,
              who are to be ordained
              Pastors,
              as in chusing,
              who shall be their particular Pastors.
              My reason is
              this, because if there be any error
              committed,
              the fundamental error is
              in ordaining
              unfit and unqualified
              Pastors;
              for since the people, as Mr. B.
              sayes,
              must chuse
              an
              ordained
              Pastor, if none were
              ordained
              but those, who are fit, they could never make
              an
              ill choice; nor were
              there such great reason
              to be curious about it; and if any unfit
              persons
              be ordained,
              they must fall to some bodies
              share, unless we will suppose more to be
              ordained,
              than there is
              any need of; which though
            
            
            
            I grant is
              often done,
              yet is
              contrary to Primitive practice, and both the Ancient and
              Modern Canons
              of the Church, which will not allow
              Ordinations,
              but to some Church or Title. And let us make a wild
              supposition for once, as Mr. B.
              makes
              many, when his cause requires
              it: suppose the Ordainers
              should be so generally
              corrupt in
              Faith or Manners
              themselves as to ordain none, or very few
              men
              duely
              qualified
              for the Pastoral Office, what would become of the
              peoples
              choice then? How would they take care of their
              souls,
              when there are none to chuse,
              who are fit to take care of them?
              And yet Mr. B. will not allow them
              any choice or consent, who shall be
              Ministers
              of Christ, but only who shall be theirs, which it
              is
              plain, is
              not a sufficient security to their
              souls,
              unless wise, and
              good, and faithful men
              are first ordained
              as objects
              of their choice.
          </p>
          <p n="4">
            4. That reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> assigns
              against their right and interest of choice and
            
            consent, <hi>who is
              fit, and shall be a Minister
              of Christ,</hi> is
              to the full as good a reason against their choice of their
              own Pastor, notwithstanding their
            
            
            right to take care of their souls.
              For if none <hi>be so fit to judge</hi> (of the fitness of
              men
              to be Ordained)
              <hi>as men
              and Seniors
              of the same Office, as Physicians
              are fit to judge, who is
              meet to be a Licensed
              Physician,</hi> then certainly
              those who are fittest
              to judge, who shall be a Minister,
              are fittest
              also to judge, to what people they shall discharge that
              Office. For the care of our souls
              (as far as concerns
              this matter) only requires
              us to chuse
              a Person fit to discharge a Pastoral
              Office; and therefore those, who are best able to judge of
              fitness for the Pastoral Office, are the most
              competent
              Judges,
              of such a choice too; and people take the best care of their
              souls,
              by committing
              the choice to better Judges
              than themselves.
          </p>
          <p n="5">
            5. There is
              as much hazard to the souls
              of men
              in the choice of their own Pastors,
              as in any other way. People who are careless of Religion,
              will make as careless a choice too; those who are giddy,
              will be fickle and unconstant
              to any, and soon repent of their choice, and either depose
              their Pastor, if that liberty also be
              granted,
              or not regard him,
              which makes
              that relation useless. Those who are
              erroneous,
            
            
            
            will chuse
              a Pastor of their own mind, who shall not correct, but
              confirm their
              errors;
              and those who are injudicious and ignorant, which I doubt
              is
              the case of many, who are thought very
              knowing
              Christians,
              will chuse
              a man of noise and passion, before
              the most grave and experienced
              Divine; and some men
              of better judgments,
              or who are over-ruled
              by wise men,
              will make a wise choice: but all that I conclude from hence
              is,
              that the choice of the people, is
              not the best way to take care of their
              souls,
              and therefore we have no reason to think, that our Saviour
              appointed
              this way.
          </p>
          <p n="6">
            6. There are other Persons
              accountable
              to God for peoples
              souls,
              as well as themselves, I mean the
              Governours
              of Church and State; and if the choice of fit
              Pastors
              be of such mighty consequence
              as indeed it is,
              they certainly
              ought to have the over-ruling
              power in this matter; for they are
              accountable
              to God as Governours,
              which supposes,
              that they have a superiour
              Power and Government; and yet if the people have a Negative
              Voice, that no man can be their Pastor without
            
            
            their consent, there are infinite
              cases
              wherein Governours
              have no authority
              at all to take care of them.
              And as people have a right in their
              souls,
              so I suppose Governours
              have in theirs, and yet they forfeit their own
              souls,
              by not taking
              care of the peoples.
              And as for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              urges,
              that <hi>the</hi>
            
            <hi>gain or loss is
              more the Patients;
              than the Imposers:
              it is
              their own souls,
              that are like to be profited
              and saved
              by needful
              helps,
              or lost
              for want of them,
              and therefore it most concerns
              themselves to know what helps
              they chuse.</hi>
              It is
              not upon all accounts
              true: For the Magistrates
              and Imposers
              soul is
              as much concerned
              as theirs, nay, he is
              to give an
              account for all those souls,
              which suffer through his neglect, but they are to account
              only every man for themselves;
              and he is
              less excusable, if he do not exercise that power he
              has
              to save men
              even against their wills;
              than private men
              are for not making
              greater
              improvements,
              when they wanted
              better helps,
              which they could not have without
              disturbing
              publick
              Peace and Order: though every man
              is
              most concerned
              to take care of his soul, yet he
              has
              no right to damn his
            
            
            
            soul, though he shall be the greatest
              sufferer by it, which yet is
              the greatest
              force of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s argument, for if a man have not
              right to damn his soul, he has
              not the greatest
              right to chuse
              his own Pastor, because it is
              as possible he
              may make a bad as a good choice, and those
              Governours
              who are concerned
              to use their power and interest
              to prevent mens damning
              themselves,
              and are accountable to God, if they do not; have
              certainly
              power power to govern and over-rule people in the choice of
              their Pastors,
              and to make good provision for them
              against their wills,
              which destroyes
              their inherent
              and unalterable right of choice.

            7. I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to consider, whether it
              is
              likely, that God who is
              the God of Peace and Order, should appoint such a way of
              choice, as in the very nature of it,
              considering
              the state of mankind in this world, must
              inevitably
              break the Church into ten thousand
              factions:
              For by Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s argument,
              every single man is
              to chuse
              for himself, and must no more be
              over-ruled
              by a Majority of Votes
              in such an
              Election, than be imposed
              on by King, Bishops,
              or Patrons:
              for every
            
            
            man is
              nearest
              to himself, and most concerned
              for his own soul: and Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              expresly
              owns,
              that though the
            
            person be chose
              by the major part of the people of any Church, and
              rejected
              by some few odd persons,
              he is
              by this means,
              <hi>the Churches
              Pastor, but not the refusers:</hi>
              and upon these principles
              it is
              almost impossible there ever should be a popular Election
              without dividing
              the Church; for it is
              next an
              impossibility, that five hundred
              Persons,
              suppose, which make no large Church, should every man
              consent in the same Persons.
              I am
              sure it was
              otherwise in Dr. <hi>Seaman</hi>'s Church, which as I
              am
              informed
              had
              not above thirty Electors,
              and yet after Prayer, and Fasting,
              and Sermons
              to direct them
              in their choice, they divided
              into two Churches,
              and chose
              two distinct Pastors;
              and so they may do every Week if they please,
              according
              to these principles,
              till every two or three of them
              make a Church by themselves.

            2. His next head of arguments
              is
              from the necessity of the Pastoral
              Office, and the
              faithful discharge of it. Thus <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. he
              tells
              us, <hi>Scripture
            
            
            
            and experience tells
              us, that God worketh</hi>
            
            <hi>usually
              according
              to the aptitude of means
              and instruments;
              and learned
              experienced
              Physicians
              cure more than the ignorant,
              rash and slothful; and good Scholars
              make their Pulpits
              more learned,
              than the ignorant do; and skilful, able,
              experienced,
              holy Pastors
              convert and edifie
              much more than ignorant and vicious
              men.
              And means
              must accordingly
              be chosen.
              13. If the Pastoral work skilfully
              and faithfully
              done,
              be needful, it must not be neglected,
              whoever forbid it. If it be not needful, what
              is
              the Church of</hi> England <hi>good for, more than
              Infidels,
              or at least than</hi> Moscovites?
              <hi>and for what are they maintained
              with Tythes,
              Glebe, and all the Dignities,
              and Honours,
              and Wealth they have? and for what do
              men
              so much contend for them?</hi>
              If I knew
              what needed
              answer in this, I think it were
              no hard matter to answer it. For,

            1. Who denyes
              the necessity of the Pastoral Office? But cannot there be
              Wise, Learned,
              Skilful, Experienced
              Pastors,
              unless the people chuse
              them?
              Are there none such but among Schismaticks?
              and are none fit to chuse
              them
              but Schismaticks?
              are such giddy

              to chuse
              skilful, experienced

          <p n="2">2. What does
            the dispute of Preaching
            in opposition to the Authority of Church and State,
            signifie
            to the choice of the people? unless he
            thinks
            people ought to chuse
            none but those, whom
            their Governours
            refuse. But are those likely to be the most skilful, holy
            Pastors,
            who make a Schism themselves, and draw people into it? I pray
            God forgive the giddiness and folly of such people, who by the
            insinuation
            of such Preachers
            involve themselves in the guilt of a

          <p n="3">
            3. What occasion was
              there for those scurrilous reflections
              upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as little better than
              <hi>Infidels</hi>
              or <hi>Moscovites,</hi>
              and unworthy to be maintained
              by Tythes,
              and Glebe, and Honours,
              <hi>c.</hi> For does
              the Church of <hi>England</hi> cry down the Pastoral Office
              as needless? Is
              there any Church in the World, which so
              abounds
              with learned,
              skilful and experienced
              Pastors?
              But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others of his faction, who pretend
              so much to despise Tythes,
              and Dignities,
              and Honour, by those frequent
            
            
            
            flurts
              at Church-preferments,
              and the wealth of Church-men,
              which I can assure him,
              excepting
              some few instances,
              is
              not great, plainly
              shew,
              what is
              the object of their envy, and that they have as much mind to
              the Tythes
              and Temples
              as to the people, unless they can command their
              Purses
              too, which many of them
              have great skill in.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. The substance of his third argument
              is,
              that it is
              very unlikely, that Princes
              and Patrons
              should chuse
              so well for the people, as they will
              themselves.
              This he manages
              in <hi>Proposition</hi>
            
            or <hi>Argument</hi> 14. (for I know not well what to call
              it) and proves
              it, because
              <hi>it is
              hard for a rich man to be saved,
              and few of them
              prove good: that the Clergy themselves do not say, that all
              the Patrons
              in</hi> England <hi>are wise and
              pious; many
              Parliaments
              have by our Church men
              been
              deeply
              accused,
              and most Parliament-men
              I think are Patrons:
              others say, most Patrons
              not chosen
              to Parliaments,
              are worse: some Preachers
              complain of great men
              for fornication, drunkenness, excess, idleness, yea,
              Atheism and
              Infidelity: If many or any be such, are they likely to
              chuse
              such Pastors,
            
            
            as all godly men
              may trust in so great a case? or would not such
              Princes
              chuse
              such Bishops?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here Mr. B. has
              forgot
              his good rule, and shews
              that he was
              not in earnest,
              when he said
              it, but spoke
              it in contempt
              and drollery, that our present Dissenters
              are the <hi>generality of the most religious and sober
              people of the Land</hi>
            
            <hi>(alwayes
              excepting
              the King and Parliment,
              and those that must be still excepted.)</hi>
              It is
              a mighty priviledge
              Schismaticks
              have, to be witty above other men;
              for the Cause of God sanctifies
              the boldest
              reflections
              upon all Superiours
              in Church or State.
          </p>
          <p>But his argument is
            this, most Patrons
            are bad men,
            and therefore will chuse
            Pastors
            like themselves: 1. This is
            matter of fact, and confuted
            by experience;
            either most Patrons
            are not bad men,
            or those who are bad may make a good choice; for there never
            was
            a better Clergy in <hi>England</hi> than
            is
            at this day, nor less need of their rude
            clamours.</p>
          <p n="2">
            2. I fear the generality of people are as bad as
              Patrons,
              and therefore as likely to make as bad a choice, and then
              there is
              no remedy but the godly
            
            
            
            people must be Schismaticks,
              and chuse
              for themselves, unless they can
              perswade
              these ungodly people who go to Church, to let the
              Saints
              chuse
              for them.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. It does
              not alwayes
              follow, that a bad man will chuse
              a bad Minister: many who are very wicked
              themselvs,
              will not allow their Children
              to be so, and of all things
              abhor a vicious Clergy-man:
              and their interest may oblige
              them
              to gratifie
              their Neighbours
              or Tenants,
              or some powerful Intercessor.
              Mr. B. mightily
              mistakes
              mankind, if he
              imagine that every bad man thinks
              himself concerned
              to propagate
              Vice. And here I have Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s authority for it, who
              tells
              us, that <hi>it is
              known
              by experience, that learning
              and great worth doth as light so reveal it self to humane
              nature, that usually
              most of those, who are loth
              to be holy themselves, would have a Saint and
              an
              able man.</hi> The danger of such
              choices
              is
              not so much meerly
              from men,
              who are vicious
              themselves, as from Atheists,
              Papists
              or Fanaticks,
              who if they can meet with any such
              Persons
              as are likely to prove a scandal to the Church and to
              Religion, too often prefer them
            
            
            before the most learned,
              pious and experienced
              Pastors.
          </p>
          <p n="4">4. Though Princes
            may be very bad themselves, it is
            so much their Civil interest, to have a sober and
            learned
            Clergy, to keep people in good order and government, that we
            have little reason to suspect, that they will lay a design to
            propagate Vice and Irreligion,
            which is
            the most likely way to undermine their own
            Thrones.
            So that there is
            more probability that Patrons
            and Princes,
            though bad themselves,
            should make good provision of able
            Pastors,
            than that a wild, giddy, factious people should.</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. Another thing he insinuates
              not as a direct argument, but to prevent
              objections:
              for he could not but be sensible, that that extravagant
              power he allowed
              the people, would disturb all good order and government in
              the Church, and expose it to perpetual
              Factions
              and Schisms:
              and therefore he rejects
              the pretence of publick
            
            good, and publick
              government as of no consideration in this matter. He
              argues
              from that care all men
              must take to please God and save their
              souls,
              to prove that right they have to
            
            
            
            chuse
              their own Pastors,
              and sayes,
              <hi>the obligation to please God, and obtain salvation, and
              escape Sin and Hell</hi> (and consequently
              in order to this, to chuse
              their own Pastors,
              for to that end it is
              alledged)
              <hi>is
              so great, that no man is
              to pretend publick
              good, or the will of man against it: and self-government (as
              to power and obligation is
              antecedent to humane
              publick
              government in order of nature:
              and publick
              government doth not destroy it, but regulate it; and
              therefore is
              not for destruction, but edification. The end of
              self-government is
              so much to please God, and save our
              souls,
              that no man can on pretence of humane
              government
              disoblige us from it.</hi> All this
              is
              to prove the unalterable right of
              people in the
              choice of their Pastors,
              and if he had
              stated
              the case so, every body would have
              startled
              at it, that men
              are bound
              not to quit their right in the choice of their Pastor,
              though it might be for the publick
              good of the Church, and for the peace and order of
              publick
              government; and therefore he chuses
              to lay the stress upon pleasing
              God; and saving
              their souls;
              <hi>that no man is
              to pretend publick
              good and the will of man against this;</hi> nor
              did
              any man ever
            
            
            pretend this, that I know of: but the question
              is,
              whether the right of chusing
              their own Pastors
              be so necessary to please God and to save their
              souls,
              that no consideration of publick
              good and publick
              government, no regard to the peace of the Church, and
              obedience to
              our Prince, should make it our duty to dispense with it: for
              what he speaks
              here in general of pleasing
              God, and saving
              our souls,
              must be restrained
              to the thing he was
              to prove, if it be any thing to his purpose, and so it ought
              to be explained
              in these words,
              that <hi>the obligation to chuse
              our own Pastors
              in order to please God and obtain salvation, and escape sin
              and Hell, is
              so great, that no man is
              to pretend publick
              good, or the will of man against it;</hi> a proposition
              which I suppose he will not care to stand to, when he cannot
              take Sanctuary in general terms;
              for as any man with half an
              eye may discover
              in his Answer to the <hi>Dean,</hi> this
              is
              Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way to make wild and lewd
              suppositions,
              and to speak in loose and general
              terms,
              and if he be charged
              with that sense, which the design and series of his
              discourse requires,
              he denyes
              the charge, and rather chuses
              to
            
            
            
            be thought impertinent in his answers,
              than to own what he cannot defend.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is
              the substance of all his reasoning,
              to prove the right of the people
              to chuse
              their own Pastors,
              unless any should think there were
              any force in a comparison or two, which he
              takes
              I perceive for parallel cases,
              and alwayes
              uses
              in this argument; that every man
              has
              liberty to chuse
              his Physician
              and his Wife; and that a Prince cannot impose a Physician on
              them,
              <hi>who they believe is
              like to kill them
              by ignorance,
              error, or treachery,</hi> c. Mr. B.
              repeats
              this so often, as if he thought there
              were
              great weight in it, and yet the distance
              is
              as wide as between a private concern, and
              publick
              government.
              The Prince is
              not intrusted
              with mens private concernments,
              any otherwise than as they have
              an
              influence
              upon publick
              government, but the care of the Church and of Religion
              is
              as much his charge and Province, as any other part of
              government; Schisms
              in the Church are destructive to Religion and the
              souls
              of men,
              and very often occasion factions
              in the State, and threaten
              the publick
              peace; and yet if every Subject
              has
              such an
            
            
            uncontroulable
              power of chusing
              his Pastor, it is
              impossible ever to see an
              end of divisions,
              while they entertain different opinions,
              and pass such different
              judgements
              upon men
              and things.
              And whereas Mr. B. thinks
              the greatest
              security consists
              in a great many negative Votes,
              that Prince, Patrons,
              Bishops,
              people should each of them
              be able to make void an
              Election, I confess I see no other security in it, but that
              there never shall be a choice without
              Schism; for though it were
              possible,
              that the Prince or Patron, and Bishop, and majority of
              people should agree, this does
              not oblige the refusers,
              who may if they please separate
              into a distinct Church under a Pastor
              of their own.

          <p>
            Having
              thus examined
              his reasons
              for the peoples
              right of choice, consent or refusal (call it which you will,
              for it comes
              much to one) of their particular
              Pastors,
              let us now briefly
              consider the
              historical account he has
              given
              of the practice of the Church in this matter. I have not now
              either time or Books
              at hand to examine his particular
              testimonies,
              but shall make some such general
              remarks,
              as may be
            
            
            
            sufficient for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. I observe, that neither in his
              <hi>Answer</hi>
              to the <hi>Dean,</hi> nor in his <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> he
              has
              urged
              one Scripture precept
              or example for such a choice,
            
            though the <hi>Dean</hi> had
              particularly
              answered
              those places,
              which are usually
              alledged
              for it, which he passes
              over without any notice. He quotes
              indeed some
              places
              of Scripture, but to what purpose I cannot tell,
              surely
              not to prove the peoples
              right to chuse
              their Pastors,
              such are these, <hi>Take heed how ye hear,</hi> which may be
              done
              without
              chusing
              their Pastors,
              and the doing
              of it will prevent any danger form
              them,
              whom
              they do not chuse:
              <hi>beware of
              false Prophets,</hi>
              but Prophets
              whether true or false, were
              never chose
              by the people; <hi>and their leaven,</hi>
              he should have said
              <hi>the leaven
              of the Scribes
              and Pharisees,</hi>
              who were
              no fixt
              Pastors
              neither in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s sense, nor
              chose
              by the people, much less by Christs
              Disciples,
              who yet were
              commanded
              to hear them,
              but to beware of their leaven;
              and let them
              serve the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as Christ
              commanded
              his Disciples
              to serve the Pharisees,
              to hear them,
              but to beware
            
            
            of any corrupt Doctrines
              they taught,
              and we will not quarrel with them.
              <hi>Beware of the concision,</hi> that
              is,
              the Jewish Separatists,
              who would not communicate with the
              Gentiles:
              <hi>A man that is
              an
              heretick
              avoid;</hi> a command
              given
              to a Bishop, not to the people: and though the
              peoples
              duty, when the heresie
              is
              notorious, yet it does
              not prove their right to chuse
              their Pastors.
              <hi>Let no man deceive you:</hi> so we say also, and yet
              think not a popular
              election of Pastors
              necessary; <hi>Those that cause
              divisions
              and offences
              contrary to the doctrine ye have
              learned
              avoid---from such turn away:</hi> that
              is,
              from all Schismaticks;
              thus we teach our people, and for this Mr. B. and others are
              so angry with the <hi>Dean.</hi> Mr. B. I confess
              has
              a greater
              reach than other men,
              and so he had
              need to have, who can find out the
              peoples
              right to chuse
              their Pastors
              in such Texts
              as these.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would enquire
              then of him,
              since he has
              no Scripture proof of this, how he
              finds
              a Divine authority for it, or if he have no Divine
              authority, how he dares
              set it up in opposition to publick
              Laws
              and Constitutions
              to all the authority
            
            
            
            of Church and State, as a right unalterable by any humane
              power.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. As for his later
              authorities
              out of Councils
              and Fathers,
              I would desire to know under what notion he
              alledges
              them:
              whether as witnesses
              of the Apostolical practice, or as a
              binding
              authority to all the succeeding
              Ages
              of the Church. The second I presume he will not own, but if
              he own the first, he must allow
              them
              to be very good witnesses
              in other matters
              of fact as well as this: and then the dispute about Diocesan
              Episcopacy, and the right of Patriarchs
              and Metropolitans
              is
              out of doors,
              which are expresly
              confirmed
              by the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, to whose authority he
              appeals
              in this matter. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              has
              a refuge and distinction at hand in these
              cases:
              what he likes,
              is
              Apostolical practice; what he does
              not, is
              decreed
              by humane wisdom: as he distinguishes
              in the General
              Council called
              <hi>Quinosextum,</hi> where he finds
              one Decree, as he thinks,
              for the peoples
              election, and this is
              very well; but <hi>the same Council by humane wisdom
              decreed,</hi>
              Can. 38. <hi>That whatsoever alteration the Imperial power
              maketh
              on any City, the Ecclesiastical
            
            
            order follow it: Which,</hi> he
              says,
              <hi>is
              the</hi>
            
            <hi>way by which humane order overthrew
              divine order and
              institutions:</hi>
              he means
              his Parochial Episcopacy; and yet these are both
              matters
              of fact which they were
              equally
              capable of knowing
              and testifying,
              and therefore their authority is
              good in both or in neither; and there
              is
              more to be said
              even from the Apostolical age, for this order of
              planting
              Churches
              than for popular Elections.

            But we have an
              admirable instance of his partiality to his cause in the
              second
              <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; when he
              alledges
              it for himself, he says,
              <hi>though by servility they were
              for images,
              yet they</hi>
            
            <hi>held
              to the old Church Canons
              for Elections,</hi>
              and thus far their authority is
              very good. When the <hi>Dean</hi> a little after
              produces
              a testimony out of the same Council against
              him:
              He answers,
              <hi>Had
              this been
              true, it would not much move me, that these two
              Councils</hi>
            
            <hi>that set up Image-worship, and
              shewed
              much wickedness, should contradict the Apostolical and
              Catholick
              practice and constitutions.</hi>
              So different a case is
              it to speak for or against Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s darling
              opinions.
          </p>

            3. I observe most of his authorities
              are of a very late date: in his answer to the <hi>Dean</hi>
              he begins
              with the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which
              was
              in the fourth Century; and though he
              tells
              us there, <hi>I have formerly
              named
              elder Testimonies
              not denied,</hi>
              I have searcht
              his <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> in that Chapter, where he
              purposely
              proves
              this matter,
              and I can find but one passage out of <hi>Clemens
              Romanus,</hi> and another of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which I
              think will not do his business.
          </p>
          <p>
            His testimony from <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi>
              in his famed
              Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
              concerns
              the practice of the Apostles,
              and those who succeeded
              them
              in ordaining
              Bishops
              or Elders:
              Which was
              <hi>consensu universae ecclesiae,</hi> the Greek
              words
              are , <hi>the whole Church
              being
              pleased
              with it,</hi> which I hope the Church may be, where there
              is
              a wise and good choice, whether the
              peoples
              consent be antecedently
              required
              or not; much less though they be not
              allowed
              to chuse
              by Majority of votes,
              which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sometimes
              requires.
              And that this is
              all <hi>Clemens</hi> meant,
              is
            
            evident from what he said
              immediate_y
            
            
            before; that the Apostle appointed
              their first fruits
              <hi>(i. e.</hi> those who were
              first converted
              to Christianity) to be Bishops
              and Deacons
              of those, who should afterwards
              believe, which plainly
              excludes any popular election, when there
              were
              not people to chuse
              them,
              _ay he
              tell us expresly
              how the Apostles
              chose,
              ,
            
            trying
              them
              by the Spirit; which I suppose signifies
              the gift of discerning
              Spirits,
              which the Apostles
              had:
              and adds
              that this was
              foretold
              in the ancient
              prophets;
              <hi>and what wonder then was
              it, that</hi>
            
            <hi>those who were
              intrusted
              by God in Christ with this work</hi> (of
              ordaining
              Bishops
              and Deacons)
              <hi>did
              accordingly
              do it:</hi> Here we see the appointing
              or placing
              Bishops
              and Deacons
              is
              not referred
              to the consent
              and choice of the people, but to the Authority of God
              given
              them
              by Christ: which in the following
              words
              he parallels
              with <hi>Moses</hi>
              his giving
              the Priesthood to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
              Sons,
              without the consent of the whole
              congregation,
              nay against it, as was
              evident from
              the contention of the other
            
            
            
            tribes
              about the Priesthood, which was
              decided
              by a miracle, by the blossoming
              of <hi>Aaron's</hi> _od.
              And if the Apostles
              ordained
              Bishops
              and Deacons
              by as absolute an
              authority as
              this, the Church might be pleased
              with what they did,
              but could not contradict it: these
              things
              the <hi>Dean</hi> had
              more largely
              discoursed
              before, to
              which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> returns
              not one word of answer: and yet <hi>Clemens</hi>
              says
              that this was
              done
              not only by the Apostles
              but <hi>by other eminent men</hi>
              , that is,
              Evangelists
              or Bishops
              authorized
              by the Apostles
              for this work, and takes
              no notice of any alteration
              in his days,
              that now the chief power was
              in the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he every where insists
              on that saying
              of St. <hi>Cyprian, that the people</hi>
            
            <hi>had
              the greatest
              power to chuse
              worthy Bishops,
              or to refuse the unworthy.</hi> The <hi>Dean</hi> at large
              answered
              this testimony,
              and made
              it appear, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              gave
              no other right to the people
              in the Elections
              of Bishops,
              but to be present at them,
              and to bear testimony
              of their lives
              and conversations,
              as is
              evident from the whole series of that Epistle; this he
              confirms
            
            
            by the practice of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who in
              imitation of the Christians
              in the choice of their Bishops,
              <hi>proposed
              the names
              of his civil officers
              to the people,
              to hear what they had
              to object against them;</hi>
              which proves,
              that he who lived
              among them,
              and might be presumed
              to know the nature of such publick
              Elections,
              understood
              no more but that the people were
              to be witnesses
              of the good or bad lives
              of those to be ordained
              Bishops,
              for he never intended
              the people should chuse
              his officers,
              in imitation of the Christians;
              and confirms
              it by a testimony of <hi>Origen</hi>
              concerning
              this practice and the nature of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To all this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> replies
              little, and nothing to the purpose; but only that the
              words
              signifie
              more than testimony:
              <hi>for the chief chusing
              power of the worthy is
              more than testimony of fact:</hi> but
              chusing
              is
              a word of a large signification,
              and may be given
              to all, who any way contribute to the choice, whether by
              testimony, or vote and suffrage, and therefore we must
              determine the
              sense of any particular place where it
              is
              used,
              by the circumstances
              of the discourse, not from the
            
            
            
            largest
              and most comprehensive signification
              of the word: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              says,
              <hi>these words
              signifie
              more than testimony [by publick
              judgement and testimony be approved
              worthy and meet]</hi> but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should have
              given
              us the whole sentence,
              <hi>That the Bishop</hi>
            
            <hi>should be chosen,
              the people
              being
              present and looking
              on, and be found worthy
              by publick
              judgement and testimony,</hi> where there
              is
              a manifest
              difference made
              between the choice of the Bishop, and his
              publick
              approbation
              as worthy of that office, the first
              is
              the work of the Bishops,
              who were
              the Electors
              and Ordainers;
              the second the peoples
              work, who were
              therefore to be present to give
              judgement or
              testimony; for there is
              a great difference between chusing
              the Bishop, the people being
              present, which is
              all St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says;
              and that the people being
              present, should chuse
              their Bishop; and it is
              one thing to give testimony to a man as worthy of the
              Episcopal office, and another thing to
              chuse
              him;
              for many men
              may have the like testimony of equal
              merit, when only
              one is
              chose:
              but he
            
            
            adds,
              it is
              said
              <hi>(that by the suffrage of the whole fraternity the
              Episcopacy be delivered
              to him)</hi>
              which refers
              to the choice of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and yet there he
              makes
              a difference between
              <hi>the suffrage of the</hi>
            
            <hi>fraternity, and the judgement
              of the Bishops,</hi>
              which supposes
              that the Bishops
              had
              a superiour
              power to judge of their suffrages:
              and yet what these suffrages
              were
              we are told
              before;
              <hi>that that may be a</hi>
            
            <hi>just and regular ordination,
              which is
              examined
              by the judgement and suffrage
              of all.</hi> So that the suffrage of the people
              concerned
              only the examination of the worth and fitness of the Bishop
              to be ordained.
          </p>
          <p>
            What he adds
              about the particular case I shall not now consider, to avoid
              prolixity, since we are secure of the general practice, and
              whoever will compare the Deans
              and Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s arguments
              together will need no answer, and therefore I shall only
              observe one thing more from St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epistle,
              that the Election of the Bishops
              in
            
            
            
            the presence and under the eye of the people, as he
              speaks,
              was
              not in those days
              the universal practice of the Church, and therefore can be
              no argument
              against our Church at this day; for though he
              thinks
              it a Divine and Apostolical tradition and practice, yet he
              says,
              this custom of chusing
              Bishops
              in the presence of the people was
              observed
            
            not in all, but almost in all provinces:
              and yet he does
              not reject or condemn the Bishops
              of those Provinces,
              where it was
              not observed.
          </p>
          <p>The like arts
            he has
            used
            with the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> He
            says,
            <hi>the ninth
            and tenth
            Canons
            of the first great</hi> Nicene <hi>Council

            this to the peoples
            Election; for those who are elected
            by the people are to be deposed
            also, if they were
            scandalous,
            by these Canons:
            for if men
            were
            perswaded
            against the Canons,
            to impose hands
            upon such, they were
            not to be received.</p>

            what that consent is,
              which therefore we must learn from more ancient

              to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in these matters:

              and ordinations
              is
              there given
              to the Arch-Bishop, and though the
              people of the
              Diocess
              desire any one against the Arch-Bishops
              will, he is
              not to be admitted;
              <hi>but if the election be canonically
              made
              with the consent of the Arch-Bishop and
              Bishops,
              and some few of the people oppose it, if they please, they
              may determine it by the majority of

              is
              plain the people have nothing to do to take one or other,
              nor is
              here any mention of the <hi>most blameless;</hi> but the
              Arch-Bishop
              and Bishops
              may if they please

              the people so far, as to determine
              the controversie
              by the majority of votes:
              which supposes
              that they are not bound
              to do it.

          <p>His quotation out <hi>of the</hi> Roman <hi>Council
            under</hi> Sylvester is
            not much better
            than this, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says,
            that Council decreed
            <hi>(no Bishop shall ordain any Clerk,</hi> nisi cum omni
            adunat ecclesi, <hi>but with all the Church
            united.)</hi>
            That this is
            said
            to be decreed
            by that Council I grant, but <hi>cum omni adunat
            ecclesi</hi> is
            no more than <hi>plebe praesente</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
            the Church or people being
            present, and what that is,
            we have already heard.</p>
          <p n="4">
            4. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself has
              taken
              off the force of most of these authorities
              alledged
              by him,
              by his distinction between
              the right of the people in consenting
              to Ordination of Bishops,
              and their right to chuse,
              who shall be theirs. He denyes,
              as I observed
              before, that
              either <hi>Magistrates
              or people are Judges
              who is
              fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ in general, but
              the Ordainers
              and the Person himself conjunct.</hi> And yet it
              is
              evident to all men,
              who will be at the trouble to examine it, that most, if not
              all his testimonies
              concern the Ordination of Bishops.
            
            
            Thus <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the

              several others alledged
              by him;
              it being
              a very unusual
              thing either to translate Bishops
              from one Church to another, or to ordain a Bishop but to
              some Church.

            Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems
              to be sensible of this inconvenience, and
              does
              what he can to deliver himself from it, but to no purpose:
              He <hi>distinguishes
              between</hi>
            
            <hi>giving
              the power, and concurring
              with other causes
              to give a receptivity to the Person that must have it, the
              peoples
              consent
              is
              the</hi> causa partialis <hi>of receptivity and
              capacity:</hi> and yet the people no
              Judges,
              Who must have this power? There are but two
              things
              required
              in Ordinations,
              the giving
              the power or judging
              to whom
              it should be given.
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> acknowledges,
              that the people neither give the power, nor are
              Judges
              who is
              fit, or shall be a Minister of Christ, much less can they
              determine by
              votes,
              who shall be the man; and let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> now tell me
              what this capacity and receptivity
            
            
            
            is,
              which the people give.
          </p>
          <p>But he would fain recant what he
            has
            granted,
            and proved
            that the people
            have some power in ordination, in these
            words:
            <hi>But what signifie
            these words
            (the ordination of our Collegue</hi>
            Sabinus <hi>by the suffrage of the whole
            fraternity,
            and by the judgement of the Bishops)
            is
            not this as much power as we plead for?</hi> Yes Sir, and a
            great deal more, for you have given
            away all power in ordinations;
            but we own with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the people are
            proper witnesses
            of their conversations,
            which I have already shown
            is
            all he means
            by the suffrage of the people.</p>
          <p>
            A little after he thinks
              upon another distinction. <hi>It
              was
              not usual to ordain</hi> sine titulo, <hi>and the
              ordainers
              did
              two things
              at once. 1. Judge absolutely
              who shall be a Minister of Christ. 2. Judge with the Church
              to which he was
              ordained</hi>
            
            <hi>(elders
              and people) who was
              fit for that Church, and should be theirs:</hi> but this
              is
              all Romance and fiction to serve a cause: the action
              was
              but one, and considered
              as one, whatever distinctions
              and different respects
              a metaphysical
              wit may find in it; when any
            
            
            Church was
              empty, the neighbour Bishops,
              and the Clergy and people of the vacant Church
              met
              for the choice of a new Bishop for that Church: The people
              gave
              testimony of his life and manners,
              the Bishops
              judged
              of his other Pastoral qualifications,
              and if they could agree in the same man, he
              was
              ordained
              their Bishop;
              but there was
              no consideration at all, whether he should be a Bishop in
              general, but whether he should be Bishop of that Church: and
              therefore it is
              evident, the people have no more power in
              chusing
              their Bishop, than they have in
              making
              a Bishop, which was
              the very same action; and therefore
              according
              to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s principles
              they have none at all, but we allow that
              according
              to the ancient practice and constitutions
              of the Church, they were
              witnesses
              of their conversation, and may be so still.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I confess he has
              proved,
              that the people in many places,
              especially
              when there were
              different interests
              and perswasions
              among them,
              did
              sometimes
              by noise and tumults,
              and open force over-rule the Election against the consent of
              Prince, Bishops
            
            
            
            and Clergy; and if this be thought sufficient to give a
              right, our dissenting
              people may, as indeed they do, follow their example, and set
              up Ministers
              to themselves in defiance of Authority and
              Laws.
          </p>
          <p>As for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers
            to that historical account the <hi>Dean</hi>
            has
            given
            of these popular Elections,
            it is
            so inconsiderable,
            and so full of shifts,
            that no man who reads
            both with any care, will desire any farther vindication of it:
            and therefore I shall only give some
            instances
            of his way of answering.
            I have already considered
            what he answers
            to the first thing alledged
            by the <hi>Dean, that the main ground of the
            peoples
            interest was
            founded
            on the Apostles
            Canon, That a Bishop must be blameless and of good
            report.</hi></p>
          <p>
            The second thing alledged
              by the <hi>Dean</hi> is,
              <hi>that the people upon this assuming</hi>
            
            <hi>the power of elections,
              caused
              great disturbance and disorder in the Church.</hi> To this
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers
              1. <hi>And yet for all these disorders,
              the Church deprived
              not the people of their priviledge:</hi>
              and why was
              it? because they could not. For <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi>
              St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Origen,</hi> as the
              <hi>Dean</hi> proved,
            
            
            declared
              their dislike of it, and how desirous they
              were
              it should be altered,
              which me-thinks
              is
              a plain argument, that they did
              not believe it to be an
              Inherent and unalterable right, either by the Law of Nature,
              or a Divine Institution,
              for if they had
              such wise and good men
              would not have desired
              the alteration of it.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. He answers,
              that all these disorders,
              which are charged
              upon the people,
              were
              owing
              to the ambition of Clergy men:
              <hi>the aspiring
              Prelates
              seeking
              Patriarchates
              and B_shopricks,
              became
              as so many Captains
              at War, and gathered
              Monks,
              Clergy and people to strive and fight for
              them.</hi>
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> must think very
              meanly
              of his Readers,
              when he would perswade
              them,
              that this was
              alwayes
              the case, though sometimes
              I grant it was
              so; but is
              this any better
              argument for the choice of the people, that they are so many
              too's in the hands
              of aspiring
              men,
              to give great disturbance to Church and
              St_te?
              the inconveniencies
              of popular elections
              it seems
              are intolerable, and it does
              not better the case, whether they be thus mutinous and
              troublesome out of their own folly and giddiness, or the
            
            
            
            suggestions
              and perswasions
              of others.

          <p n="3">
            3. The <hi>Dean</hi> adds,
              <hi>that to prevent these inconveniencies
              many Bishops
              were
              appointed
              without the choice of the people, and
              Canons
              were
              made
              for the regulation of Elections.</hi>
              To this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers,
              <hi>Craftily
              said!</hi>
              So men
              of craft are apt to suspect plain honest
              men;
              but wherein is
              this craft? Why, <hi>he saith
              not [without the consent of the people] but [the
              election]</hi> but whatever distinction
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may make between these, the <hi>Dean</hi>
              means
              honestly,
              nothing more (suppose) than a Negative Voice, that there can
              be no election without them.
              <hi>And he saith
              not, that the Canons
              took
              away either consenting
              or electing
              suffrages,
              but that they regulated
              them,
              yes they over and over confirmed
              them.</hi>
              Sometimes
              they did
              one, and
            
            sometimes
              t'other, which is
              an
              argument
              against an
              Inherent and unalterable
              right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <hi>D.</hi> instances
              in the election at <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the twelve
              Presbyters,
              to which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers,
              1. <hi>Does
              the Dr. think that the Presbyters
              choice excludeth
              the peoples?</hi>
              Not alwayes,
              but it is
              plain it did
              in this case, as all men
              know, who know the story; and he
            
            
            offers
              nothing to prove, that it did
              not. 2. <hi>Will he conclude, that whenever the History
              nameth
              not the peoples
              choice, it is
              left out?</hi> When it is
              named
              as a particular custome,
              peculiar to one Church, there is
              reason to think so. 3. <hi>Will he
              perswade
              us, that when the people are not the
              chusers,
              they are not necessarily
              the consenters
              or refusers?</hi>
              Yes, they are bound
              by the custome
              of their Church to be the consenters,
              but not refusers:
              and so they ought to be at this day, to acquiesce in the
              method of
              elections
              confirmed
              and established
              by the Laws
              of our Church.
          </p>
          <p>What he sayes
            of the tumults
            of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in after
            dayes,
            is
            owing
            to the change of this custome;
            for there were
            no tumults
            at elections
            before, which is
            a plain demonstration of the difference between
            limited
            and popular
            elections,
            though their souls
            were
            as well taken
            care of before without such tumults.</p>
          <p>
            As for the Ordination of <hi>Germanion</hi> and
              <hi>Gordius</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
              ordained
              by the Bishops
              in the place of <hi>Narcissus</hi> without any mention of
              the peoples
              consent; he answers,
              this is
              no argument that because the peoples
              consent is
              not
            
            
            
            mentioned,
              therefore they did
              not give their consent; but I think it a good argument, when
              <hi>Eusebius</hi> uses
              to be so punctual in giving
              an
              account of the manner of Elections;
              never leaving
              out the people, when there was
              reason to put
              them
              in. But how do the words
              of <hi>Eusebius</hi> confute this, when he
              sayes,
              <hi>that when</hi> Narcissus <hi>shewed
              himself again, the Brethren (no doubt the Laity,</hi> but
              any man who will doubt, may with the same reason Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> doubts
              of other things,
              who will believe nothing against
              him
              less than a Mathematical demonstration)
              <hi>intreated
              him
              to enjoy his Bishoprick
              again?</hi> What is
              this to the election of the former
              Bishops
              without their consent?
              If it were
              on Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s side, he would think it a good argument,
              that they did
              not chuse
              their former Bishops,
              because they were
              so willing to receive their old Bishop again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next instances
              are of several Bishops,
              who sensible of the great inconveniencies
              of these popular elections
              appointed
              their Successors
              in their life time; as <hi>Severus</hi> Bishop of
              <hi>Milevis,</hi> St. <hi>Austin, Paulus</hi> the
              <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishop at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> All
              that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers
            
            
            is,
              that it hence appears,
              that the people had
              the election; because St. <hi>Austin</hi>
              was
              desired
              to go to <hi>Milevis</hi> to perswade
              the people to accept their Bishop, and he himself in his
              life time, as being
              deservedly
              in great esteem among his people,
              perswades
              them
              to accept of a Bishop of his nominating;
              which was
              much the same case with <hi>Paulus</hi> the
              <hi>Novatian,</hi> whose Presbyters
              desired
              him
              to nominate his Successor for fear they should not agree. I
              grant what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes,
              that this does
              prove, that <hi>de facto</hi> the
              people at that
              time did
              chuse
              their Bishops,
              but it proves
              a little more, that wise men
              were
              sensible of the inconveniency
              of it, and took
              the best course they could to prevent it; which
              supposes,
              that they thought it a custom which might be very well
              parted
              with, and not essential to a Pastoral relation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes,
              that the Canon
            
            of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi>
              alledged
              by the <hi>Dean, that if one be
              ordained
              Bishop, and go not to the Parish</hi> (as he
              translates
              it) <hi>because the people refuse
              him,
              he shall have the honour and office of a
              Bishop, not
              troubling
              the peace of the Church,</hi>
            
            
            
            makes
              against him,
              as proving
              that the people had
              then the power of chusing
              or refusing:
              but on the other hand, it makes
              for the <hi>Dean,</hi> by proving,
              that the Bishops
              of those dayes,
              did
              not think it an
              Inherent right in the people
              to do either, for then they would not have
              ordained
              one for them
              without their
              consent. The same answer will serve for what
              is
              objected
              against St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s consecration of
              <hi>Euphronius</hi> without the consent of the people. But
              his answer to the Law of <hi>Justinian,</hi> which
              excluded
              the common people from the election of
              Bishops,
              is
              very pleasant; <hi>that this rather
              proves
              the peoples
              power, that so long after by an
              Emperour
              the poorer
              sort were
              restrained;</hi>
              it proves
              indeed <hi>de facto,</hi> that it
              was
              so, but the restraining
              of this power proves
              that it was
              not thought inherent
              and unalterable; and when Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              returned
              such answers
              as these, and took
              it in so much scorn, that the <hi>Dean</hi> should help
              him
              with more Citations
              to prove his cause, certainly
              he had
              quite forgot
              what the <hi>D.</hi> undertook
              to prove, not that the people never
              did
              chuse
              their Bishops,
              but that wise Bishops,
              Councils
              and Princes,
              were
              sensible
            
            
            of the mischief and danger of it, and by
              degrees
              endeavoured
              to restrain or regulate it.
          </p>
          <p>His answer to the <hi>Canon of Laodicea,</hi> which as the
            <hi>D.</hi> observed,
            <hi>excluded
            the common people from chusing
            any into the Clergy,</hi> savours
            of a desperate cause, for he is
            fore't to pervert the Canon by a false translation, and make
            nonsense of it
            into the bargain to get rid of it: He
            tells
            us <hi>Crab</hi> translates
            it thus, <hi>quod non sit permittendum turbis</hi>
            ( in the Greek) <hi>electiones eorum
            facere, qui sunt ad sacerdotium
            provehendi:</hi>
            the English is
            this, <hi>that it must not be allowed
            to the multitude to chuse
            into the Clergy:</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            translates
            it, <hi>it is
            not sufferable to chuse
            by tumults.</hi>
            Which is
            an
            admirable Decree for a Council; and
            an
            argument of the great skill or honesty of a
            Translator.</p>
          <p>
            The <hi>D.</hi> alledges,
              <hi>that the second</hi> Nicene
              <hi>Council,</hi> Can. 3. <hi>restrained
              the election
              only to Bishops,
              which was
              consirmed by following
              Councils
              in the Greek Church:</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot deny the
              thing, but finds
              something in it, which unchurches
              the Church of <hi>England: that if any Bishop use the
              Secular Magistrate to
            
            
            
            obtain by them
              a Church, let him
              be deposed
              and separated,
              and all that communicate
              with him.</hi>
              How Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has
              translated
              it I cannot tell, because I have not that Council by me; but
              the sense of it is
              sufficiently
              plain, that no man must perswade
              a Prince by force and power to make
              him
              Bishop, which
              we know was
              often the case, but we cannot suppose that Council to deny
              the Emperour
              his consent and approbation, nay,
              nomination
              of a fit person, any more than other
              Councils
              do the people, which yet forbid a Bishop to seek that Sacred
              Office by Votes,
              that is,
              to endeavour to perswade
              people to give their Votes
              for him;
              as the <hi>Orleance</hi>
              Council does,
            
            as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself relates
              it: and thus the Church of <hi>England</hi>
              is
              safe, though her Bishops
              are advanced
              by the Kings
              favour and nomination, granted
              by the Laws
              of Church and State, which are of
              greater
              authority with us in all alterable
              Constitutions,
              than much better Councils,
              than the second of <hi>Nice.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is
              sufficient to give a tast
              of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s way of answering
              the Dean, his other answers
              are very like it;
            
            
            and many of them
              have already been
              considered
              upon other occasions.
          </p>
          <p>Having
            thus considered,
            what the peoples
            right is
            in chusing
            their Pastors,
            there is
            but one inquiry more behind;</p>

            III. Whether there be any cases
              wherein the people may insist on a right of choice; for Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> loves
              to confound what is
              ordinary and common
              with what is
              extraordinary, and to make the same rule for both, as I have
              already observed;
              and thus he does
              here. He puts
              a great many hard cases,
              as suppose a Prince be a Papist, a Pagan, a Mahometan;
              suppose he
              chuse
              Atheists
              and Infidels
              and notorious Hereticks,
              or Ideots
              for our Pastors,
              and we can have no other
              but such, must we be contented
              with such Pastors
              as these, may not any Prince at this rate
              quickly
              destroy all
              Religion, and set up what he will in the room of it? I
              Answer, when the case is
              really
              thus, in Gods
              name let the people chuse
              better for themselves, and maintain the honour and interest
              of Religion and take care of their
              souls,
              whoever sayes
              nay;
            
            
            
            and if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks,
              that this is
              the present state of things,
              I think their separation is
              very innocent and commendable,
              and nothing but what becomes
              good Christians.
              Let him
              speak out, we desire no favour, he
              sees
              our Articles,
              our Liturgy, which whatever
              he thinks
              of us, we heartily
              subscribe,
              and assent and consent to; if this be Popery or Mahometism,
              let him
              but tell us, what Christianity is,
              and we will be his Converts;
              but in the mean time let him
              consider, what guilt he contracts
              by perswading
              ignorant and
              unstable people into a sinful
              separation by such arguments,
              as can never justifie
              men
              under a Protestant
              Prince, and in a Christian Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            But suppose we have such Pastors
              set over us as are under a great
              suspicion of
              concealed
              Heresie,
              which cannot be
              proved;
              Can concealed
              Heresie
              do people any mischief? For whatever
              he be, he cannot propagate his infection, while he
              keeps
              it to himself.
              And it is
              a mighty fault for people
              to suspect their Pastors
              of Heresie,
              when there is
              not sufficient evidence for it: but this indeed
              is
              not the fault
            
            
            of the people, but of their Teachers,
              who to secure them
              in a faction, paint Conformists
              in horrid and frightful shapes,
              to deter their Converts
              from any thoughts
              of returning
              to their Communion.
          </p>
          <p>
            But suppose some Conforming
              Ministers
              be horribly
              vicious and prophane:
              I hope there are few (whatever
              faults
              they may have) deserve this character. If there be any such
              vile wretches,
              who are a reproach to their Function and to Religion, all
              legal
              courses
              ought to be used
              for their removal, which must certainly
              be effectual,
              if they be so notoriously
              wicked; or if
              they be not removed,
              yet it is
              no just occasion for Schism and Separation, while religious
              Offices,
              and the administration of Sacraments
              are performed
              according
              to the appointment
              of the Church; and serious
              Christians
              have so many other helps
              for their souls,
              as I have already
              proved.
              St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I confess,
              did
              think any notorious crime a sufficient reason to forsake the
              communion of such a Bishop, but this
              was
              anciently
              thought as great a mistake in him,
              as his rebaptization of Hereticks;
            
            
            
            and St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his disputes
              against the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
              and I think the most learned
              Divines
              of all Communions
              for several ages
              have condemned
              it: However when this infection
              is
              not general, as our greatest
              enemies
              cannot say it is
              at this day, it is
              more excusable
              to withdraw from the Communion
              of a Parochial Minister, upon such
              accounts,
              and to joyn
              with neighbour
              Parishes,
              which are better supplied,
              than to forsake the Communion
              of the Church; which can never be lawful till absolute and
              unavoidable necessity justifie
              it.

          <p>
            OUR next Inquiry is
              concerning
              a National Church. I have already
              vindicated
              the constitution of National Churches,
              as founded
              on a Divine Law of Catholick
              Unity, which does
              not only justifie,
              but require
              such union and combination of Churches,
              as is
              for the preservation of order and unity, and the better
              edification and government of the Church. But since
              Church-Unity consists
              in one communion, it is
              necessary to
              explain more particularly,
              what that communion is,
              which is
              essential to
              a National Church, considered
              as a Church. Now to state this matter as
              clearly
              as I can, to lay a foundation for a plain answer to Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi>'s question, <hi>What the Church of</hi> England
              <hi>is,</hi>
              and <hi>who is
              the constitutive
            
            
            
            Regent head of it;</hi> I shall distinguish between a
              National Church considered
              as a Church, and as a Church incorporated
              with the State, and speak distinctly
              to each of them.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. Let us consider a National Church as a Church, or a
              Religious Society, for so I must profess, as the Dean
              did,
              <hi>I do believe there were
              Christian</hi>
            
            <hi>Churches
              before Christian Princes,
              that there are Christian Churches
              under Christian Princes,
              and will be such, if there were
              none left;</hi> nay I add farther,
              that there were
              and may be still, National Churches,
              when the Prince and great numbers
              of the people are not Christians.
              For Patriarchal and Metropolitan
              combinations
              of Churches
              are of the same nature with what we call National
              Churches,
              and such there were
              in the times
              of Paganism under Heathen and Persecuting
              Emperours.
              Now here are two things
              to be distinctly
              stated.
              1. What kind of Church a National Church
              is.
              2. What Communion is
              essential to it, considered
              as a Church.
          </p>
          <p n="1">
            1. What kind of Church a National
              Church is:
              and here I shall examine
              two questions,
              1. Whether it be
            
            
            properly
              called
              a Church. _2.
              Whether it be a
              Political Body.
          </p>
          <p>
            (1.) Whether a National Church be
              properly
              called
              a Church. For the Author <hi>of the Peaceable Design</hi> in
              his answer to the Dean, sayes,
              <hi>That to be</hi>
            
            <hi>particular or universal is
              of essential consideration
              to Christs Church, but to be national
              is
              of accidental consideration:</hi> and his reason for it
              is
              this: <hi>That all the people of the Land should be
              Christian,
              and the Magistrate also is
              (I say) an
              accidental thing to the Church, which may exist where that
              is
              not:</hi> and hence he infers;
              <hi>upon which account though the Magistrate be none of
              Christs proper Officers,
              yet may he be head of his Church, and constitutive Head of
              it, as under his dominions,
              because he is
              Head not in any essential, but in this accidental
              consideration
              of it:</hi> so that if this Author say true, the National
              Church is
              not a proper essential, but an
              accidental Church: for I suppose that
              is
              the meaning
              of its
              <hi>not being
              a Church in an
              essential, but accidental consideration,</hi> and thus my
              distinction between a National Church
              considered
              as a Church, and as incorporated
              into the state is
              out of doors;
              for it is
              a
            
            
            
            Church only as it is
              the state, and headed
              by the Civil Magistrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there are two things
              supposed
              in his argument as necessary to the
              being
              of a national Church, neither of which are necessary, 1.
              That all the people of the Nation should be
              Christians,
              and 2. That the King or national
              government should be so also: and then there could be
              nothing like a National Church for three hundred
              years
              and more, till <hi>Constantine</hi>
              embraced
              Christianity; and yet it is
              evident to any
              man, who is
              not so fond of beating
              out notions,
              that he can be contented
              to take a little book-learning
              with him,
              that there were
              many great combinations
              of Churches,
              which made
              up one body, and used
              to meet in Synods
              and Councils
              together to advise
              about the publick
              affairs
              of the Church and of Religion, long before those
              times;
              and these I take to be equivalent to a National Church,
              which I take to be the union of all the Christian
              Churches
              in a Nation into
              one Body and Society. And why this should be
              called
              an
              accidental consideration
              of the Christian Church, any more than the Universal Church
              it self
            
            
            is;
              I cannot tell. Our Saviour gave
              command to his Apostles
              to go teach all Nations,
              and plant Churches
              in them,
              and therefore this was
              the intention
              of our Saviour, that there should be
              Churches
              in all Nations,
              as well as in all the World: And if all the
              Churches
              in the World must make but one Church, then
              certainly
              much more must all the Churches
              in the same Nation be but one, which are in a
              nearer
              capacity of communion with each other, than the
              Churches
              of all the World are; and whereby
              Catholick
              unity and communion may be more
              easily
              preserved,
              than if all the particular Churches
              in a Nation were
              single and Independent; there being
              a more easie
              correspondence between Nations,
              than between every particular
              Town and City in distant Nations.
              But I have already discours'_
              these things
              more at large in vindication of National
              Churches.

            2. Another question is,
              Whether a National Church be a Political body, the right
              stating
              of which, will go far to put an
              end to this dispute. Thus
            
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells
              us, <hi>that the question is
              about Church Policy, or a Political form, not
            
            
            
            of a meer
              community of Christians:</hi>
              for the question Mr. <hi>B.</hi>

              <hi>What is
              the constitutive Regent head of the Church of</hi> England:
              <hi>that they may know what the National Church of</hi>
              England
              <hi>is,
              which they must obey, and from which they are
              said
              to separate?</hi> To this the <hi>Dean</hi>
              answers
              in my poor opinion with great judgement and
              consideration:
              <hi>We deny any necessity of such a
              Constitutive
              Regent part, or one formal</hi>
            
            <hi>Ecclesiastical Head as essential to a
              National
              Church.</hi> Here the Author of the <hi>Peaceable
              Design</hi> very modestly
              and civilly
              triumphs,
              <hi>If ever any Boy in the higher
              form at School, was
              posed
              by his Master, the Doctor here is
              posed,
              who is
              indeed in Mr.</hi> B.'s <hi>hands,
              no other than</hi>
            
            <hi>such a one, when he takes
              him
              in such a point, where his Books
              and polite style do not serve him.</hi>
              This I consess
              is
              plain dealing;
              and as an
              honest Countrey
            
            <hi>Conformist</hi> sayes,
              <hi>The Author is
              no Courtly Writer, he doth not powder nor dress his
              discourses;
              he writes neither with Oy_
              nor Gall, but with plain Vulgar Ink, what he
              thinks
              he speaks
              openly
              and honestly
              without any respect of Persons.</hi>
              I confess this Ink, which I see they both make use of,
              is
              grown
              too common,
            
            
            and any but those who use it, would think it
              had
              some mixture of Gall in it: and our
              Countrey
              <hi>Conformist</hi>
              is
              the general Apologist for this Ink, whose Pamphlet of
              Reflections
              consists
              of nothing else, but a Vindication
              of the most clownish and scurrilous
              abuses
              offered
              to a most excellent
              Person, to whom
              common Christianity,
              the Protestant Cause, and the Church of <hi>England</hi>
              owes
              more for his admirable Writings,
              than to most men
              in this Age. But this is
              the way of such little creatures
              to bark and snarl at those glorious
              Lights,
              which shine in a superiour
              Orb, as the objects
              of their envy, but above their spite and malice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I confess, takes
              an
              admirable way to answer this; for he
              states
              the question about <hi>the Political form of a Church,</hi>
              and then makes
              it essential to such a Political Church to have a <hi>pars
              regens,</hi> and <hi>pars subdita,</hi> a
              governing
              and governed
              part, and so as he thinks
              to have <hi>a constitutive regent head.
              Many
              Churches
              associated
              for mutual help and concord is
              a Church only in a loose sense:</hi> but <hi>those that are
              constituted
              of</hi>
            
            <hi>one Regent and a subdite part are
              called
              Churches
              in a Political proper sense.</hi>
            
            
            
            And that <hi>there is
              no Governour,
              where there is
              no supream
              in his place and kind.---It's no body political without one
              common Governour,
              Natural or Collective,</hi>
            
            <hi>Monarchical, Aristocratical,
              Democratical.</hi>
              But may not we say, <hi>that all the Bishps are
              Governours,
              and all together
              govern the whole?</hi> He answers,
              <hi>Tes</hi> per partes,
              <hi>but not as a whole or Church---unless your
              Bishops
              are united
              in one</hi> Persona Politica <hi>or
              Aristocracy,
              they may rule their several Churches,
              but they make not one common Government
              for the National Church as such.</hi> Herein his whole
              strength consists,
              by stating
              the question about a Political Church form, and then
              taking
              it for granted,
              that every Political body must have a Constitutive Regent
              head: But now if we deny this, that though a National Church
              be one body, yet it is
              not such a Political body as he
              describes,
              and cannot be according
              to its
              Original Constitution,
              which differs
              from Secular forms
              of Government, by that ancient Church Canon of our
              Saviours
              own decreeing,
              <hi>it shall not be so among you,</hi> the
              controversie
              were
              at an
              end, and a national Church as governed
              by consent
            
            
            may be one body in an
              ecclesiastical,
              though not in a civil political sense.

            The Author of the <hi>Peaceable
              Design</hi> in
              his Answer, sings
              over the same Song, <hi>That there
              is
              a government in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>I hope the
              Dr. does
              not doubt:</hi> No Sir, I will venture to grant this for
              him.
              <hi>Where there is</hi>
            
            <hi>a government established,
              there must be a Political Society;</hi> here this Author
              wants
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 's subtilty:
              if Government
              makes
              a Political Society, we grant a National Church
              is
              a Political Society, for government by consent, without
              superiority, is
              government. But he adds,
              <hi>every political body consists
              of a</hi> pars imperans <hi>and</hi> subdita: this I grant
              too, Church-governours
              united
              and governing
              by consent, are the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> Christian people
              in obedience
              to the Laws
              of our Saviour, submitting
              to such government are the <hi>pars subdita;</hi> and all
              this is
              true without a constitutive Regent Head. And that this
              is
              all that is
              or can be required
              to make a National Church one, considered
              as a Church, I prove by these two
              arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, that the entire notion of Church-unity
              consists
              in one communion,
            
            
            
            this is
              the unity of a particular, national, and universal Church,
              as I have already proved;
              the whole power of Church officers
              consists
              in taking
              in, or putting
              out of the Church: and therefore a Church society, as such,
              differs
              from a civil-political-body, armed
              with civil power and juridiction.
          </p>
          <p>Now consent is
            all that can be necessary
            to unite a body or society in one communion, for a body that
            subsists,
            and is
            one by consent, has
            all things
            necessary to unity and communion
            in a joynt
            consent: this consent indeed is
            not an
            arbitrary thing, but is
            made
            necessary by a divine law, and if we
            enquire
            after that superiour
            power, which unites
            all these Church-Governours
            in one consent, and keeps
            them
            together, so Christ is
            the constitutive
            Regent Head of the National, as well as Universal Church: for
            it is
            by his Authority, and as they are all accountable to
            him,
            that they unite into one body; and govern their several
            Churches
            by mutual consent, advice and counsel; but yet their
            unity
            consists
            only in consent, not in any
            Superiour-Governing-Ecclesiastical power on earth, which
            binds
            them
            together.
            For,</p>
          
          
          <p>
            Secondly,
              Christ hath
              instituted
              no such constitutive regent power of one Bishop over another
              in his Church; and therefore the union of particular
              Churches
              into one must be made
              by consent, not by superiority of power: The
              Apostles
              were
              all invested
              by Christ with equal power and authority,
              as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells
              us, <hi>that all the other Apostles
              were,
              what</hi> Peter <hi>was,
              equal</hi>
            
            <hi>sharers
              with him
              in honour and
              power, and that Christ gave
              all his Apostles
              equal power after his resurrection.</hi> And as the Ancient
              Fathers
              always
              asserted
              Bishops
              to be the Apostles
              successors,
              so they did
              as constantly
              affirm all Bishops
              to be equal: it is
              a known
              saying
              of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that <hi>whereever
              the Bishop be, at</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Eugubium,
            
            <hi>or</hi> Constantinople, <hi>c. he
              is
              of equal merit, and of the same Priesthood:</hi> and
              therefore as I shewed
              above, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              asserts,
              that there is
              but <hi>one Episcopacy</hi>
              (as there is
              but one Altar in the whole Church) of which every
              Bishop
              has
              an
              equal portion:
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three or four things
              very
            
            
            
            evident in Antiquity, as I have
              already
              sufficiently
              proved,
              which plainly
              shew,
              both that several particular Churches
              may and ought to unite in one body, and that such a body can
              be governed
              only by a mutual consent
              of the Bishops
              of those particular Churches,
              which are thus united
              into one: As (1.) the obligations
              to Catholick
              communion, as I have before observed,
              is
              the foundation of this union. (2.) Every particular Bishop
              is
              the supreme Governour
              in his own Diocess:
              (3.) That yet every Bishop
              has
              a relation to the whole Christian
              Church, and concerned
              as far as he can to take care of the whole,
              especially
              of neighbouring
              Churches,
              which are under his eye, and nearer
              inspection: and therefore (4.) That those
              Bishops,
              especially
              whose vicinity
              and neighbourhood makes
              them
              capable of such a union, should
              govern their
              Churches
              by mutual advice
              and counsel, and observe the same
              laws
              and rules
              of worship, discipline, and government; and when Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> can give me any reason, why this may not be
              called
              one Church, one Ecclesiastical-body-Politick,
              without a constitutive
            
            
            Regent Head, I'll think further
              of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            All that I can find he says
              to this is,
              that this is
              not one government of the Church
              considered
              as National, <hi>it is</hi>
            
            <hi>not one Church but an
              association of many Churches,
              such as a thousand Independent Churches
              may make, or the Churches
              of many Kingdoms.</hi>
              I answer, 1. I can see no reason, why that may not be
              called
              one government, which is
              concluded
              by common advice, counsel, and consent, though
              administred
              by particular Bishops
              in their own Diocess:
              for in this case every Bishop governs
              his Diocess
              by common consent,
              and is
              accountable to his associated
              Bishops
              for male-administration. 2. As for Independent
              Churches
              they can never be thus united,
              because though indeed they may consent if they please, yet
              they may not also, if they please, they
              being
              according
              to their fundamental principles
              and original
              constitution absolute and independent;
              and therefore may stand by themselves if they please: but
              now we assert, that all Bishops
              according
              to the standing
              laws
              of Catholick
              unity and
              communion ought thus to associate
            
            
            
            by mutual consent, and that those are
              Schismaticks
              not Catholick
              Bishops,
              who do not: and this is
              the constitution, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              enquires
              after, which we have, and which the
              Independents
              have not, for if they had,
              they were
              no longer
              Independents,
              but like Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Parochial
              Bishops.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. We assert no other difference
              between a
              National consent and association
              of Churches,
              and the association of the Churches
              of many Kingdoms,
              or the universal Church; but only in the different
              degrees
              of communion, which are owing
              to neighbourhood, their living
              in one nation, and under one civil government. The
              Churches
              of the same Nation, under the same Prince, may more
              advantageously
              unite in the same rules
              of worship and discipline, whose civil
              customs,
              and manners,
              and way of life are the same, which very much influence
              Ecclesiastical
              constitutions;
              whose Bishops
              upon any emergent occasions
              may more conveniently
              meet together for advice and counsel, and where
              appeals
              may be heard
              and determined
              with least trouble; where both Bishops
              and people
            
            
            do more frequently
              converse with each others, and joyn
              in the publick
              offices
              of religion: these are nearer
              acts
              of Christian communion, than we can enjoy with the
              Churches
              of foreign nations,
              whose civil laws
              and customs
              differ, and whose Princes
              possibly
              do not well agree, and whose distance will not admit of such
              a <hi>presential
              communion,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              speaks)
              as is
              required
              to such association of Churches;
              but could this be done
              in several Kingdoms,
              nay, in all the world as conveniently
              as in one Nation,
              I should think there were
              no need of such National associations.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now I think I have fairly
              prepared
              the way to justifie
              that answer the <hi>Dean</hi> gave
              to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s inquiry, what
              is
              the constituent Regent Head of the Church of
              <hi>England:</hi> to which he answers
              two things,
              1. <hi>That it proceeds</hi>
            
            <hi>upon a false supposition, which
              is,
              that whereever
              there is
              the true notion of a Church, there must be a constitutive
              Regent part, that is,
              there must be a standing
              governing
              power, which is
              an
              essential part of it.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              replies,
              1. by excepting
              against that phrase of
            
            <hi>the true notion of a Church,</hi> and would
            
            
            
            have the <hi>Dean</hi> put in the political
              notion; which
              had
              been
              wise work, when the <hi>Dean</hi>
              denies
              such a political
              governing
              power as he asserts,
              but of this above: and therefore the true notion of a Church
              was
              the properest
              term the <hi>D.</hi> could use, for it
              was
              evident to
              every man, what Church he spoke
              of, not such equivocal Churches,
              as <hi>a Ship full, or Prison full, or House full of
              Christians.</hi>
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. He asks,
            <hi>is
            not government essential to a governed
            Church?</hi> and does
            the <hi>D.</hi> deny this? is
            not government by consent a government?
            is
            there no government, but where there
            is
            <hi>a constitutive
            regent Head?</hi> let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> prove this.</p>
          <p>
            The <hi>Dean</hi> proves
              there is
              no need of a constitutive Regent part to make a
            
            Church from Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s own
              concession,
              <hi>that there is
              one Catholick
              visible Church, and that all particular
              Churches,
              as headed
              by their particular Bishops
              or Pastors,
              are parts
              of the universal Church. Now if this doctrine be true, and
              withal it be
              necessary, that every Church must have a constitutive Regent
              part as essential
              to it, then it unavoidably
              follows,
              that there must be a Catholick
              visible
            
            
            Head to the Catholick
              visible Church, and so Mr.</hi> B.'<hi>s constitutive Regent
              part of a Church hath
              done
              the Pope a wonderful kindness, and
              made
              a very plausible
              plea for his universal Pastorship.</hi>
              The <hi>D.</hi> indeed owns,
              <hi>that Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>says,
              that the universal Church is
              headed
              by Christ himself,</hi> but adds,
              <hi>that this doth not remove the
              difficulty;
              for the question is
              about that visible Church, whereof the particular
              Churches
              are parts,
              and they being
              visible parts
              do require a visible constitutive Regent head as essential
              to them;
              therefore the
              whole visible Church must have likewise a visible
              constitutive Regent part,</hi> i. e. <hi>a visible head of
              the Church.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his flattering
              Eccho
              very wisely
              start aside from the main argument (as
              being
              at an
              irrecoverable
              loss) to pursue at fresh game: and they found a very fair
              opportunity
              for it, from the dispute of the
              necessity of
              a visible head to the visible Catholick
              Church. The Author of the peaceable design,
              thinks
              <hi>it enough</hi>
            
            <hi>that Christ is
              the head of those who are visible:</hi> But yet
              disputes
              very learnedly,
              that Christ is
              the visible head of his Church: because he
              was
              visible
            
            
            
            when he was
              on earth, and is
              now visible in Heaven. Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              is
              much concerned,
              that after he has
              written
              so much against <hi>Johnson</hi> the Papist about the
              Visible Head, the <hi>Dean</hi>
              charges
              him
              with such principles,
              as will in the issue justifie
              the Popes
              claim to the Catholick
              Visible Pastorship: and to be even with
              him,
              he trys to make him
              a Papist, and crys
              out, <hi>Is
              this our Champion against Popery now?</hi>
            
            and thus this matter is
              pretty well adjusted.
              But he thinks
              it no inconvenience,
              that there should be an
              invisible
              Head to a visible Body, for so God who
              is
              invisible is,
              what? the invisible Head of all the
              Kingdoms
              of the world? that he would not say, <hi>but all the
              Kingdoms
              of the world are visible parts
              of his universal Kingdom, though he be invisible,</hi> which
              is
              nothing to the purpose: but however,
              no man dares
              deny that Christ is
              the universal Head of his Church: that we grant, but not the
              Visible Head: and we are far from
              asserting
              <hi>that the universal Head must be visible if the
              subordinate be so:</hi> but this we assert, that if no
              Church can be a true visible Church without a
              subordinate
            
            
            visible Head, then the universal
              Church cannot be a visible Church without a subordinate
              Catholick
              visible Head,
              no more than a National Church can: But he
              says,
              <hi>this is
              to turn the controversie
              from the necessity of a Regent Head, to the necessity of his
              visibility:</hi> This I deny, for when the question
              is
              about a constitutive Regent
              Head on earth, it concerns
              a visible Head on earth: for if
              an
              invisible
              Head in Heaven would end the controversie,
              we could find him
              the same Regent Head for a national, as he
              has
              done
              for the universal Church: for I hope Christ
              is
              Head of every part of his Church as well as of the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true state of the question after all this pother
              is
              this: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> attempts
              to prove, that a national Church
              cannot be one
              political Church, unless it have a constitutive Regent Head;
              does
              he mean this of a visible Head on earth, or not: if not,
              then as I now observed,
              we can soon end this controversie,
              by asserting
              Christ to be the Head of the national Church, and let
              him
              disprove it if he can: if he does
              mean it of a visible Head on
            
            
            
            earth, then how does
              he answer the <hi>Dean</hi>'s argument, that if no Church
              is
              a true Church, which has
              not a visible
              constitutive Regent Head on earth, who
              visibly
              governs
              the Church in subordination to Christ the invisible Head in
              Heaven: then the Catholick
              Church is
              not one true visible Church, unless he will find a visible
              Head for it, and this will be a great kindness to the Pope
              of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will then dispute his title with any
              new pretenders:
              this he has
              made
              no reply to, and I suspect, he understands
              very good reason for it.
          </p>
          <p>To what the <hi>Dean</hi> has
            thus unanswerably
            objected,
            I shall add but this one thing more; that to deny a Church can
            be one without a constitutive Regent
            Head, does
            necessarily
            infer a denial of one of these two
            things,
            either 1. that
            many particular Churches
            can combine and associate into one, for the
            joynt
            exercise of discipline and government, which
            overthrows
            the very notion of Catholick
            unity and communion, or 2. that there
            is
            and must be a power in the Church
            superiour
            to the Episcopal power, which naturally
            sets
            up a Pope above Bishops.</p>
          
          
          <p>
            It is
              evident from the Testimony of the
              earliest
              ages
              of the Church, that first the Apostles,
              and then the Bishops
              as their successors,
              were
              the supreme Governours
              of the Church, who had
              no higher
              order or power over them:
              and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi>
              calls
              the Bishop Summus Sacerdos, <hi>the chief or
              high_st</hi>
            
            <hi>Priest;</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> apices 
              principes, <hi>the tops
              and Princes
              of all,</hi> which was
              the general language of those days,
              as any one who pleases
              may learn from Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>'s
              learned
              <hi>Treat_se
              of</hi>
            
            <hi>the Popes
              Supremacy.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            And as Bishops
              were
              the highest
              Governours
              of the Church, so every Bishop was
              greatest
              in his own Diocess,
              no other Bishop, nor Synod of Bishops
              could impose any thing on him
              without his own consent: they met
              for advice and counsel, not for rule and empire, which Mr.
              <hi>B.</hi> tells
              us so often was
              Arch Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s judgement, and which
              plainly
              was
              the judgement and practice of Antiquity,
              as appears
              from what I have already discoursed
              about Catholick
              Communion: It were
              easie
              to transcribe
              several passages
              out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              to this purpose, especially
              his Preface
            
            
            
            to the Council of <hi>Carthage:</hi> where he
              tells
              them,
              <hi>that they were
              met
              freely
              to declare their opinions
              about this matter</hi>
              (the rebaptization of those who
              were
              baptized
              by Hereticks)
              <hi>judging
              no man, nor denying
              Communion to him,
              if he dissent; for neither doth any of us constitute himself
              Bishop of Bishops,
              or by Tyrannical terrour
              compel his Collegues
              to a necessity of obeying,
              since every Bishop
              being
              free, and in own power, has
              his own free choice, and can neither be
              judged
              by another, nor judge another: but let us all expect the
              judgement of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone
              has
              power both to advance us to the government of his Church,
              and judge of our government.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            It was
              not indeed a superiour
              power, but the
              obligation to Christian communion, which
              united
              them
              in one body; nor was
              it lawful to deny Christian communion for every
              different
              practice or opinion in matters
              of discipline, for which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              reproves
              <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in this very cause,
              and before him,
              <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Pope <hi>Victor</hi> about the Paschal
              controversie:
              But if any Bishop was
              notoriously
              Heretical, or guilty of any
            
            
            great vice, then they withdrew
              from his communion by publick
              consent and judgement, and ordained
              another in his room, and exhorted
              the people to forsake him;
              as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did
              in the case of <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis.</hi>
              And thus a Bishop may be deposed
              without any
              superiour
              authority over him,
              as a Bishop, as well as a private Christian be
              excommunicated:
              For the Church has
              certainly
              authority to
              cast all unworthy members
              out of its
              Communion, whether Clergy
              or Laity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor does
              this overthrow that very ancient constitution of Patriarchal
              or Metropolitan Churches:
              For a Patriarch
              or Metropolitan was
              not a superiour
              order to Bishops,
              nor included
              any authority over them,
              as is
              evident from what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              discoursed,
              who was
              himself a Primate, but only some precedency in the same
              order, and such advantages
              of power in the government
              of the Church, as was
              given
              them
              by the common consent of Bishops,
              for a greater
              publick
              good: as the power of calling
              Provincial Synods,
              and presiding
              in them,
              and a principal interest in the ordination of
            
            
            
            Bishops
              in his Province, and the like: which
              were
              determined
              and limited
              by Ecclesiastical Canons.
          </p>
          <p>It is
            true, this Patriarchal power did
            in time degenerate into domination and Empire, when it fell
            into the hands
            of ambitious men,
            but was
            originally
            (and is
            so still, when wise and good men
            have the management of it,) a very prudent constitution to
            preserve peace and order, and good discipline in the
            Church.</p>
          <p>
            But that Arch-Bishops
              and Metropolitans
              had
              no proper superiority and jurisdiction over
              Bishops
              is
              very evident
              from what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> objects
              against the discipline of the <hi>Montanists.
              Among us (i. e.</hi> the Catholicks)
              <hi>the</hi>
            
            <hi>Bishops
              enjoy the place of the Apostles,
              among them
              the Bishop is
              but the third: For they have the
              Patriarchs
              of</hi> Pepusa <hi>in</hi> Phrygia <hi>for the first, those
              whom
              they call</hi> Cenones <hi>for the second; thus
              Bishops
              are thrust down into the third, that
              is,
              almost the last place:</hi> and yet in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s
              time the Catholick
              Church had
              Arch-Bishops
              and Metropolitans,
              but it seems
              not such as degraded
              Bishops,
              or advanced
              any above them:
              And methinks
              this is
              an
              untoward
            
            
            testimony against Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Parochial
              Bishops,
              whom
              he calls
              the lowest
              Bishops,
              for Bishops
              were
              always
              the highest
              order in the Church.
          </p>
          <p n="2">2. The second thing the <hi>Dean</hi>
            answers,
            contains
            <hi>the resolution</hi> of the question, <hi>that we deny any
            necessity of any such constitutive Regent part, as one formal
            Ecclesiastical Head, as essential to a National Church: For a
            National consent is
            as sufficient to make a National
            Church, as an
            universal consent to make a Catholick
            Church.</hi> That this is
            the true resolution of the question
            has
            been
            sufficiently
            proved
            already; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> returns
            no new _nswer
            to it but this, <hi>No consent maketh
            a Catholick
            Church, but consenting
            to one Supreme Head Christ:</hi> then it
            seems
            the Catholick
            Church is
            one by no external visible bonds
            of union; but I have already proved,
            that the unity of the Catholick
            Church consists
            in its
            consent and agreement in one Communion; and thus a National
            Church as a larger
            portion of the universal Church
            is
            one also.</p>

            II. Having
              considered
              what kind of Church a National Church
              is,
              let us now consider, what acts
              of Christian
              Communion are essential to a National Church; and I need not
              add much to what has
              been
              already hinted
              for the explication of this matter. As,
          </p>
          <p n="1">1. That all the Churches
            in the Nation live
            in Communion with each other, and
            freely
            communicate together,
            as one and the s_me
            Church. And this answers
            Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Query, <hi>Why do you pretend, that we are
            none of the Church of</hi> England---<hi>who deny not
            associated
            Chur__es
            in</hi> England <hi>under one Civil Government:</hi> for
            whatever he means
            by this, it is
            plain they are not associated
            in one Communion with us, and therefore cannot make one
            Church, though they live under the same Civil Government: for
            separate Ecclesiastical Communions
            is
            a contradiction
            to the Notion and Being
            of One Church.</p>
          <p n="2">
            2. That they consent in the same Confession of Faith and
              Rules
              of Worship.
              Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> desires
              to know what this consent is,
              which is
              necessary
            
            
            to make us members
              of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> because there are a great
              many differences
              among our selves
              concerning
              the sense of many Articles,
              and the different manner of explaining
              them:
              Now to consent to the Doctrine of any Church,
              is
              to believe those Articles
              of Faith, which it proposes
              as its
              Doctrine: but then where the Church
              has
              not determined
              every minute question,
              but has
              left a latitude of sense to prevent
              Schisms
              and breaches
              upon every different opinion (as it
              is
              evident the
              Church of <hi>England</hi> has
              done
              in some Articles,
              which are most liable
              to the hottest
              disputes,
              which yet are penned
              with that temper, as to be willingly
              subscribed
              by men
              of different
              apprehensions
              in those matters)
              those who live in the same communion,
              and worship God together, are members
              of the same Church; which those who agree in the same Faith
              cannot be, who
              do not worship God in the same communion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot say it is
              absolutely
              necessary to
              the Constitution of a National Church, that all the
              particular Churches
              should have the same Liturgy and form of Worship, but
              certainly
              it is
            
            
            
            highly
              reasonable and convenient, that they should; and when it
              is
              so setled
              by mutual consent and advice, it
              is
              a degree of
              Schism for any Church to depart
              from the common rule.
          </p>
          <p n="3">
            3. National communion requires,
              that the National Church be governed
              by common advice and consent, or by common
              Rules
              and Canons
              agreed
              and confirmed
              by mutual advice: And this as the <hi>Dean</hi>
              observed
              is
              declared
              in Convocations,
              which consist of Arch-Bishops,
              Bishops
              and Presbyters.
              For as the ancient Government of
              particulas
              Churches
              was
              in the hands
              of Bishops,
              with the advice of their Council
              of Presbyters;
              so the Convocation for the Government of the National
              Church, by mutual consent consists
              of Bishops
              and their Presbyters;
              not indeed of
              all Presbyters,
              who could not be spared
              from their several Cures
              to meet in Convocation, but of such as are
              chosen
              by the inferiour
              Clergy for their Proxies:
              and such Ecclesiastical Canons
              or Rules
              of Discipline, agreed
              by mutual consent, though they have not the force of a Civil
              Law, till they are confirmed
              by Civil Authority, nor can bind a
              dissenting
              Bishop without
            
            
            the concurrence of some other obligation,
              yet do oblige the Consciences
              of those Christian people, whose
              Bishops
              receive and own them;
              for if Christians
              are bound
              to submit to the Government
              and Discipline of the Church as
              exercised
              by their Bishop, then much more, when their Bishop
              does
              not govern
              arbitrarily,
              but by fixed
              Rules
              agreed
              by the common advice and consent
              of the Bishops
              and Clergy of the National Church.
          </p>
          <p>And thus we have found a National Church, and Church
            Government antecedent
            to any humane authority; for as for that Objection, that the
            Church of <hi>England</hi> is
            not one, but two Provincial
            Churches,
            with their distinct Synods,
            it alters
            not the case, since both Provincial
            Synods
            act by mutual consent,
            which makes
            them
            one Church, as much as all the Churches
            of the same Province are one.</p>
          <p>
            So vain is
              it, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> insinuates,
              that we own <hi>no Government of the Church, but the
              Civil.</hi> And upon the same mistake,
              asks
              <hi>How old our Church is?
              what Parliament first made
              it? Does</hi>
            
            <hi>it dye,
              and live again, as oft as Parliaments
              change it? How shall we prove,
            
            
            
            that the whole or half of the Nation, ever
              meant
              to put their consent into the hand of the Parliament to make
              a new Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to alter it? What
              men
              make, they may destroy. May not the Nation withdraw such
              consent, and the Parliament unmake their
              creature?</hi>
              These I confess are all very smart
              Objections,
              had
              the <hi>Dean</hi> assigned
              no other original or being
              to the Church, but a National consent in Parliament, but if
              a National Church considered
              as a Church, be antecedent
              to any such consent in the nature of the thing, and
              does
              not depend upon
              such a National consent to be a Church, but only to be
              incorporated
              with the Civil Government, all these
              questions
              need no answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            A great many other questions
              he asks
              just to as much purpose as these, and
              proceeding
              upon the same mistake:
              as that the <hi>Dean</hi> has
              defended
              the Church of <hi>England</hi> fairly,
              by denying
              that <hi>there is
              any such Church in the questioned
              Political sense: that he</hi>
            
            <hi>absolves
              all men
              from the duty of obeying
              the Church of</hi> England <hi>as such; and how can
              men
              be Schismaticks
              for disobeying
              them
              that are not their Governours;</hi>
            
            
            with abundance more to the same Tune, all
              running
              upon this supposition,
              that the <hi>Dean</hi> owns
              no National Church, nor Church authority, but what
              is
              owing
              to Civil Authority, which appearing
              to be so wild a mistake,
              we will leave him
              to answer his questions
              himself, and now consider
              the National Church, as incorporated
              into the State.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            II. The Church considered
              as incorborated
              into the State continues
              the same Church still, only back't and
              countenanced
              by Civil Authority: No Prince, nor Parliament have
              authority to
              make a new Church, because
              they have no authority to alter Divine or Apostolical
              Institutions:
              And therefore those are admirable
              Notion
              makers,
              who would make a National
              Church of all the different forms
              of Churches
              <hi>by an
              Act of Parliament</hi>
            
            <hi>to le_itimate
              the meetings
              of</hi> Nonconformists,
              <hi>so as thereby to become immediately
              parts
              of the Church as National,
              no l_ss
              than the Parochial Assemblies.</hi>
              But this is
              the same man, who makes
              the Church as National, to be only of
              an
              accidental, not essential consideration,
            
            
            
            and truly
              I must confess this would be a kind of
              an
              accidental Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the only difference between a National Church
              considered
              as a Church, and as it is
              incorporated
              into the State is
              this, that as a Church it has
              no other authority, but what is
              purely
              Ecclesiastical, consisting
              in Church censures,
              as incorporated
              into the State it enjoyes
              Civil priviledges,
              and is
              armed
              with Civil power: the King is
              its
              Civil Political Head, and though he
              has
              no authority, which is
              purely
              Ecclesiastical,
              yet has
              authority over Ecclesiastical
              persons:
              Church Canons
              when confirmed
              by Civil Authority, become the Laws
              of the Land, as much as any other
              Laws
              are, and Church Censures
              are backed
              with Civil punishments
              upon obstinate dissenters.
              And in this sense the <hi>Dean</hi>
              understood
            
            a National Church, when he answers
              that question, <hi>how it comes
              to be one National
              Church:</hi> for he distinguishes
              this from another question, <hi>how all the
              Congregations
              in</hi> England <hi>make up this one Church;</hi> which he
              answers,
              <hi>I say by unity of consent, as all particular
              Churches
              make one Catholick
              Church.</hi> Where it is
              plain, he means
              the Church as a
            
            
            Church: and therefore by the National
              Church, he means
              the Church a_
              incorporated
              into the State, and so answers
              very truly,
              that it becomes
              a National
              Church, <hi>because it was
              received</hi>
            
            <hi>by the common consent of the whole
              Nation in
              Parliament, as other Laws
              of the Nation are.</hi> Which shews
              how impertinent
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s questions
              are upon this occasion; as <hi>what that common
              governing
              power in the Church is,
              which this Parliament consent hath
              set up:</hi> that the <hi>D.</hi>
              told
              him
              before, was
              by the consent
              of Churches,
              and I suppose he will ask that question no more: and <hi>if
              it be by Parliament consent, how old
              is
              your Church?</hi> as confirmed
              by Act of Parliament, it is
              no elder than the first confirmation of it; but otherwise
              much elder than Presbyterie,
              or Parochial
              Episcopacy. <hi>Doth it live and
              dye
              again as oft as Parliaments
              change it? May not the Parliament unmake their
              creatures?</hi>
              Yes they may, if they can alter
              an
              essential part of the Civil Government;
              they may deprive it of Civil
              authority, but it is
              a Church still. And as for his dispute, Whether a
              National
              consent be included
              in what the
            
            
            
            Parliament does
              in matters
              of Religion, neither the <hi>D.</hi> I think, nor any body
              else for him,
              is
              bound
              to defend it; if there be but as much National
              consent, as
              there is
              to any other Law, which was
              all the <hi>Dean</hi> asserted:
              for we do not say, that the Parliament
              makes
              our Church, but only makes
              the Government and Discipline of the Church, the Law of the
              Land: and when he asks,
              <hi>how Dissenters
              come to be bound
              by Parliament consent? if it never
              was
              in their minds,
              to trust them
              as consenters
              for them?</hi>
              I know no body
              asserts,
              that they are any otherwise bound,
              than they are by the other Parliamentary
              Laws;
              and if they think they are not bound
              by them,
              they may deliver themselves from the
              obligation
              of these, considered
              as Parliamentary
              Laws;
              and as for that dispute, whether <hi>the
              Laws
              bind them,
              only as consenting
              to them
              by their representatives,</hi>
              I do not see, how the <hi>D.</hi> nor the cause he
              defends,
              is
              concerned
              in it; the Church of <hi>England</hi>
              is
              made
              the Law of the Nation, by as much National consent, as any
              other Law has,
              and that is
              sufficient to our
            
            
            purpose. Thus he asks,
              <hi>if the peoples</hi>
            
            <hi>consent can make a National Church, why may it not make
              a Presbyterian, or Independent
              Church?</hi> but we say, the peoples
              consent makes
              neither, and an
              Act of Parliament may establish either by Law, though that
              Law cannot make them
              a Church, which must have a more Divine Institution. Thus
              <hi>if the Nations
              consent as such, make the Church of</hi> England, <hi>it
              is
              not made
              by Legislative power of King and
              Parliament:</hi>
              but therefore the <hi>D.</hi> speaks
              of no other National consent, but what
              is
              included
              in the Legislative power of King and Parliament, which
              does
              not make it a Church, but establish it by a Civil Sanction.
              <hi>Do the Church re+present
              the King, or is
              he none of the Church?</hi> As King he
              is
              the Civil Governour
              of the Church, as a private Christian, a member of it.
              <hi>How prove you, that the Clergy represent the Laity in
              the Convocation?</hi> Who sayes
              they do, or that there is
              any need they should? But <hi>by your rule, if
              divers
              parties
              of Christians
              agree to set up divers
              forms
              of Church Governments
              with mutual forbearance, they would be one
            
            
            
            National Church.</hi> That can never be, because mutual
              forbearance cannot make them
              one Communion, which is
              essential to a National Church. Thus
              easie
              is
              it to answer this man of many questions,
              when once the case is
              plainly
              stated,
              I think I have considered
              what is
              most popularly
              objected
              by him,
              and dare venture any ordinary Reader with the rest.

            is
            essential to the Catholick
            or Universal Church.</head>
          <p>HAving
            already discourst
            so largely
            of the communion of Diocesan
            and National Churches,
            I need not add much more about Catholick
            Communion, or the Communion of the Universal Church: that
            there is
            such a thing, which unites
            the whole Christian Church into one body, I have already
            proved
            at large, and therein
            given
            sufficient intimations,
            what this Catholick
            Communion is,
            and wherein it consists.</p>
          <p>
            I have already proved
              the Catholick
              Church to be one visible body and society, and therefore
              need not now add any thing more to confute that opinion,
              that the Catholick
              Church is
              invisible, which is
              asserted
              by Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi>
              and his Independent Brethren. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others
              who
            
            
            
            acknowledge one visible Catholick
              Church consisting
              of all the particular
              Churches
              of the world, do not much differ from Dr. <hi>O.</hi>'s
              invisible Church, while they make the unity of this Church
              to consist only in their union to Christ as Head of the
              Church, not in the union of Churches
              as members
              of the same body: for I take it not to be enough that all
              Churches
              are united
              to Christ, unless they be all united
              in one body; for the whole Church cannot be the one body of
              Christ, unless all particular Churches
              are one body: and therefore I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
              and his Brethren to tell us, how the whole
              Catholick
              Church is
              united
              into one body: I assert this is
              done
              by one communion; if he can tell any better way, I would
              gladly
              learn it; especially
              if he can tell me, how all Churches
              can be one body without one Communion. But to
              reduce all to as
              narrow a compass, as I can, I shall
              briefly
              discourse these two things.
              1. What that communion is,
              which makes
              the Catholick
              Church one body. 2. What place there can be for
              Catholick
              Communion, in such a broken
              and divided
              state of Christian
            
            
            Churches,
              as we see at this day.
          </p>
          <p n="1">I. What that Communion
            is,
            which makes
            the Catholick
            Church one body.
            And I shall not here insist on Catholick
            Doctrine or Catholick
            Charity, which
            are necessarily
            supposed
            as the foundations
            of Catholick
            Communion; but
            yet are not sufficient to make the Church one, when they do
            not unite all in one communion, as I have already
            proved:
            but Catholick
            Communion strictly
            so called,
            principally
            consists
            in two things;
            1. In the agreement and concord of the
            Bishops
            of the Catholick
            Church among themselves and with each other. 2. In the
            communion of particular Churches
            and Christians
            with one another.</p>
          <p n="1">
            1. In the concord and agreement of the
              Bishops
              of the Catholick
              Church with each other: for the
              Bishops
              being
              the supream
              Governors
              of their particular Churches,
              their agreement and consent is
              necessary to Catholick
              Communion. This is
              sufficiently
              evident from what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              affirms,
              that there is
              but one Episcopacy
              in the Christian Church, of
            
            
            
            which every Bishop has
              an
              equal share, and therefore that all the
              Bishops
              in the world are Collegues,
              and no man can have the authority or honour of a Bishop, who
              does
              not preserve the peace and unity of the Episcopacy, that
              is,
              who does
              not live in unity with his fellow
              Bishops.
              That the Catholick
              Church is
              one, when it is
              not rent and divided,
              but united
              and coupled
              by the cement of Bishops,
              who stick close together, as I have
              already
            
            discoursed
              at large.
          </p>
          <p>And hence it is
            evident, that a superior
            power over Bishops
            is
            not necessary
            to the unity of the Church, for no man
            does
            more plainly
            deny that, than St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            does,
            and yet no man is
            a more resolute asserter of Catholick
            Communion than he is.</p>
          <p>
            Now there were
              several wayes
              whereby this communion among Bishops
            
            was
              expressed
              and maintained.
              As, 1. By Writing
              Letters
              to, and receiving
              Letters
              from one another about Church affairs.
              Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            
            
            sends
              a catalogue of the names
              of Catholick
              Bishops
              to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop
              of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might know to
              whom
              to write, and from whom
              to receive Letters.
              For hereby they owned
              communion one with another, by owning
              those to whom
              they wrote
              to be their Collegues
              and Fellow-Bishops,
              which they never would do to Schismaticks.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            2. By advising
              together about the publick
              affairs
              of the Church, and communicating
              counsels
              with each other, and giving
              an
              account of the reasons
              of their actions,
              that there might be no mis-understanding
              between
              them:
              there are numerous instances
              of this in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
              Epistles.
              As to give some few: Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            
            writes to the Roman Clergy in the vacancy of that See,
              giving
              an
              account, why
              he denied
              communion to those who were
              lapsed,
              and yet challenged
              the Communion of the Church as granted
              them
              by <hi>Paul</hi> the Martyr.
              Thus he writes to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to
            
            acquaint him,
              that he disowned
              the Ordination of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> but
              owned
              his: <hi>Cornelius</hi> writes to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            
            about those Confessors,
              who at first
            
            
            
            joyned
              with <hi>Novatianus,</hi> but were
              now returned
              to the communion of the Church. And several other
              Letters
              past between them,
              about <hi>Novatianus</hi>
            
            and his Schism. Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              and other <hi>African</hi> Bishops
              sent
              a Synodical Epistle to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to give
              him
              an
              account of their reasons,
              why they had
              now yielded,
              contrary to their first determination, to receive the
              lapsed
              to communion, and the peace of the Church: as he
              afterwards
              did
              to <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
              concerning
            
            the decree of their Council to baptize
              those, who had
              been
              baptized
              by Hereticks.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            For though they did
              not own a superiority
              of power of any one Bishop, or Church over another, and
              therefore
              would not allow of judiciary appeals
              to a foreign Church, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
            
            speaks
              in his Epistle to <hi>Cornelius</hi>
              about <hi>F_licissimus</hi>
              and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi>
            
            
            two schismatical Presbyters
              of the Church of <hi>Carthage;</hi> yet they thought it the
              duty of every Bishop, and the most effectual way to preserve
              Catholick
              Communion, not only to govern
              their Churches
              with the advice and consent of neighbour
              Bishops
              of the same Province, but to consult with foreign
              Churches,
              especially
              in matters
              of such importance, as did
              equally
              concern all Churches.
              And therefore the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> after the death of
              <hi>Fabianus</hi> before they had
              a new Bishop ordained
              in his room, in that very Letter to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
              wherein they mightily
              commend his modesty in acquainting
              them
              with the affairs
              of his Church, and making
              them,
              not judges
              but partners
              of his counsels,
              yet acknowledge, that all such publick
              matters
              should be concluded
              by publick
              advice, and that no decree
              can be firm and lasting,
              which has
              not a general consent: and thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              had
              acknowledged
              in his
            
            Letter to them,
              that mutual love and charity, and the reason of the thing
              required,
              that he should not conceal any thing from their notice, but
              that
            
            
            
            they should advise with each other
              concerning
              the most profitable administration
              of Ecclesiastical Discipline.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus by communicating
              counsels
              with each other though they could not meet together in a
              General
              Council, yet they had
              the advice and consent of all Christian
              Churches
              in the world in all difficult affairs;
              Neighbour Bishops
              first advising
              with each other in provincial Synods,
              and sending
              their decrees
              to other Churches
              for their concurrence with them:
              and such decrees
              confirmed
              by an
              universal
              consent, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls
              the decrees
            
            of the whole world, and indeed did
              better serve the ends
              of Catholick
              Communion than any general Council
              did.
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus I doubt not, but a late
              learned
              Author has
              given
              a very true account of the unity of the
              Christian
              Church according
              to ancient practice,
              when he tells
              us. <hi>The peace of the Church
              was
              preserved
              by communion
            
            
            of all parts
              together, not by the subjection
              of the rest to one part:</hi> though I do not think he
              has
              made
              a true representation
              of it, when he saies,
              <hi>That the case of Bishops
              was
              like to that of</hi>
            
            <hi>Princes,
              each of whom
              hath
              a free superintendence
              in his own territory, but to uphold justice and peace in the
              world, or between adjacent Nations,
              the intercourse of several Princes
              is
              needful.</hi> For this makes
              Christian Communion as arbitrary
              a thing, as the confederacies
              of Princes;
              whereas the Episcopal Office
              is
              but one, and therefore ought to be
              administred
              by the mutual advice and consent of
              Bishops,
              who all equally
              share in it. And Catholick
              Communion
              is
              essential to the unity of the Church, and he who
              violates
              it by an
              unreasonable dissent, whatever he be,
              is
              a Schismatick,
              and therefore no member of the Catholick
            
            Church; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
              tells
              us that such cannot retain either
              the power or the honour of a Bishop. The Christian Church
              is
              governed
              by the Episcopal Colledge,
            
            
            
            wherein every Bishop has
              equal power, but
              yet is
              by his Office obliged,
              as far as it is
              possible to govern his own Church by the advice and
              consent of his
              Collegues,
              where there is
              need of it, and where it can be
              had;
              which is
              a very different thing from the arbitrary
              combinations
              of secular Princes.

            3. Of the same nature were
              those Letters
              of recommendation granted
              to Presbyters
              or private Christians
              (who had
              occasion to travel) from those Churches
              of which they were
              members,
              to other Churches,
              whither they went,
              which were
              called
              formed
              or communicatory Letters:
              the design of which was
              to satisfie
              foreign Churches,
              that those persons
              who brought
              such Letters
              were
              in communion with the Church which
              sent
              them;
              and therefore to desire them
              to admit them
              to their communion, and to show
              them
              such respect and kindness, as became
              Christian Brethren, while they stayed
              with them:
              for the ancient discipline
              was
              very severe in admitting
              strangers,
              who were
              unknown to them,
              to communion, lest they should
            
            
            admit Hereticks,
              or Schismaticks,
              or Excommunicated
              persons:
              and therefore
              if any such came,
              who could not produce their recommendatory
              Letters,
              but pretended
              to have lost
              them
              by the way, they were
              neither admitted
              to communion, nor wholly
              refused,
              but if occasion were,
              maintained
              by the Church, till such Letters
              could be procured
              from the Church from whence they
              came,
              which was
              called
              the <hi>communio peregrina,</hi> as <hi>Albaspinus</hi>
              has
              observed.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was
              a plain argument of communion between those
              Churches,
              who sent,
              and who received
              such Letters,
              that they would recommend and receive each others
              members
              to communion,
              and by such Letters
              <hi>Optatus</hi> tells
              us
            
            Catholick
              Communion
              was
              maintained
              So much is
              that Learned
              man mistaken,
              who makes
              this no more, than as Princes
              <hi>sometimes
              recommend</hi>
            
            <hi>their Subjects
              to other Princes;
              they expect offices
              of humanity toward their Subjects,
              travelling
              or trading
              any where in the world; common reason doth require such
            
            
            
            things,
              but may common union of polity from hence be
              inferred?</hi>
              I answer, Catholick
              Communion may, that all the Churches
              in the world were
              united
              in one body, and one communion;
              for they were
              received
              into all the rights
              and priviledges
              of Christian Communion in the Church whither they
              went,
              by being
              owned
              members
              of the Church from whence they came:
              which cannot be said
              of the subjects
              of <hi>England</hi> when they travel into <hi>France</hi> or
              <hi>Spain,</hi> though recommended
              by their Princes
              Letters,
              which may procure them
              civil treatment,
              but not make them
              free Denisons.
              There was
              no other distinction
              in the ancient Church between occasional
              and fixed
              communion (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
              calls
              it) but occasional or fixed
              residence: every Christian was
              as much a member of every Church, while he
              was
              there, as those who were
              constant Inhabitants,
              and enjoyed
              constant communion in that Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if it might not be thought immodest
              to pass a censure upon so great, and so
              deservedly
              admired
              a man, I
            
            
            should venture to say, that he was
              so much bent upon opposing
              that notion of
              Church Unity, which set up a supreme and sovereign power
              over the Catholick
              Church, such a constitutive
              Regent Head, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have over a National
              Church (which he has
              effectually
              done
              beyond all contradiction) that he
              was
              not so careful to avoid some expressions,
              which might seem to reflect upon
              Catholick
              Communion. He has
              given
              a true and perfect account, wherein
              the unity of the ancient Church
              consisted,
              but to avoid a sovereign Church Power,
              has
              made
              Catholick
              Communion (which is
              the only cement
              of Catholick
              Unity, and the only
              foundation of Ecclesiastical Discipline)
              too arbitrary a thing, like the
              confederacies
              of Sovereign Princes.
              Not that I suspect so great a man,
              was
              either ignorant or unsensible of the necessary
              obligations
              to Catholick
              Communion, but that not being
              the subject of the present Dispute, he
              did
              less attend to the due stating
              that side of the question.
          </p>
          <p n="2">
            
            
            
            2. After this I need say little to that Communion which
              was
              maintained
              between distant Churches,
              and private Christians,
              who were
              members
              of such Churches,
              which was
              to own each other as Sister Churches,
              and actually
              to communicate with one another, as occasion and
              opportunity
              offered.
          </p>
          <p>II. Let us now briefly
            consider, what place there can be for
            Catholick
            Communion in this broken
            and divided
            state of the Church, which we see at this day: I confess the
            divisions
            of Christendom are matter of very sad lamentation, the Church
            being
            now so shattered
            and torn,
            that we cannot find any one entire
            communion, in
            a National, much less in the Universal Church.</p>
          <p>
            But yet I take that man to be a
              Catholick
              Christian, not who communicates
              with all Sects
              and Parties
              of Christians
              (which is
              Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s notion of a Catholick
              Christian) but he who preserves
              the Communion of the Church wherein he
              lives;
              and is
              ready as occasion shall offer to communicate
            
            
            with all Christian Churches,
              which are neither Schismatical nor
              Heretical.
              By Schismatical, I mean those Churches,
              which separate from the National Church, wherein they live,
              without just and necessary reason, which can be nothing less
              than sinful terms
              of Communion; and by Heretical,
              those which impose any Doctrine
              as the terms
              of communion, which contradicts
              some plain and express
              Article of Faith. It cannot be expected
              from me, that I should particularly
              apply this general rule to the various
              communions
              of foreign Churches,
              since my present argument confines
              me to home; it may suffice for my present purpose, to have
              given
              this short and general account of
              Catholick
              Communion.

          <head>The Conclusion.</head>
          <p>
            THus I have as briefly
              as I could, explained
              the true nature of Christian Union, and therein
              answered
              all those pleas
              for separation, which relate to the constitution of our
              Church; and have occasionally
              taken
              notice of several others: For though our
              Adversaries
              talk loud of sinful terms
              of communion, yet they are willing, if they can, to shelter
              themselves in some more obscure
              controversies,
              of which the people are least capable of
              judging,
              but will readily
              believe upon their authority to be a sufficient reason for
              their separation;
              or else they cast such mists
              before mens
              eyes
              by wild and perplexed
              descriptions
              of Schism, which dwindle it into nothing, or make it a very
              innocent and harmless thing, that they cannot discover
              either what it is,
              or what is
              the evil or danger of
            
            
            it: and therefore my great design in this
              undertaking
              has
              been
              to cut off all these retreats,
              and so to state the notion
              of Christian Unity, that every man may understand what
              Schism is,
              and be made
              sensible how inconsistent it is
              with the true principles
              of Christianity,
              and how destructive to mens souls.
          </p>
          <p>As for the terms
            of our communion (where the controversie
            must at last rest, if what I have now
            discoursed
            hold true) they have been
            so often and so learnedly
            defended,
            and so little
            occasion given
            by any late assault for a fresh defence, that, I thought, I
            should do very good service by bringing
            the cause to that issue again, though I there left it as I
            found it; and yet in my answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s search for
            the English Schismatick,
            I have briefly
            considered
            what he has
            objected
            against our communion, which I hear also
            is
            lately
            done
            by another hand, in answer to the <hi>Melius
            Inquirendum.</hi></p>
          <p>
            I shall conclude all with this one observation, how vain all
              those projects
              of union are, which will not unite
              Christians
              in one communion;
            
            
            
            they may possibly
              for a time prevent cutting
              of throats,
              but cannot heal the Schisms
              of the Christian Church; and what little reason we have ever
              to expect an
              union with men
              of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> principles,
              who will not
            
            allow, that <hi>all lawful things
              are to be done
              for the Churches
              peace:</hi> God preserve
              his Church, and all good Christians
              from such schismatical Principles,
              as make it impossible to preserve Christian Unity and
              Communion when we have it, or to restore it, when it
              is
              lost.
              <hi>Amen.</hi>
