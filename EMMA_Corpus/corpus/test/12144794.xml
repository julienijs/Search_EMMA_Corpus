          <head>THE LIFE OF The most Learned
            and Reverend, Dr. PETER HEYLYN.</head>
          <p>
            TO Write the
              Lives
              of worthy Personages
              was
              ever accounted
              a most laudable custom amongst the
              Heathens:
              For to perpetuate the memory of the Dead, who
              were
              eminent in Vertue,
              did
              manifestly
              conduce to the
              publique
              benefit of the Living;
              much more the Ancient Christians
              in their time, both solemnly
              retained
              this practice, and adjudged
              it an
              act of Piety and Justice to the
              Deceased.
              If they were
              Men
              of Fame for Learning,
              or other Virtues,
              to Celebrate their praises
              to Posterity, and by this means
              stir up Emulation in others, to follow so noble
              precedents
              before them.
              For which cause S. <hi>Jerom</hi> writ his <hi>Catalogus
              illustrium Virorum;</hi>
              before whom
              also <hi>Eusebius,</hi> with others, in short
              recorded
              to future Ages,
              the holy Lives
              of those Primitive Fathers,
              who were
              signally
              active or passive for the Christian Faith.
            
            <hi>Suum cuique decus posteritas
              rependit,</hi> saith
              the Historian: <hi>Posterity doth render to every man the
              Commendation he deserves.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore for the Reverend Authors
              sake, and in due Veneration of his Name, which I doubt not
              is
              honoured
              by all true Sons
              of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both for his
              Learned
              Writings
              and constant Sufferings
              in defence of
              her Doctrine and Discipline established
              by Law, here is
              faithfully
              presented
              to them
              a true and compleat
              Narrative of his Life, before his Elaborate
              Works
              Reprinted;
              to answer the common expectation of
              men
              in this case, who would read his Person (together with the
              ordinary and
              extraordinary occurrences
              of Providence that befel
              him)
              as well as his Books
              that were
              long before published
              to the World. To give satisfaction in the former, here
              is
              nothing inserted
              but the Relations
              of truth, which hath
              been
              often heard
              from his own mouth spoken
              to his dearest
              Friends,
              or written
              by his Pen in some loose fragments
              of Paper that were
              found left in his Study after his death; upon which, as on a
              sure foundation, the whole Series and Structure of the
              following
              Discourse is
              laid
              together, but would have been
              more happily
              done,
              if he had
              left larger
              Memoirs
              for it. Nothing was
              more usual in ancient times,
              than for good men,
              saith
              <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to describe their own
              Lives.
              <hi>Suam
            
            
            
            ipsi vitam narrare,</hi>
            
            <hi>fiduciam potius morum, quam arrogantiam arbitrati
              sunt.</hi> Upon a confidence of their right behaviour,
              rather than to be supposed
              any arrogancy or presumption in
              them.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all I shall begin with his Birth. In that Country
              above all other, enobled
              with the famous seat of the Muses,
              to which he was
              a constant Votary;
            
            by <hi>Cambden, Oxford</hi> is
              called
              the Sun, Eye and Soul of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> by
              <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> the second School of the Church; the
              present Author saith,
              co-eval to <hi>Paris,</hi> if not before it, the glory of
              this Island, and of the <hi>Western</hi>
              parts;
              near which place, or noble <hi>Athens, Peter
              Heylyn</hi>
              was
              Born at <hi>Burford,</hi> an
              ancient Town, of good Note in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
              upon the 29th. day of <hi>Novemb.
              An.
              Dom.</hi> 1600. in the same year with the
              Celebrated
              Historian,
            
            <hi>Jacobus Aug. Thuanus,</hi> on both
              whom
              the Stars
              poured
              forth the like benign influences;
              But the former, <hi>viz. Peter Heylyn</hi>
              had
              not only the faculty of an
              Historian, but the gift of a general Scholar in other
              Learning,
              , as will appear to any one that
              reads
              his laborious
              Writings.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was
              second Son of <hi>Henry Heylyn</hi>
              Gentleman, Descended
              from the Ancient Family of the <hi>Heylyns,</hi> of
              <hi>Pentre-Heylyn</hi>
              in <hi>Moungomery-Shire,</hi> then part of
              <hi>Powis-Land,</hi> from the Princes
              whereof they were
              derived,
              and unto whom
              they were
              Hereditary Cup-Bearers;
              for so the word <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              doth signifie
              in the <hi>Welsh</hi> or <hi>Brittish</hi>
              Language: An
              Honourable Office in most Nations,
              which we find in Divine as well as Profane History,
              <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Magni honoris erat Pincernae munus
              apud Perss,</hi> saith
              <hi>Alex. ab. Alex.</hi> And if <hi>Cambden Clarencieux</hi>
              be of good Authority, the Reverend Doctor
              deriveth
              his Pedegree
              from <hi>Greno ap Heylyn,</hi>
              who descended
              from <hi>Brockwell Skythrac,</hi> one of the
              Princes
              of <hi>Powis-Land,</hi> a man of so great Authority with the
              Princes
              of <hi>North-Wales,</hi>
              that <hi>Llewellyn</hi> the last Prince of that Country
              made
              choice of the said
              <hi>Grono-ap-Heylyn</hi> to treat with the
              Commissioners
              of <hi>Edward</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> for the
              concluding
              a final Peace between them;
              which afterwards
              being
              broken
              by <hi>L'lewellyn,</hi> in him
              ended
              all the Princes
              of <hi>North-Wales,</hi>
              after they had
              Reigned
              for the space of 405. years;
              a goodly time, that scarcely
              the greatest
              Monarchies
              in the World have withstood
              their fatal period and dissolution. Yet the Family of
              <hi>Pentre Heylyn,</hi>
              from whom
              the said
              <hi>Grono-ap-Heylyn</hi> descended
              in a direct Line, continued
              their Seat, until the year <hi>Anno Dom,</hi> 1637. at which
              time <hi>Rowland
              Heylyn,</hi>
              Alderman and Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> and Cousin-german
              to Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s
              Father, dying
              without Issue-Male, the Seat was
              transferred
              into another Family, into which the
              Heiresses
              Married;
              but if the Doctor had
              lived
              a little longer,
              he intended
              to have repurchased
              that Seat, and bring it back again into the Name and Family.
              His Cousin Mr. <hi>Rowland
              Heylyn,</hi>
              before his death, caused
              the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Brittish</hi>
              Bible to be Printed
              at his own Charges,
              in a portable Volume, for the benefit of his
              Country-men,
              which was
              before in a
              large Church Folio; also the <hi>Practice of Piety</hi> in
              <hi>Welch,</hi> a Book, though common, not to be
              despised;
              besides,
              a <hi>Welch</hi> Dictionary for the better
              understanding
              of that Language. One thing of chief remark
              is,
              a Tradition among the <hi>Heylyns,</hi>
              deriving
              their Pedigree from <hi>Brockwell Skythrac,</hi> in whose
              Family was
              ever observed
              that one of them
              had
              a gag Tooth, and the same a notable Omen of good Fortune,
              which mark of the Tooth is
              still continued
              in the Doctors
              Family. These and such like signatures
              of more wonderful form, are indeed very rare, yet not
              without example: So <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and his
              Children
              after him,
              were
              Born
            
            
            with the figure of an
              Anchor upon their Thigh, as an
              infallible mark of their true Geniture,
              saith
              <hi>Justin. Origenis hujus argumentum etiam
              posteris
              mansit. Si quidem filii, nepotes{que} ejus anchoram in
              semore veluti notam generis naturalem habuere.</hi>
            
          </p>
          <p>The Mother of Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            was
            <hi>Eliz. Clampard,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Francis
            Clampard,</hi> of <hi>Wrotham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> Gent. and
            of <hi>Mary Dodge,</hi> his Wife,
            descended
            in a direct Line from <hi>Peter Dodge,</hi> of
            <hi>Stopworth</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> unto
            whom
            King <hi>Edw.</hi> I. gave
            the Seigniory
            or Lordship of <hi>Padenhugh,</hi> in the Barony of
            <hi>Coldingham,</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as
            well for his special Services
            that he did
            in the Sieges
            of <hi>Barwick</hi>
            and <hi>Dunbar,</hi> as for his
            Valour
            shewed
            in divers
            Battels,
            <hi>encontre son grand Enemy 
            Rebelle
            le Baillol Roy d'Escose  Vasial d'Angleterre;</hi> as the
            words
            are in the original
            Charter of Arms,
            given
            to the said
            <hi>Peter Dodge</hi> by <hi>Guyen</hi> King of
            Arms,
            at the Kings
            command, dated
            <hi>April</hi> the 8th. in the 34th. year of the
            said
            K. <hi>Edw.</hi> I. one of the Descendants
            from the said
            <hi>Peter Dodge,</hi> was
            Uncle to Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Mother, and
            gave
            the Mannor
            of <hi>Lechlade</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi>
            worth 1400 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> to <hi>Robert Bathurst</hi>
            Esq Uncle to the Doctor, and Grand-father to that honest and
            loyal Gentleman, Sir <hi>Edw. Bathurst</hi> now
            living.</p>
          <p>In the sixth year of his Age, he
            was
            committed
            to the Tuition of Mr. <hi>North,</hi> School-master of
            <hi>Burford;</hi> under whose instructions
            he profited
            so well, that in a short time he could make true Latin, and
            arrived
            to an
            ability of making
            Verses;
            to which excellency, together with History, his genius
            was
            so naturally
            addicted,
            that at the Age of ten years
            he framed
            a story in Verse and Prose, which he
            composed
            in imitation of
            the destruction of <hi>Troy</hi> with some other
            Books
            of Chivalry, upon which he was
            then very studious and intent. I presume to mention it as
            an
            argument of the prodigious pregnancy of those
            endowments
            which God had
            bestowed
            on him;
            for he may be truly
            accounted
            one of the <hi>praecoces fructus,</hi> the forward
            fruits
            of his Age, that was
            soon ripe and contrary to the Proverb,
            was
            of lasting
            duration. It may be affirmed
            of him
            as it was
            of <hi>Lipsius, Ingenium habuit docile  omnium capax:
            memoria non sine praeceptorum miraculo, etiam in puero quae in
            senectute non defecit.</hi></p>
          <p>His old Master <hi>North</hi>
            dying,
            he was
            committed
            to another, who succeeded
            in the same School, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> a right
            Reverend and good man, by whom
            he was
            sent
            to <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the beginning
            of <hi>Decemb.</hi>
            1613. at the 14th. year of his Age, and
            placed
            under the Tuition of Mr. <hi>Joseph Hill,</hi>
            an
            ancient Batchelor
            in Divinity, once one of the Fellows
            of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Coll. but then a Commoner of
            <hi>Hart-Hall;</hi> Mr. <hi>Walter
            Newbery,</hi>
            (afterward a Zealous <hi>Puritan</hi>)
            was
            made
            choice of to instruct him
            in Logick,
            and other Academical Studies,
            wherein he made
            such good progress, that upon the 22 of <hi>July,</hi> 1614.
            he stood
            to be Demy of <hi>Magdalen</hi>
            College, which he missed
            of at the first Election; but in the year after
            succeeded,
            having
            endeared
            himself to the President Dr. <hi>Langton,</hi> and
            Fellows
            of the same Colledge,
            by the pleasantness of a Latin Poem upon a Journey that he
            made
            with his two Tutors
            unto <hi>Woodstock.</hi> After his admission into that noble
            Foundation, within the space of a twelve month, he
            was
            made
            Impositor of the Hall; in which Office he
            acquitted
            himself so excellently,
            that the Dean of the College continued
            him
            longer
            in it, than any ever before; for which reason, he
            was
            called
            by those Scholars
            of his own standing,
            <hi>Perpetual Dictator.</hi> He then
            composed
            an
            English Tragedy, celled
            <hi>Spurius,</hi> which was
            so well approved
            by some Learned
            Persons
            in the College, that the President
            caused
            it to be privately
            Acted
            in his own Lodgings.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1617. he obtained
            his grace for the Degree of Batchelor
            of Arts,
            according
            to the College Statutes,
            which requiring
            some exercise to be performed
            by a Batchelor
            of Arts
            in the long Vacation, he began
            his Cosmographical Lectures,
            and finished
            them
            in the end of the next <hi>August.</hi>
            His performance of this exercise
            drew
            that whole Society into a profound admiration of his great
            Learning
            and Abilities;
            insomuch, that before he had
            done
            reading
            those Lectures,
            he was
            admitted
            Fellow upon probation, in the place of Mr. <hi>Love.</hi> And
            that he might give a testimony of his grateful mind to
            them,
            he writ a Latin Comedy, which he
            called
            <hi>Theomachia,</hi> which he finished
            and transcribed
            in a fortnight space, on <hi>July</hi> the 19th. 1619. He
            was
            admitted
            <hi>in verum  perpetuum socium,</hi> and not long before
            was
            made
            Moderator of the Senior Form, which he
            retained
            above two years;
            and within that compass of time, he
            began
            to write his <hi>Geography,</hi>
            accordingly
            as he design'd when he read his <hi>Cosmography</hi>
            Lectures;
            which Book he finished
            in little more than two months,
            beginning
            at <hi>Feb.</hi>
            22. and compleating
            it on the 29th. of <hi>April</hi>
            following.
            At the next Act, which was
            <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1620. he was
            admitted
            Master of Arts,
            the honour of which degree was
            more remarkable,
            because that very year, the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi>
            Chancellor of the University, signified
            his pleasure by special Letters,
            <hi>That from that time forward the
            Masters
            of Arts,
            who before sate bare, should wear their
            Caps
            in all Congregations
            and Convocations.</hi></p>
          <p>He committed
            his <hi>Geography</hi> to the perusal of some
            Learned
            Friends,
            which being
            by them
            well approved,
            he obtained
            his Fathers
            consent for the Printing
            of it, which was
            done
            accordingly,
            <hi>Novemb.</hi> 7. 1621. The first Copy of it
            was
            by him
            presented
            to King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, then Prince of
            <hi>Wales,</hi>
            unto whom
            he Dedicated
            it, and by whom,
            together with its
            Author, it was
            very graciously
            received,
            being
            introduced
            into the Princes
            presence by Sir <hi>Robert Carre,</hi>
            since Earl of <hi>Ancram,</hi> one of the
            Gentlemen
            of his Highnesses
            Bed-Chamber. In some months
            after his Father died
            at <hi>Oxon,</hi> with an
            Ulcer in his Bladder, occasioned
            by the Stone, with which he had
            been
            many years
            grievously
            afflicted.
            He was
            conveyed
            to <hi>Lechlade</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi>
            where he was
            buried
            near his Wife, who departed
            this life six years
            before him,
            and was
            solemnly
            buried
            in the Chancel of that Parish Church.</p>
          <p>
            <hi>Septemb.</hi> the 15th. 1622. he
              received
              Confirmation from the hands
              of Bishop <hi>Lake,</hi> in the Parish Church of
              <hi>Wells,</hi>
              and in a short time after exhibited
              a Certificate to Dr. <hi>Langton,</hi>
              concerning
              his Age; by which means
              he obtained
              a Dispensation, notwithstanding any local
              Statutes
              to the contrary, that he should not be compell'd to enter
              into holy Orders
              till he was
              24 years
              of Age, according
              to the time appointed,
              both by the Canons
              of the Church, and the Statutes
              of the Realm. His fear was
              then very great, to enter upon the study of Divinity, as
              well as undertake
              the profession of it; but afterward
              persuaded
              thereto by a Right Reverend and
              Learned
              Person, Mr. <hi>Buckner,</hi> he
              seriously
              applied
              himself to this Study, and holy Profession,
              receiving
              the Orders
              of Deacon and Priest, (but at distinct
              times)
              in S. <hi>Aldates</hi> Church in <hi>Oxon,</hi> from the
              Right Reverend Bishop <hi>Howson.</hi> And when he
              was
              Ordained
              Priest, he Preach'd the Ordination Sermon upon these
              words
              of our Blessed
              Saviour to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.32. <hi>And when thou
              art Converted,
              strengthen thy Brethren:</hi>
              What course and method he observed
              in his Theological Studies,
              he informs
              us with his own Pen,
            
            <hi>When I began
              my Studies
              in Divinity, I thought no course so proper and expedient for
              me, as the way commended
              by
            
            
            King</hi> James, <hi>which was,
              that young Students
              in Divinity should be excited
              to study such Books
              as were
              most agreeable in Doctrine and Discipline to the Church
              of</hi> England, <hi>and to bestow their time in the
              Fathers
              and Councils,
              School-men,
              Histories,
              and Controversie,
              and not to insist too long upon
              Compendiums
              and Abbreviators.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>His <hi>Geography</hi> was
            in less than three years
            Reprinted:
            And in this second
            Edition was
            enlarged,
            and again presented
            by him
            to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
            and by him
            graciously
            received,
            with most affectionate commendations
            of the Author. But it met
            with another kind of entertainment from King <hi>James;</hi>
            for the Book being
            put into the hands
            of that Learned
            Monarch, by Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Winton,</hi>
            (who design'd nothing but the highest
            kindness to Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            thereby) the King at first exprest
            his great value he had
            for the Author; but unfortunatly
            falling
            on a passage, wherein Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            gave
            Precedency to the <hi>French</hi> King, and
            called
            <hi>France</hi> the more famous Kingdom; King <hi>James</hi>
            became
            very much offended,
            and ordered
            the Lord Keeper to call the Book in. The Dean
            gave
            notice to Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            of his Majesties
            displeasure, and advised
            him
            to repair to Court, and make use of the
            Princes
            Patronage, as the best lenitive to prevent the
            rankling
            of this wound. But he rather chose
            to abide in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and
            acquainting
            the Lord <hi>Danvers</hi> with the business, afterward
            sent
            an
            Apology and Explanation of his meaning:
            That the burden under which he suffered,
            was
            rather a mistake than a crime, and that mistake not his own,
            but the Printers,
            which was
            after corrected
            and amended.</p>
          <p>In the year 1625. he took
            a Journey with Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi>
            into <hi>France,</hi> where he visited
            more Cities,
            and made
            more observations
            in five weeks
            time, for he stayed
            no longer,
            than many others have done
            in so many years.
            The particulars
            of this Journey he reduced
            into writing,
            and some years
            after gratifi'd his Countrey
            with the publication of it, together with some other excellent
            remarks
            made
            by him,
            when he went
            in attendance upon the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to the Isle of
            <hi>Gernsey</hi> and <hi>Jersey,</hi> Anno Dom. 1628.
            Had
            King <hi>James</hi> lived
            to have perused
            that Book, Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            had
            needed
            no other Advocate to have restored
            him
            to his Princely favour and protection: For never
            was
            the vanity and levity of the Monsieurs,
            and deformity and sluttishness of their
            Madams
            more ingeniously
            exposed
            both in Verse and Prose, than in the account that he
            gives
            of his Voyage into <hi>France.</hi></p>
          <p>On <hi>April</hi> the 18th. 1627. he
            opposed
            in the Divinity-School; and on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 24th.
            following,
            he answered
            <hi>pro form</hi> upon these two
            Questions,
            <hi>viz.</hi></p>
          <q>
            <l>An
              Ecclesia unquam fuerit invisibilis?</l>
            <l>An
              Ecclesia possit errare?</l>
          </q>
          <p>
            Both which he determined
              in the <hi>Negative.</hi> Upon occasional discourse with
              him,
              he was
              pleased
              once to shew
              me his Supposition, which I read over in his House at
              <hi>Lacies-Court</hi>
              in <hi>Abingdon;</hi> but I had
              not then either the leisure or good luck to transcribe a
              Copy of it, which would have been
              worth my pains,
              and more worthy of the Press, to the great
              satisfaction
              of others: For my part, I can truly
              say, that I never read any thing with more delight, for good
              Latin, Reason, and History, which that Exercise
              was
              full of; but since, both it and many other choice
              Papers
              in his Study, through the carelesness
              of those, to whose custody
            
            
            
            they are committed,
              I suppose are utterly
              lost
              and gone,
              <hi>ad blattarum  tinearum Epulas.</hi> In
              stating
              of the first Question, that caused
              the heats
              of that day, he fell upon a quite different way from that of
              Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi>
              the Professor, in his Lecture <hi>De Visibilitate
              Ecclesiae,</hi> and contrary
              to the common opinion of other Divines,
              who generally
              prove the visibility of the Protestant Church from the poor
              persecuted
              Christians,
              dispersed
              in several places,
              as the <hi>Berengarians</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the
              <hi>Waldenses</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the
              <hi>Wicklifists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the
              <hi>Hussiets</hi> in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> which manner of
              proceeding
              being
              disliked
              by Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
              as that which utterly
              discontinued
              the Succession of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which the Church
              of <hi>England</hi>
              claims
              from the very Apostles
              and their immediate Successors:
              He rather chose
              to find out a continual visible Church in <hi>Asia,
              Ethiopia, Greece, Italy,</hi> yea and <hi>Rome</hi> it self;
              as also in all the <hi>Western</hi>
              Provinces
              then subject to the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, when
              he was
              the chief Patriarch, which Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              from his great knowledge, and more than ordinary
              abilities
              in History, strenuously
              asserted
              and proved,
              to which the Professor could make but weak
              replies,
              (as I have heard
              from knowing
              persons,
              who were
              present at that Disputation) because he
              was
              drawn
              out of his ordinany byass
              from Scholastical Disputation to
              forein
              Histories,
              in which encounter Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              was
              the invincible Ajax---<hi>Nec quisquam Ajacem superare
              possit nisi Ajax.</hi> But chiefly
              the quarrel did
              arise for two words
              in Mr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Hypothesis, after he
              had
              proved
              the Church of <hi>England</hi> received
              no Succession of Doctrine or Government from the
              <hi>Berengarians, Wicklifists,</hi> c. who
              held
              many Heterodoxies
              in Religion, as different from the
              established
              Doctrine of our Church, as any point which
              was
              maintained
              at that time in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that the
              Writers
              of that Church, <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
              himself hath
              stood
              up, as cordially
              in maintenance of some fundamental
              points
              of the Christian Faith against <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,
              Anabaptists,</hi>
              and other Heretiques
              of these last Ages,
              as any our Divines,
              and other Learned
              men
              of the Protestant Churches,
              which point Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              closed
              up with these words,
              <hi>Utinam quod ipse de Calvino sic semper errasset
              nobilissimus Cardinalis;</hi> at which
              words
              the Reverend Doctor was
              so impatient in his Chair, that he fell upon the Respondent
              in most vile terms,
              calling
              him
              <hi>Papicola, Bellarminianus, Pontificius,</hi> c. to
              draw the hatred of the University upon
              him,
              according
              to the saying,
              <hi>Fortiter calumniare  aliquid adhaerebit,</hi>
              grievously
              complaining
              to the younger
              sort of his Auditors,
              unto whom
              he made
              his chiefest
              addresses,
              of the unprofitable pains
              he took
              among them,
              if <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
              whom
              he had
              laboured
              to confute for so many years,
              should be honoured
              with the Title of <hi>Nobilissimus.</hi> Notwithstanding the
              Respondent acquitted
              himself bravely
              before the Company, ascribing
              no more honour to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
              than for his deserts
              in Learning,
              and Integrity in that particular point before
              spoken
              of, which any generous man would give to his
              Learned
              Antagonist. For many <hi>Lutherans</hi>
              and <hi>Calvinists</hi>
              I may say <hi>(pace tanti viri)</hi> so angry at a word,
              have not grudged,
              much less judged
              it any crime to praise the Cardinals
              Learning.
              <hi>Doctrinam  nos in ipso
              commendamus,</hi>
              saith
              a rigid <hi>Lutheran. Joh. Andr.
              Quenstedt.</hi>
              in his <hi>Dial. de pal. illust. Vir.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>
              would not stick to call him
              who was
              an
              inveterate Enemy
              of the Christians,
              <hi>Most Noble Festus.</hi> And though
              Cardinals
              we know were
              originally
              but Parish-Priests,
              by Pride and Usurpation have made
              themselves Compeers
              to Kings;
              that which is
              unjustly
              once obtained,
              by time groweth
              common and familiar, that none will refuse to give such
              their ordinary Titles
              of honour, although they come by indirect
              means,
            
            
            and not by merit to them.
              <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
              also was
              of no poor and base extraction,
              but better than his fellows;
              for which reason he was
              created
              Cardinal by <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. <hi>Hunc
              eligimus</hi> (saith
              he) <hi>quia est nepos optimi  sanctissimi
              pontificis,</hi>
            
            because he was
              the Nephew of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the II. who
              said,
              <hi>That he could not see how any one can be
              saved
              who sate in the Pontifical Chair:</hi>
            
            Non video quomodo qui locum hunc altissimum tenent salvari
              possunt.
          </p>
          <p>After these heats
            of Disputation were
            over, Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            took
            a Journey to
            <hi>London,</hi> where he waited
            on Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and
            <hi>Wells,</hi>
            who had
            heard
            of all the passages
            that had
            happened
            at <hi>Oxford,</hi> of which Mr.
            <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            gave
            a more perfect account to his Lordship,
            who was
            pleased
            to read over the Supposition, at which Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
            was
            so highly
            offended;
            but the good Bishop of the other side
            commended
            it, and encouraged
            Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            in his Studies;
            saying,
            <hi>That he himself had
            in his younger
            days
            maintained
            the same Positions
            in a Disputation, in S.</hi> Johns
            <hi>Colledge,</hi>
            that Mr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Hypothesis could not be
            overthrown
            in a fair way, exhorting
            him
            to continue in that moderate course: and that as God
            had
            given
            him
            more than ordinary gifts,
            so he would pray to God that he and others might employ
            them
            in such a way and manner, as might make up the
            breaches
            in the Walls
            of Christendom. He being
            now admitted
            Chaplain to his Majesty, the good Bishop
            instructed
            him
            with Counsel and wise cautions,
            how to behave himself in all circumstances
            suitably
            to the calling
            and dignity of his place; telling
            him
            amongst other things,
            <hi>That the King did
            not love Silk nor Sattin
            Chaplains,</hi>
            which Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            ever observed
            both young and old, never ru_fling
            in Silks,
            like some of his Brotherhood, but
            went
            alway in a plain, grave, and decent habit. In
            <hi>November</hi> next following,
            he Preached
            in his course before the King, on those
            words,
            <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Our
            Fathers
            Worshipped
            on this Mountain,</hi> c. In which Sermon he
            declared
            himself with such smart zeal, and with as quick
            judgment
            against several errors
            and corruptions
            in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Sermon
            was
            better resented
            by the King than his Supposition by the
            Kings
            Professor in <hi>Oxon;</hi> who though a Right
            Learned
            man for his place, yet so dogmatical in his own
            points,
            that he would not abide to be touch'd, much less
            contradicted
            by Mr. <hi>Heylyn--- Non aliam ob causam, nisi quod Virtus in
            utro{que} summa fuit</hi> --- Hor. More
            especially
            being
            a great man, at that time very popular in the University,
            profoundly
            admired
            by the Junior Masters,
            and some of the Seniors
            inclined
            to Puritanism, his own College then
            observed
            to be the Nurse of West-Countrey-men in Puritan
            principles,
            Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            could expect no favour, nor fair
            dealing
            in the way of Disputation, when it
            ran
            contrary to the Professors
            humour.</p>
          <p>
            After these Academical contests,
              growing
              weary of Obs and Sols
              in Scholastical Disputations,
              which was
              ever opposite to his genius, and for this purpose unwilling
              to be always
              Cloystred
              up within the Walls
              of his College, where he must be
              tied
              to such Exercises;
              besides
              a man of an
              airy and active spirit, though studious and contemplative,
              would not perpetually
              be devoted
              to a melancholy recluse life. Therefore he
              resolved
              to Marry, and try his fortune in the World, <hi>Neque aliud

              of her Person, Wit, and Friends,
              besides
              a considerable Portion, all concentring
              together for his more happy contentment; and because Mr.
              <hi>Edward Heylyn,</hi>
              his Elder Brother, had
              before Married
              a Sister of this Lady, another of the
              Daughters
              of the said
              <hi>Thomas Heygate:</hi> His Seat
              was
              at <hi>Minster Lovel,</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
              where his Son (to whom
              Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              was
              Uncle) now liveth,
              <hi>viz. Hen. Heylyn</hi>
              Esq one of his Majesties
              Justices
              of the Peace for that County, an
              ancient Colonel and excellent Commander in the Army of King
              <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and a most
              accomplisht
              Gentleman in all respects,
              to the honour of his Family.
          </p>
          <p>Near which place of <hi>Minster,</hi> he
            had
            the Advouson
            of <hi>Bradwell,</hi> a very good
            Living
            in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi>
            together with a Rent-charge of Inheritance,
            paid
            him
            out of the Mannor
            of <hi>Lechlad:</hi> He parted
            with his Title to <hi>Bradwell,</hi>
            resolving
            to lay the foundation of his following
            Fortune by his own Industry, and not to bury himself in the
            unimprovable way of a rural life, He found out
            an
            honest Art, by which he might recommend
            himself to the
            Patronage of some noble mind, and that
            was
            to assert the History of St. <hi>George,</hi> Patron of the
            most Noble Order of the Garter; a business as he
            tells
            the King in his Epistle Dedicatory, of so intricate and
            involv'd a nature, that he had
            no guide to follow, nor any path to tread, but what he
            made
            unto himself. And it had
            never come to perfection, had
            not so able an
            hand as Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s
            undertaken
            it, whose accomplishments
            and industry were
            superior to every thing but themselves. Against this History
            Dr. <hi>Hackwel</hi> appeared
            in Print; of which the King hearing,
            sent
            for Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
            commanding
            him
            to consider the Arguments
            of his Antagonist, and withal sent
            him
            to <hi>Windsor</hi> to search the
            Records
            of the Order. This occasioned
            a second Edition of the History, wherein
            were
            answered
            all Dr. <hi>Hackwels</hi> Arguments
            and Allegations,
            to which there was
            never made
            a reply; but on the contrary, in his Book about the
            supposed
            Decay of Nature, a Retractation of the
            passages
            relating
            to S. <hi>George.</hi></p>
          <p>
            About this time he had
              a presentation given
              him
              by one Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi>
              to the Parsonage of <hi>Meysie-Hampton,</hi> in the
              Diocess
              of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
              unto the Bishop whereof he made
              his Application, but found him
              already preingaged
              to further the pretended
              Title of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Coll. in <hi>Oxon.</hi>
              However his Lordship promised
              not to give Institution to any person till the title
              was
              cleared,
              and therefore advised
              Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              to leave his presentation
              with him,
              and to enter a Caveat in his Court. But he who
              was
              false to God, and his Mother-church, could never be faithful
              to the engagements
              which he made
              to Man: The one he deserted
              by turning
              <hi>Papist,</hi>
              being
              the only Bishop of the English Hierarchy, that
              renounced
              a persecuted
              Church to embrace the Idolatries
              and Errors
              of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.
              And the other he violated
              by giving
              one Mr. <hi>Jackson</hi> (who
            
            
            came
              from <hi>C.C.C.</hi>) Institution so soon as ever he
              requested
              it, which occasioned
              a tedious suit at Law after.
          </p>
          <p>Neither was
            this the only disappointment he
            met
            with in the way of his Preferment. For not long after,
            Preaching
            at Court in his second Attendance, his Majesty express'd a
            very high opinion of him
            to many noble Lords
            about him,
            and in a few months
            after gave
            him
            a Presentation
            to the Rectory of <hi>Hemingford,</hi> in the County of
            <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> But this also
            missed
            of the desired
            effect, which his Majesties
            bounty designed,
            and Mr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> necessity after a long suit of Law
            for the other Living,
            required.
            For the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> unto
            whom
            he made
            Application with his Presentation, would not allow the King to
            have any title to the Living,
            so he was
            constrained
            to return back to <hi>London, re infecta.</hi> The Bishop
            was
            much offended
            that a young Divine should have so great knowledge in Law,
            (which was
            the beginning
            of all the following
            Differences
            between them)
            for Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            made
            good the Kings
            Right upon the passages
            of the conveyances
            of the other party. His Majesty
            presently
            understood
            the entertainment he met
            with at <hi>Bugden,</hi> and sent
            him
            this gracious Message, <hi>That he
            was
            sorry he had
            put him
            to so much charge and trouble, but it should not be long
            before he would be out of his debt.</hi> And he soon
            performed
            his Royal promise, for within a week after, he
            bestowed
            upon him
            a Prebendship of <hi>Westminster,</hi> void by the death of
            Mr. <hi>Danel,</hi> to the extream
            vexation of his Lordship, who was
            then <hi>Dean</hi> of the same Church. And that which
            added
            to the honour of this preferment,
            was
            not only his being
            initiated
            the very same day into the acquaintance and friendship with
            the Attorney-General, Mr. <hi>Noye;</hi>
            but the gracious Message that came
            along with the Royal gift, <hi>viz.</hi> That he
            bestowed
            that Prebendship on him,
            to bear the charges
            of his last Journey,
            but still he was
            in debt for the Living.</p>
          <p>Being
            possessed
            of this Preferment, the first honourable Visit that he
            received
            in his new Habitation, was
            from the Learned
            Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> who brought
            along with him
            one Capt. <hi>Nelson,</hi> that
            pretended
            to find out a way for the discovery of the Longitude of the
            Sea; the Captain had
            imparted
            his design to many learned
            Mathematicians,
            who by no means
            could approve of or subscribe to his
            demonstrations.
            But the King refer'd him
            to Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
            who told
            that noble Lord, That his Majesty
            was
            mistaken
            in him,
            his skill and knowledge lying
            more in the Historical than the Philosophical part of
            Geography; yet notwithstanding
            he gave
            a full account thereof in writing,
            according
            to the best of his judgment,
            which is
            too long to set down here.</p>
          <p>His mind being
            intent rather upon useful than notional
            Learning,
            therefore about
            this time he began
            with great diligence to read over the
            Statute
            Laws
            of the Nation, and to compare them
            with the time and circumstances
            that occurr'd in story, which he
            carefully
            perused,
            the better to
            inable himself for his Majesties
            Service, who then had
            the Small-pox appearing
            on him,
            but he soon recovered
            from that distemper: Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            to testifie
            his joy, turn'd Poet, making
            a Copy of English Verses,
            which one of his Friends
            presented
            to the King; and they were
            so well lik'd, that both their Majesties
            gave
            him
            the honour of their thanks.</p>
          <p>
            But his Majesty found employment rather for the
              judgment,
              than fancy of the Chaplain; and therefore upon <hi>Jan.</hi>
              27. 1632. sent
              for him
              to the Council Table, where he received
              his Royal commands
              to read over that Book of Mr. <hi>Pryns,</hi>
              called
              <hi>Histriomastix,</hi> and to collect thence all such
            
            
            
            passages
              as were
              scandalous or dangerous to the King or State, and to reduce
              them
              into method. The Book was
              delivered
              to him,
              and a fortnights
              time assigned
              him
              to perform that Task imposed.
              But he had
              learned
              from the wisest
              of men,
              that diligence in business, and a quick dispatch of it,
              would qualifie
              him
              for the service of Kings,
              and not mean Persons.
              And therefore he finished
              what was
              expected
              from him,
              and carried
              it to the Secretary of State in less than four
              days;
              for which he had
              his Majesties
              thanks,
              as also new commands
              to revise his Papers,
              and to write down such Logical Inferences
              as might naturally
              arise from the premises
              of Mr. <hi>Pryn:</hi> About this time, and upon this
              occasion he wrote
              a small Tract touching
              the punishments
              due by Law, and in point of practice, unto such
              offenders
              as Mr. <hi>Pryn.</hi> And this was
              observable in the tryal
              of that Person, that nothing was
              urged
              by the Council to aggravate his
              faults,
              than what was
              contained
              in Mr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Collections.
          </p>
          <p>For the reward of which, and other good
            services,
            that with wonderful
            prudence, as well as diligence, he
            faithfully
            performed;
            His Majesty
            was
            graciously
            pleased
            to requite him,
            by bestowing
            on him
            the Parsonage of <hi>Houghton,</hi> in the
            Bishoprick
            of <hi>Durham,</hi> worth near 400 <hi>l. per annum,</hi>
            which afterward he exchanged
            with Dr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> for the
            Parsonage of
            <hi>Alresford</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> that
            was
            about the same value; to which exchange he
            was
            commanded
            by his Majesty, that he might live
            nearer
            the Court, for readiness to do his
            Majesties
            Service. Neither was
            he envied
            for this, or his other Preferments,
            because every one knew
            his merits,
            the only cause of his promotion. Into this
            Living
            he was
            no sooner
            Instituted
            and Inducted,
            but he took
            care for the Service of God to be
            constantly
            performed
            by reading
            the Common Prayers
            in his Church every Morning, that
            gave
            great satisfaction to the Parish,
            being
            a populous Market Town; and for the Communion Table, where the
            blessed
            Sacrament is
            Consecrated,
            he ordered
            that it should be placed
            according
            to ancient custom, at the East end of the Chancel, and
            railed
            about decently,
            to prevent base and profane usages;
            and where the Chancel wanted
            any thing of repairs,
            or the Church it self, both to be
            amended.</p>
          <p>Having
            thus shewed
            his care first for the House of God, to set it in good order,
            the next work followed,
            was
            to make his own dwelling
            House a fit and convenient Habitation; that to the old
            Building he added
            a new one, which was
            far more graceful, and made
            thereto a Chappel
            next to the Dining-room,
            that was
            beautified
            and adorned
            with silk Hangings
            about the Altar; in which Chappel,
            himself or his Curate read Morning and Evening Prayer to the
            Family, calling
            in his Labourers
            and Workfolks,
            for he was
            seldom without them
            while he liv'd, saying,
            that he loved
            the noise of a Work-mans
            hammer: for he thought it a deed of Charity, as well as to
            please his own fancy, by often building 
            repairing,
            to set poor People a work, and encourage painful
            Artificers
            and Tradesmen
            in their honest Callings.
            Yet after his death, his Eldest
            Son was
            sued
            for Dilapidations
            in the Court of <hi>Arches,</hi>
            by Dr. <hi>Beamont,</hi> his Fathers
            Successor; but the ingenious Gentleman
            pleaded
            his cause so notably,
            before Sir <hi>Giles Swet,</hi> then Judge of the Court, that
            he was
            discharged;
            there being
            no reason or justice he should be
            troubled
            for Dilapidations,
            occasioned
            by the long War, when his Father
            was
            unjustly
            turn'd out of his House and Living.</p>
          <p>
            In <hi>July</hi> 1630. he took
              his Degree of Batchelor
              in Divinity. His Latin Sermon was
              upon these words,
              <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Facim vos fieri piscatores
            
            
            hominum.</hi> Upon the <hi>Sunday</hi>
              following,
              being
              the time of the Act, he Preach'd in the Afternoon on
              <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25.
          </p>
          <p>In <hi>Feb.</hi>
            13. A. D. 1633. He took
            his Degree of Dr. in Divinity, an
            honour not usually
            in those days
            conferr'd upon men
            of such green years,
            but our young Doctor verified
            those excellent words
            of the Son of <hi>Syrach, That honourable Age
            is
            not that which standeth in length of time, nor that
            is
            measured
            by number of years,
            but Wisdom is
            the grey unto men,
            and an
            unspotted
            life is
            an
            old Age,</hi> Wisd. 4.8, 9. He entertain'd some
            hopes
            that Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> his animosities
            in so long a Tract of time, as from 1627. to 1633. might have
            cooled.
            In his first Disputation he had
            insisted
            on the Churches
            Visibility, and now he resolved
            to assert and establish its
            Authority, and
            to that purpose made
            choice to answer for his Degree upon these three
            questions,
            <hi>viz.</hi></p>
          <list>
            <item><hi>An
              Ecclesia habeat Authoritatem In determinandis fidei
              controversus.</hi></item>
            <item><hi>An
              Ecclesia habeat Authoritatem Interpretandi S.
              scripturas.</hi></item>
            <item><hi>An
              Ecclesia habeat Authoritatem Decernendi Ritus 
              Caeremonias.</hi></item>
          </list>
          <p>
            All which he held
              in the Affirmative, according
              to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the
              20th. Article. But Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
              was
              as little pleased
              with these questions,
              and the Respondents
              stating
              of them
              as he was
              with the former. And therefore to create unto the Respondent
              a greater
              <hi>odium,</hi> he openly
              declared
              that the Respondent had
              falsified
              the publick
              Doctrine of the Church, and changed
              the Article with that sentence,
              <hi>viz. Habet Ecclesia ritus sive caeremonias,</hi> c.
              which was
              not to be found in the whole body of it; and for the proof
              thereof, he read the Article out of a Book which lay before
              him,
              beginning
              thus, <hi>Non licet Ecclesiae quicquam instituere quod verbo
              Dei scripto adversetur,</hi> c. To which the Respondent
              readily
              answered,
              That he perceived
              by the bigness
              of the Book, which lay on the Doctors
              Cushion, that he had
              read that Article out of the harmony of
              Confessions,
              published
              at <hi>Geneva,</hi> A. D. 1612. which therein
              followed
              the Edition of the Articles
              in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <hi>A.D.</hi> 1552.
              in which that sentence was
              not found, but that it was
              otherwise in the Articles
              agreed
              on in the Convocation, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1562. The Respondent
              caused
              the Book of Articles
              to be sent
              for out of the Book-sellers
              shop, which being
              observed
              by the Doctor, he declared
              himself very willing to decline any further prosecution of
              that particular. But Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              was
              resolved
              to proceed on no further, <hi>Usquedum
              liberaverit
              animam suam ab ista calumnia,</hi> as his own
              words
              were.
              At the coming
              in of the Book, the Respondent read the Article in the
              English Tongue, <hi>viz. The Church
              hath
              power to decree Rites
              and Ceremonies,
              and Authority in Controversies
              of Faith,</hi> c. Which done,
              he delivered
              the Book to one of the Standers
              by, who desired
              it of him,
              the Book passing
              from one hand to another, till all
              men
              were
              satisfied.
              The <hi>Regius</hi> Professor
              had
              no other subterfuge but this, He
              went
              to prove that not the Convocation, but the High Court of
              Parliament had
              power of ordering
              matters
              in the Church, in making
              Canons,
              ordaining
              Ceremonies,
              and determining
              Controversies
              in Religion. And he could find no other medium to make it
              good, but the Authority of Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in one
              of the Books
              of his Reports.
              An
              Argument that Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              gratified
              with no better answer than, <hi>Non Credendum est cuique
              extra suam artem.</hi> For these
              things,
              and the Professors
              ill words
              in the former Disputation, Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              caused
              him
              to be brought
              before the Council Table at
            
            
            
            <hi>Woodstock,</hi> where he was
              publickly
              reprehended.
              And upon the coming
              out of the Kings
              Declaration concerning
              lawful sports,
              Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              translated
              the <hi>Regius</hi> Professors
              Lecture upon the Sabbath into English; and
              putting
              a Preface before it, caused
              it to be Printed;
              a performance which did
              not only justifie
              his Majesties
              proceedings,
              but took
              off much of that opinion, which Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
              had
              amongst the Puritanical Faction in those
              days.
          </p>
          <p><hi>A. D.</hi> 1634. The grievances
            which the Collegiate Church of <hi>Westminster</hi>
            suffered
            under the Government of <hi>John</hi> Lord Bishop of
            <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then Commendatory Dean thereof,
            became
            so intolerable, that Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
            with Dr. <hi>Tho. Wilson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gabriel Moor,</hi> and
            Dr. <hi>Lud. Wemys,</hi> with other of the
            Prebends,
            drew
            up a Charge of no less than 36 Articles
            against the Bishop, and by way of complaint
            humbly
            Petitioned
            his Majesty for redress
            of these grievances.
            Whereupon a Commission was
            issued
            out to the Arch-Bishops
            of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Earl of
            <hi>Manchester,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> the Lord
            Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the two
            Secretaries
            of State; Authorizing
            them
            to hold a Visitation of the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi> to
            examine the particular Charges
            made
            against <hi>John</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who
            afterwards
            calling
            the Prebends
            to meet him
            in the <hi>Jerusalem</hi>-Chamber,
            desired
            to know of them
            what these things
            were,
            that were
            amiss, that so he might presently
            redress them.
            But to that Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            replied,
            that seeing
            they had
            put the business into his Majesties
            hands,
            it would but ill become them,
            to take the matters
            out of his into their own. Amongst other
            grievances,
            the Bishop had
            most disgracefully
            turned
            out the Prebends
            of the great Seat or Pew under the Pulpit. Dr.
            <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            being
            chosen
            Advocate for his Brothren, did
            prove before the Lord Commissioners
            the Right of Sitting
            there. 1. The Prebends
            Original Right. 2. Their Derivative Right; and
            lastly,
            their Possessory Right. Upon hearing
            the proofs
            on both sides,
            it was
            ordered
            by general consent of the Lord Commissioners.
            That the Prebends
            should be restored
            to their old Seat, and that none should sit there with
            them
            but Lords
            of the Parliament, and Earls
            eldest
            Sons,
            according
            to the ancient custom. After this, there
            was
            no Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to be
            seen
            at any Morning-Prayer, and seldom at Evening.</p>
          <p>At this time came
            out the Doctor's <hi>History of the Sabbath,</hi> the
            Argumentative
            or Scholastick
            part of which subject was
            referred
            to <hi>White</hi> Bishop of <hi>Eli,</hi> the Historical part
            to the Doctor. And no sooner
            had
            the Doctor perfected
            his Book of the Sabbath, but the Dean of <hi>Peterborough</hi>
            engages
            him
            to answer the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Letter to the Vicar
            of <hi>Grantham.</hi> He received
            it upon good <hi>Friday;</hi> and by the <hi>Thursday</hi>
            following
            discovered
            the sophistry, mistakes,
            and falshoods
            of it. It was
            approved
            by the King, and by him
            given
            to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to be Licens'd and Publish'd
            under the title of <hi>a Coal from the Altar.</hi> In less
            than a twelve-month the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> writ
            an
            Answer to it, Entituled
            <hi>The Holy Table, Name, and Thing;</hi> but
            pretended
            that it was
            writ long ago by a Minister in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> against
            Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> a Divine in the
            days
            of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            receiv'd a Message from the King to return a reply to it, and
            not in the least to spare him.
            And he did
            it in the space of seven weeks,
            presenting
            it ready Printed
            to his Majesty, and called
            it <hi>Antidotum Lincolniense.</hi> But before this, he
            answered
            Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi>
            Seditious Sermon, being
            thereunto also appointed
            by the King.</p>
          <p>
            In <hi>July</hi> 1637. the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>
              was
              censured
              in the Star-Chamber, for tampering
              with Witnesses
              in the Kings
              Cause; suspended
               <hi>Beneficio 
            
            
            officio,</hi> and sent
              to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he
              continued
              three years,
              and did
              not in all that space of time hear either Sermon or
              publick
              Prayers.
          </p>
          <p>The College of <hi>Westminster,</hi> about this time,
            presented
            the Doctor to the Parsonage of <hi>Islip,</hi> now void by the
            death of Dr. <hi>King.</hi> By reason of
            its
            great distance from <hi>Alresford,</hi> the Doctor
            exchanged
            it for <hi>Southwarnborough,</hi>
            that was
            more near and convenient. At which time,
            recovering
            from an
            ill fit of Sickness, he studiously
            set on writing
            the History of the Church of <hi>England</hi> since the
            Reformation; in order to which he
            obtained
            the freedom of Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi>
            Library, and by Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s commendation,
            had
            liberty granted
            him
            to carry home some of the Books,
            leaving
            200 <hi>l.</hi> as a Pawn behind
            him.
            The Commotions
            in <hi>Scotland</hi> now began,
            and the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
            intending
            to set out an
            Apology for vindicating
            the Liturgy which he had
            commended
            to that Kirk, desired
            the Doctor to translate the Scottish Liturgy into Latin, that
            being
            Published
            with the Apology, all the World might be
            satisfied
            in his Majesties
            piety, as well as the Arch-Bishops
            care; as also that the perverse and rebellious temper of the
            <hi>Scots</hi>
            might be apparent
            to all, who would raise such troubles
            upon the Recommendation of a book that
            was
            so Venerable and Orthodox. Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            undertook
            and went
            through with it, but the distemper and trouble of those
            times
            put a period to the undertaking,
            and the Book went
            no farther than the hands
            of that Learned
            Martyr.</p>
          <p>In <hi>Feb.</hi>
            1639. the Doctor was
            put into Commission of Peace for the County of
            <hi>Hampshire,</hi> residing
            then upon this Living;
            into which place he was
            no sooner
            admitted,
            but he occasioned
            the discovery of a horrid Murther
            that had
            been
            committed
            many years
            before in that Countrey.
            In the <hi>April</hi> following
            he was
            chosen
            Clerk of the Convocation for the College of
            <hi>Westminster,</hi> at which time the Arch-Bishop of
            <hi>Canterbury</hi> sending
            a Canon to them
            for suppressing
            the farther growth of Popery, and
            reducing
            Papists
            to the Church, our Doctor moved
            his Grace that the Canon might be
            enlarged
            for the Peoples
            farther satisfaction, as well as the
            Churches
            benefit; what was
            done
            therein, and many other notable
            things
            by that Convocation, may be seen
            at large in the History of the Arch-Bishops
            Life. <hi>Friday</hi> being
            <hi>May</hi> the 29th. the Canons
            were
            formally
            subscribed
            unto by the Bishops
            and Clergy, no one dissenting
            except the Bishop
            of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
            who afterward turn'd Papist and
            died
            in the Communion of the Romish Church, and
            was
            all that time of his Life, in which he
            revolted
            from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a very great Servant of
            <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi>
            unto whom
            he dedicated
            some of his Books.
            But for his Contumacy in refusing
            to subscribe the Articles,
            he was
            voted
            worthy of Suspension in the Convocation, and
            was
            actually
            Suspended
            by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> which
            being
            done
            the Convocation was
            ended.</p>
          <p>
            In <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. <hi>A.D.</hi> 1640.
              began
              the Session of the long Parliament,
              At the opening
              of which, a general Rumor was
              spread abroad that Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              was
              run away for fear of an
              approaching
              storm that was
              like to fall upon his head, as well as on his Grace the
              Arch-Bishop of <hi>Cauterbury;</hi> but he who
              was
              ever of an
              undaunted spirit would not pusillanimously
              desert the Cause of the King and Church then in question,
              but speedily
              hastned
              up to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Alresford,</hi> to confute
              the common calumny and false report
              raised
              on him
              by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, that he
              appeared
              the next day in his Gown and Tippet at
              <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and in the Church with the
              accustomed
              formalities
              of his Cap, Hood and
            
            
            
            Surplice, employed
              then his Pen boldly
              in defence of the Bishops
              Rights,
              when the Lords
              began
              to shake the Hierarchy, in passing
              a Vote, <hi>That no Bishop should be of the
              Committe
              for Examination of the Earl of</hi> Strafford,
              being
              <hi>Causa sanguinis;</hi> upon which the Doctor
              drew
              up a brief and excellent Discourse,
              entituled
              <hi>De jure paritatis Episcopum,</hi> wherein he
              asserted
              all the Bishops
              Rights
              of Peerage, and principally
              of this as well as the rest, <hi>That they ought to sit in
              that Committee,</hi> with other
              Priviledges
              and Rights
              maintained
              by him,
              which either by Law or ancient custom
              did
              belong unto them.
              A rare Commendation at this juncture of time, for which the
              Doctor is
              to be admired,
              that he could command his Parts
              and Pen of a sudden, to write on this subject, or any other,
              if there was
              need, that did
              conduce to the publick
              good, and above all, make a quick dispatch in
              accomplishing
              what he had
              once undertaken
              and begun.
          </p>
          <p>But for those quick dispatches
            the Doctor afterward endured
            many tedious waitings
            at the backs
            of men
            in that Parliament, especially
            in the business of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> about his
            <hi>Histriomastix,</hi> for which he
            was
            kept
            four days
            under examination, because he had
            furnished
            the Lords
            of the Privy Council with matters
            out of that Book, which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi>
            alledged
            was
            the cause of all his sufferings.
            Great hopes
            had
            the Committee by his often dancing
            attendance after them,
            to sift the Doctor if they could gather any thing by his
            speeches,
            whether the Arch-Bishop had
            moved
            him
            to draw up those exceptions
            against <hi>Pryns</hi> Book, which he
            denied,
            or at least was
            not bound
            to confess; that as he was
            faithful to his Sovereign, so he would never prove himself
            unfaithful to his chief Minister both in Church and State.</p>
          <p>But now <hi>John</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> at
            this Session of Parliament, returned
            from the <hi>Tower</hi> to the Church (after so long a time of
            his Suspension
            and Indevotion) to say his Prayers,
            and hear his Brother <hi>Peter Heylyn</hi>
            Preach in his course at the Abby
            in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where notwithstanding
            the Holiness of that place, (to which his Lordship
            had
            no regard or
            reverence, but only to the Name and Thing of it) he
            was
            resolved
            publickly
            to revenge himself for old-done
            deeds
            that ought to have been
            forgotten,
            by disturbing
            the Doctor in his Sermon, before all the Congregation,
            contrary to the Laws
            of this Realm, and with Reverence
            to his Lordship, against all good
            manners,
            and the common rules
            of civility.</p>

          <p>
            Strange! That a Bishop could not rule his
              passions
              for one hour, when no provocation
              was
              given
              by the Doctor, whose Sermon from the
              beginning
              to the end of it, throughout the whole discourse
              was
              pacificatory, exhorting
              Christians
              to Moderation, Love, and Charity among themselves, for the
              preservation of the publique
              peace, although they differed
              in some opinions.
              For satisfaction of the Reader, I will set down the
              Doctors
              own words,
              <hi>viz. Is
              it not that we are so affected
              with our own Opinions,
              that we condemn whosoever shall opine the contrary; and so
              far wedded
              to our own wills,
              that when we have espoused
              a quarrel, neither the Love of God, not the God of Love
              shall divorce us from it: Instead of
              hearkning
              to the voice of the Church, every man
              hearkens
              to himself, and cares
              not if the whole miscarry, so that himself may
              bravely
              carry out his own devices.
              Upon which stubborn height of Pride, what
              quarrels
              have been
              rais'd, what Schisms
              in every
            
            
            corner of this our Church (to enquire
              no further) some rather putting
              all into open tumult, than that they would conform to a
              Lawful Government, derived
              from Christ and his Apostles
              to these very Times.</hi>
              At the speaking
              of which words,
              the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> sitting
              in the great Pew (which was
              before the Seat of Contention) knocked
              aloud with his Staff upon the Pulpit,
              saying,
              <hi>No more of that point, No more of that point,</hi>
              Peter: To whom
              the Doctor readily
              answered,
              without haesitation,
              or the least sign of being
              dashed
              out of countenance, I have a little more to say, my Lord,
              and then I have done,
              which was
              as followeth,
              <hi>viz. Others combining
              into close and dangerous Factions,
              because some points
              of speculative Divinity, are otherwise
              maintained
              by some than they would have them.
              Also regardless of the common peace, that rather than be
              quiet, we will quarrel with our
              blessed
              Peace-maker for seeking
              to compose the differences,
              though to the prejudice of neither party. Thus do we
              foolishly
              divide our Saviour, and rent his Sacred Body on the least
              occasion, vainly
              conceiving
              that a difference in point of Judgment,
              must needs
              draw after it a dis-joyning
              of the affections
              also, and that conclude at last in
              an
              open Schism. Whereas diversity of
              opinions,
              if wisely
              managed,
              would rather tend to the discovery of the Truth, than the
              disturbance of the Church, and rather whet-our Industry than
              excite our passions.
              It was
              St.</hi> Cyprians
              <hi>resolution,</hi> Neminem, licet aliter senserit,
               Communione
              amovere, <hi>not to suspend any man from the Communion of
              the Church, although the matter then
              debated,
              was
              (as I take it) of more weight than any of the
              points
              now controverted;
              which moderation, if the present Age
              had
              attained
              unto, we had
              not then so often torn
              the Church in pieces,
              nor by our frequent broils
              offered
              that injury and inhumanity to our
              Saviours
              Body, which which was
              not offered
              to his Garments.</hi>
              At this, and all the other part of his Sermon, the Auditory
              was
              highly
              pleased,
              but the Bishop in so great wrath, that his voice, and the
              noise of his Pastoral Staff (if I may so call it)
              had
              like to have frighted
              the whole Flock or Congregation out of the Fold.
              Considering
              the ill posture of affairs
              in which the Nation then stood,
              overflowing
              with Seditions
              and Schisms,
              I think a more seasonable Sermon could not have
              been
              Preached
              than to move men
              of different persuasions
              unto Peace and Unity one with another, which
              is
              a most Christian Doctrine. After the Sermon
              was
              ended,
              he took
              Sir <hi>Robert Filmore</hi> his
              Learned
              Friend, with some Gentlemen
              of Quality that were
              his Auditors,
              out of the Church along with him
              to his House, where he immediately
              Sealed
              up the Book that contained
              this Sermon, and other Notes,
              to which they also set their Seals,
              that so there might not be the least
              alteration
              made
              in the Sermon, nor any ground to suspect it, which
              was
              presently
              after sent
              to the Bishop, who kept
              it in his hands
              for some days;
              in which time his passions
              allayed,
              being
              more calm at home than in Church, he
              sent
              the Book untouched back again to Dr.
              <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
              in whose Study it had
              lain
              dormant for the space of fifteen
              years,
              (when the danger of an
              old Sermon, of being
              called
              in question, must needs
              be over) by my persuasion, and his consent, he
              was
              pleased
              to give me leave to open that Apocalyptical Book, that I
              might read and see the mystery that lay
              hid
              under the Seals
              for so many years,
              which indeed proved
              only a pious and practical Sermon for Edification, to
              moderate the heats
              of those fiery spirits
              that were
              like to make a Combustion in the whole Kingdom. The Bishop
              deserved
              a sharper rebuke for his own Sermon, which about that time
              he Preached
              before the King, when he made
              a strange Apostrophe from his Text to the Sabbath,
              falling
              down upon his knees
              in the Pulpit at the middle of his Sermon,
              beseeching
              his Majesty in most humble manner,
            
            
            
            that greater
              care might be taken
              for the better observation of the Sabbath day, which
              was
              looked
              upon by many as a piece of most grand
              Hypocrisie,
              who knew
              his opinion well by his practice; for he
              did
              ordinarily
              play at Bowls
              on Sundays,
              after Evening Service, shoot with Bow and
              Arrows,
              and used
              other exercises
              and recreations
              according
              to his Lordships
              pleasure. The
              Bishop restored
              to his Dignities
              by means
              of that unhappy Parhament,
              with whom
              he was
              in high favour, expected
              that the Doctor should have submitted
              himself to his Lordship, and particularly
              acknowledge
              his error in putting
              out the <hi>Antidotum Lincolniense,</hi> which he
              commanded
              him
              to call in; to which Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              replied,
              that he received
              his Majesties
              Royal Command for the Writing
              and Printing
              of that Book, in which he had
              asserted
              nothing but what he was
              still ready to justifie
              and defend against the opposers
              of it.
          </p>
          <p>No sooner
            was
            the Doctor out of the Pulpit, but he must come again before
            the Chair of the old Committee, to Answer unto new
            Articles
            that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had
            drawn
            up against him;
            more especially
            for a Sermon that he had
            Preached
            many years
            ago, which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> (who
            had
            then Ears)
            heard
            himself, and brought
            along with him
            some other Auditors,
            who were
            a company of Butchers,
            to give Evidence against the Doctor,
            supposing
            he would come bloodily
            off; but contrary to their expectation, he
            got
            the victory of the day, and was
            dismissed
            with a <hi>Quietus est</hi> from that Committee. And glad
            was
            he so to be delivered
            out of the Lyons mouth, telling
            his Friends
            that he would now go to <hi>Alresford,</hi> with a
            purpose never
            more to come back to <hi>Westminster,</hi> whilst these two
            good Friends
            of his abode in it, <hi>viz.</hi> The House of Common, and the
            Lord of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> Accordingly
            he hastned
            down to his Family and Parishioners,
            to solace his soul with peace, after his so long patience
            under <hi>Westminster</hi> troubles.</p>
          <p>
            Welcome was
              he to his Parishioners,
              who always
              loved
              him
              in the time of his Prosperity and Adversity, because of his
              affable and courteous behaviour,
              his Hospitality among them,
              and Relief to their Poor; his readiness
              to do his Neighbours
              any kindness by Counsel or other assistance; his constant
              Preaching,
              during all time of his abode; and in his absence, when he
              was
              called
              to Court, supplied
              them
              with an
              able Curate; he was
              resolved
              now to spend his days
              among them,
              and his Parishioners
              at <hi>South-Warnborough,</hi> from
              whom
              he had
              the same respect and love. But the unhappy
              Wars
              now following,
              that put all things
              into disorder and confusion,
              dispersed
              Families,
              parted
              nearest
              Relations,
              forced
              People from their Houses,
              and Ministers
              out of their Churches,
              necessitated
              him
              to flie
              for his own Preservation, as <hi>Elijah</hi>
              Persecuted
              by <hi>Ahab,</hi> being
              sent
              for by a party of Horse, under the command of Sir
              <hi>William Waller,</hi> to bring
              him
              Prisoner to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> he
              fairly
              escaped
              their hands,
              but continually
              disturb'd with new Alarms
              of Drums
              and Trumpets
              sounding
              about him,
              and every where else, that he could find no other way of
              safety like going
              to <hi>Oxford,</hi> there to take Sanctuary with his
              Brethren (the persecuted
              Clergy.) But the news
              of his being
              in <hi>Oxford,</hi> took
              wings
              to the old Committee, who forthwith
              Voted
              him
              a Delinquent,
              and sent
              down an
              Order for Sequestration of all his
              Goods
              and Chattels:
              And first they fetcht
              away his Library (for they thought he
              was
              too great a Scholar) the plunder of which he
              took
              deeply
              to heart, and over accounted
              it the greatest
              of his losses.
              The Books
              were
              carried
              to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where they
              were
              appraised
              at a thousand pound, and put into a
              publick
              Library, from whence they could never be
              redeemed.
              After
            
            
            the loss of them,
              those <hi>Sabeans</hi> drove away his
              Goods
              and Chattels,
              seized
              upon his Corn and Hay, and in Carts
              and Waggons
              carried
              away his Houshold
              goods,
              that they left him
              naked as <hi>Job;</hi> for immediately
              by order of the Committe,
              the Tiths of both his Livings
              were
              Sequestred,
              and the profits
              of his Prebendary in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and what temporal
              Estate he had
              within their reach, taken
              from him;
              that being
              asked
              by one of his acquaintance, how he
              lived?
              he answered
              him
              readily,
              <hi>By Horseflesh
              and old Leather;</hi> which seeming
              a Riddle, he explained
              afterward his meaning,
              <hi>That he saved
              only his Coach and Horses
              which brought
              him
              to</hi> Oxford, <hi>which he was
              forc'd to sell, and live upon the money.</hi> But that
              being
              done,
              he must think of some other way, first to live upon Credit,
              which seldom holdeth
              long, without an
              Estate to support it; and afterward
              upon the Charity of Friends,
              which is
              shorter
              liv'd, for the heat of that love soon
              groweth
              cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that being
              no longer
              able to maintain himself and Family in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he
              sent
              his Wife to <hi>London,</hi> to get what money she could
              amongst her Relations:
              himself went
              out of <hi>Oxford</hi> A. D. 1645.
              walking
              as a poor Traveller
              through the Countrey,
              and disguis'd both in his Name and Habit; he
              somtimes
              went
              under the name of <hi>Barker,</hi> at other
              times
              took
              the name of <hi>Harding,</hi> by which he
              was
              well known
              among his Friends,
              and not discovered
              by his Enemies;
              his Habit changed
              from a Priest to a Lay-man, and in the likeness
              usually
              of an
              honest Country-man, or else of a poor
              decayed
              Gentleman, as indeed he was.
              The peril of the times
              made
              him
              such a <hi>Proteus</hi> in his Garb, because the Parliament
              was
              resolved,
              if they could take him,
              that he should follow his good Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
              to another
              World, than that described
              in his Cosmography; but he happily
              outlived
              most of them,
              and died
              in honour, which they did
              not. He wandred
              like a Jew, with a Groat in his purse, and
              somtimes
              without it, till he got
              to some good Friends
              House. At his first setting
              out, he was
              betrayed
              by a zealous She-<hi>Puritan,</hi> one Mrs.
              <hi>Munday,</hi>
              at her House in <hi>Oxfordshire;</hi> her Husband
              was
              a true-hearted
              Cavalier, unto whose protection
              he committed
              himself: He being
              one day gone
              from home, she Saint-like, unfaithful to her Husband and his
              Friend, sent
              Intelligence to some Parliament
              Soldiers,
              that there was
              a Cavalier-Doctor in her House; of which he
              had
              notice given
              him
              by two of her Husbands
              Sisters,
              who hated
              her pure qualities;
              that as soon as the Family was
              all in Bed, he went
              out at a back door, down a pair of
              Garden-stairs,
              from whence he took
              his march all that Night, and by the help of God Almighty,
              he got
              safely
              to another Friends
              House by Morning. Ever after, the Doctor
              observed
              it for a rule, never to come within the
              doors
              of a Holy Sister, whose House may be
              compared
              to that which <hi>Solomon</hi> describeth,
              <hi>Is
              the way to Hell, going
              down to the Chambers
              of death;</hi> that had
              not Divine Providence protected
              him
              from the treachery of that Woman, he
              had
              fallen
              into the hands
              of those <hi>Nimrods</hi> that hunted
              after his Life. From place to place he
              shifted
              like the old Travels
              of the Patriarchs;
              and in pity to his necessity, found a hearty entertainment
              amongst his Friends
              of the Royal party, at whose Tables
              he was
              fed,
              for he had
              none of his own: His Children
              disposed
              of into several Friends
              hands,
              his Wife among her Relations,
              himself depending
              upon the Courtesie,
              both of Friends
              and Strangers,
              till he grew
              weary and tired
              out with this kind of life, for <hi>Vilis amicorum annona
              est,</hi> it pleased
              God to send him
              afterward some supplies
              of moneys,
              that he setled
              himself, Wife and eldest
              Daughter at <hi>Winchester,</hi> in the House of a right
              honest man, one Mr. <hi>Lizard,</hi> with
              whom
              they
            
            
            
            Tabled
              a good while, where he had
              a comfortable time of breathing
              and rest after his former troubles,
              and to his hearts
              delight the sweet enjoyment
              and conversation of Loyal persons;
              for <hi>Winchester</hi> was
              then a strong Garrison for the King, and
              being
              near <hi>Alresford,</hi> he would go
              somtimes
              in disguise to visit his old Neighbors,
              who he knew
              were
              true and faithful to him.
              But those <hi>Halcion</hi>
              days
              quickly
              vanished,
              as seldom Prosperity continues
              so long a time as Adversity; for that Town and Castle
              especially,
              which was
              thought strong enough to resist a
              greater
              Force than came
              against it, were
              both treacherously
              delivered
              up to the hands
              of their Enemies
              in three days
              time; and now every House full of
              Soldiers
              quartered
              amongst them,
              poor Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              was
              in more danger than ever, had
              not Mr. <hi>Lizard</hi> taken
              care of him
              as his dearest
              Guest, and hid
              him
              in a private Room, as Providence
              ordained,
              to save his life; which Room formerly
              was
              supposed
              to be made
              for the hiding
              of Seminary Priests
              and Jesuits,
              because the House heretofore belonged
              to a Papist Family; and indeed
              it was
              so cunningly
              contrived,
              that there was
              no door to be seen,
              nor entring
              into it, but behind an
              old Beds
              head; and if the Bed had
              not been
              there, the door was
              so neatly
              made
              like the other Wainscot of the Chamber, that it
              was
              impossible for a Stranger to find it out: in which Room,
              instead of a Papist, a right Protestant Doctor, who
              was
              a professed
              Enemy both to Popery and Puritanism,
              was
              now secured
              from the rage and violence of the
              Soldiers,
              who sought
              after him
              with no less eagerness, than if he
              had
              been
              a Heretick,
              followed
              by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, when he good man
              was
              in the very next Room to them,
              adjoyning
              to the Dining-chamber,
              where he could hear all their raillery and mirth, their
              gaming
              at Cards
              and Dice; for those idle <hi>Lurdanes</hi>
              spent
              their time only in riot and pleasure at home, and when they
              went
              abroad, they would tread the Maze near the Town. He
              took
              his opportunity on the Market-day to put on his
              travelling
              robes,
              with a long Staff in his hand, and so
              walked
              out of the Town confidently,
              with the Country croud,
              bidding
              adieu to the little Room that he left for the next
              distressed
              Gentleman; in the mean while his Wife and Daughter he
              entrusted
              to Mr. <hi>Lizard</hi>'s care, his faithful Friend. And now
              he must again travel to seek his Fortune, which
              proved
              more kind to him,
              than she did
              before; yet he met
              with a hard Adventure not many miles
              from <hi>Winchester,</hi> where some
              stragling
              Soldiers
              lighting
              on him,
              and catching
              hold of his hand, felt
              a Ring under his
              Glove, which through hast
              of his escape, he forgot
              to pull off; which no sooner
              discover'd, but they roughly
              swore
              he was
              some Runaway
              Cavalier: the Ring being
              hard to get off, the poor Doctor
              willingly
              helped
              them;
              in which time came
              galloping
              by some of the Parliaments,
              Scouts,
              who said
              to their Fellow-soldiers,
              <hi>Look to your selves,
              the Cavaliers
              are coming;</hi>
              at which words
              being
              affrighted,
              they took
              that little money that was
              in his Pocket, and so rid away without further search, and
              he good man jog'd on to the next
              Friends
              House, with some pieces
              of Gold that he had
              hid
              in his high Shooes,
              which if the Rogues
              had
              not been
              so hastily
              frighted
              away, would have been
              undoubtedly
              found, and might have cost him
              his life by further suspicions
              of him.
              At what Friends
              House he was
              now secured
              from danger, though I have heard
              him
              named,
              indeed I have forgot,
              but from thence he travelled
              to Dr. <hi>Kingsmill,</hi> a Loyal person of great worth,
              an
              ancient Family, where he continued,
              and sent
              for his Wife and Daughter from <hi>Winchester</hi> to
              him;
              and from thence removed
              to <hi>Minster Lovel</hi> (in <hi>Oxfordshire</hi>) the
              pleasant Seat of his Elder Brother, in the year 1648. which
              he Farmed
              of his Nephew Colonel
            
            
            <hi>Heylyn,</hi>
              for six years:
              Being
              deprived
              of his Ecclesiastical preferments,
              he must think of some honest way for a Livelihood.
          </p>
          <p>Yet not withstanding
            he followed
            his Studies,
            in which was
            his chief delight; for though the Usurp'd
            Powers
            had
            silenced
            his Tongue from Preaching,
            they could not with-hold his Pen from
            Writing,
            and that in an
            acute and as sharp a style as formerly.
            At the same time he enlarged
            his Book of <hi>Geography</hi> into a large Folio, which
            was
            before but a little Quarto, and
            entituled
            it with the name of <hi>Cosmography;</hi> of which it may be
            truly
            said,
            it does
            contain a World of Learning
            in it, as well as the Description
            of the World; and particularly
            sheweth
            the Authors
            most excellent abilities,
            not only in History and smoothness of
            its
            style, that maketh
            the whole Book delightful to the Reader; but in Chronology,
            Genealogy, and Heraldry, in which last any one may see that he
            could blazon the Arms,
            and describe the descent and pedigree of the
            greatest
            Families
            in <hi>Europe.</hi> In which pleasing
            study while he spent
            his time, his good Wife, a discreet and active Lady,
            looked
            both after her Housewifery within
            doors,
            and the Husbandry without; thereby
            freeing
            him
            from that care and trouble, which otherwise would have
            hindred
            his laborious Pen from going
            through so great a work in that short time. And yet he
            had
            several divertisements
            by company, which continually
            resorted
            to his House; for having
            (God be thanked)
            his temporal Estate cleared
            from Sequestration, by his Composition with the
            Commissioners
            at <hi>Goldsmiths-Hall,</hi>
            and this Estate which he Farmed
            besides,
            he was
            able to keep a good House, and relieve his poor Brethren, as
            himself had
            found relief from others Charity, that his House
            was
            the Sanctuary of Sequestred
            men,
            turn'd out of their Livings,
            and of several Ejected
            Fellows
            out of <hi>Oxford;</hi> more particularly
            of some worthy Persons
            which I can name, as Dr. <hi>Allibone,</hi> Mr.
            <hi>Levite,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ashwell,</hi>
            who would stay for two or three
            months
            at his House; or any other Acquaintance that
            were
            suffering
            men,
            he chearfully
            receiv'd them,
            and with a hearty Welcome might tarry as long as they
            pleased.
            A vertue
            highly
            to be prais'd, and most worthy of
            Commendation
            in it self. Mr. <hi>Marchamont Needham,</hi> then a zealous
            Loyalist, and scourge to the <hi>Rump</hi> Parliament,
            being
            violently
            pursued
            by them,
            was
            sheltered
            in the Doctors
            House while the storm was
            over: the good Doctor now as his Tutelary Angel,
            preserved
            him
            in a high Room, where he continued
            writing
            his <hi>Weekly Pragmaticus;</hi> yet he afterward like
            <hi>Balaam</hi> the Son of <hi>Beor,</hi>
            hired
            with the Wages
            of Unrighteousness, corrupted
            with mercenary gifts
            and bribes,
            became
            the only Apostate of the Nation,
            and writ for the pretended
            Common-wealth, or rather I may say, for a base
            <hi>Democracy;</hi> for which the Doctor could never after
            endure the mention of his name, who
            had
            so disobliged
            his Countrey,
            and the Royal Party, by his shameful Tergiversation.</p>
          <p>
            The good Doctors
              Charity also did
              not only extend it self to ancient
              Friends
              and Acquaintance, but to mere Strangers,
              by whom
              he had
              like to run himself into a praemunire; for word
              being
              carried
              to him
              in his Study, there was
              a Gentleman at the door, who said
              he was
              a Commander
              in the Kings
              Army, and earnestly
              desired
              some relief and harbour for that Night, and his Son with
              him;
              the Doctor presently
              went
              to him,
              and finding
              by his discourse, and other circumstances,
              what he said
              was
              true, received
              him
              into his House, and made
              him
              very Welcome: The Gentleman was
              a <hi>Scotch</hi> Captain, who having
              a <hi>Scotch Diurnal</hi> in his Pocket, they read it,
              fearing
              no harm thereby, but it proved
              otherwise; for one of the Doctors
              Servants
              listning
              at the door, went
              streight-way
              to
            
            
            
            <hi>Oxford,</hi> and informed
              the Governor,
              Colonel <hi>Kelsey,</hi> that his Master
              had
              received
              Letters
              from the King, whereupon the Governour
              sent
              a party of Horse to fetch him
              away. Strange news
              it was,
              knowing
              his own innocence,
              to hear that Soldiers
              had
              beset his House so early in the Morning, before he
              was
              out of bed: But go he must to appear before the
              Governour;
              and when he came,
              that treacherous Rogue his Man did
              confidently
              affirm that he heard
              the Letters
              read, and was
              sure he could remember the very
              words,
              if his Master would produce the
              Letters:
              upon which the Doctor relates
              the whole story to the Governour,
              and withal shews
              the <hi>Diurnal,</hi> which the
              Governor
              read to the Fellow; often asking
              him,
              is
              this right, is
              this the same you heard?
              to whom
              he answered,
              yes Sir, yes that is
              the very thing, and those words
              I remember: upon which the Governor
              caused
              him
              to be soundly
              whipt,
              instead of giving
              him
              a reward for Intelligence, and dismiss'd the Doctor, with
              some Complements,
              ordering
              the same party of Horse that fetcht
              him,
              to wait upon him
              home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being
              thus delivered
              from the Treachery of this Servant, his great care
              was
              to provide one more faithful; which the good Lady
              <hi>Wainman,</hi> his Neighbour,
              hearing
              of, commended
              to him
              one of her own Servants,
              whom
              Sir <hi>Francis</hi> her Husband
              had
              bred
              up from a Child, whose fidelity he need not fear in the
              worst of times,
              when a mans
              Enemies
              may be of his own Houshold,
              as <hi>Q. Vibius Serenus</hi> was
              betrayed
              by his own Son, <hi>Reus pater, accusator filius,</hi>
            
            <hi>idem index  testis,</hi>
              saith
              the Historian, <hi>The Son was
              both Accuser and Witness against the Father.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 1653. he removed
              to <hi>Lacies-Court</hi>
              in <hi>Abingdon,</hi> which Seat he
              bought
              for the pleasantness of its
              Situation, standing
              next the Fields,
              and not distant above five miles
              from <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he might be
              furnished
              with Books
              at his pleasure, either from the
              Book-sellers
              Shops,
              or the <hi>Bodleian</hi>-Library: for such a fresh appetite
              to Study and Writing
              he still retained
              in his old Age, that he would give his mind no time of
              vacancy and
              intermission for those labours
              in which he was
              continually
              exercised.
              When Monarchy and Episcopacy was
              trodden
              under foot, then did
              he stand up a Champion in defence of both, and
              feared
              not to Publish
              <hi>The Stumbling
              block of Disobedience,</hi> and his <hi>Certamen
              Epistolare;</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
              fled
              the Field, because there was
              <hi>impar congressus</hi> betwixt
              him,
              and as I may say an
              old Soldier of the Kings,
              who had
              been
              used
              to fiercer
              Combats
              with more famous <hi>Goliahs.</hi> Also Mr. <hi>Thomas
              Fuller</hi> was
              sufficiently
              chastized
              for his <hi>Church History,</hi> as he
              deserved
              a most sharp correction, because he
              had
              been
              a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of her
              prosperity, and now deserted
              her in her adverse fortune, and
              took
              to the Adversaries
              side: And it was
              then my hap, having
              some business with Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Fellow of
              <hi>Lincoln</hi> College in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and then Chaplain
              to the Lord Keeper, Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> to see
              Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> make a fawning
              address to my Lord, with his great Book of Church History
              hugged
              under his arm, which he presented
              to the Keeper after an
              uncouth rustical manner,
            
            as <hi>Horace</hi> describeth,---<hi>Sub ala fasciculum
              portas Librorum
              ut rusticus agnum.</hi> The many
              falsities,
              defects,
              and mistakes
              of that Book the Doctor discovered
              and refuted;
              of which Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> afterward
              being
              ingeniously
              ashamed,
              came
              to the Doctors
              House in <hi>Abingdon,</hi> where he
              made
              his peace; both became
              very good Friends,
              and betwixt them
              for the future was
              kept
              an
              inviolable bond of Friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 1656. he Printed
              some Observations
              upon the History of the Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> by
              <hi>H. L.</hi> Esq with whom
              he dealt
              very candidly,
              and modestly
              corrected
              some of his mistakes
              in most mild and
            
            
            amicable terms,
              telling
              him,
              <hi>viz. Between us both the History will be
              made
              more perfect, and consequently
              the Reader will be better satisfied,</hi>
            
            <hi>which makes
              me somewhat confident that these few
              Notes
              will be so far from making
              your History less vendible than it
              was
              before, that they will very much
              advantage and
              promote the sale: And if I can do good to all, without wrong
              to any, I hope no man can be offended
              with my pains
              and industry.</hi> In answer to which, Mr. <hi>Hammond
              L'Estrange</hi> led
              by his passion, and not by reason, fell upon the Doctor in
              such uncivil words,
              unbecoming
              a Gentleman, that as the Doctor
              saith,
              he never was
              accustomed
              to such <hi>Billinsgate</hi> language. <hi>There
              was
              indeed a time</hi> (saith
              he) <hi>when my name was
              almost in every Libel,</hi>
            
            <hi>which exercised
              the patience of the State for seven
              years
              together; and yet I dare confidently
              say, that all of them
              together did
              not vomit so much filth upon me, as
              hath
              proceeded
              from the mouth of the Pamphleter,
              whom
              I have in hand.</hi> Therefore the Doctor
              returned
              a quick and sharp reply in his Book,
              Entituled
              <hi>Extraneus Vapulans,</hi> wherein with
              admired
              wit and eloquence, he gave
              Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> a most severe, yet civil correction.
              In the year 1657. he put out in Print, <hi>Ecclesia
              Vindicata,</hi> or <hi>the Church of</hi> England
              <hi>justified,</hi>
              which he dedicated
              (as a grateful testimony of his mind) to his Master then
              living,
              Mr. <hi>Edward Davis,</hi> formerly
              School-master of <hi>Burford,</hi> and now Vicar of
              <hi>Shelton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> to
              whom
              he ever shewed
              a Love and Reverence: and had
              the Doctors
              power been
              answerable to his will and intention, he
              had
              design'd more considerable Preferments
              for him;
              but the sudden and unexpected alteration in his own
              affairs
              prevented,
              (so soon almost as himself was
              preferred)
              that he could shew
              no other specimen of his gratitude. What
              saith
              the Heathen? <hi>Diis parentibus  praeceptoribus non
              redditur aequivalens,</hi> An
              amends
              can never be made
              to God, our Parents
              and Tutors;
              and certainly
              he hath
              but little of a Christian
              in him,
              that can forget this lesson; yet some are so unnatural, as
              the Child that loveth
              not his Nurse.
          </p>
          <p>
            About the same time he was
              harassed
              before <hi>Olivers</hi>
              Major General, for the decimation of his Estate, he
              thinking
              there had
              been
              an
              end of those troubles,
              by compounding
              for his Estate in <hi>Goldsmiths</hi>-Hall,
              he argued
              his Case notably
              with them,
              but all in vain, for Arguments,
              though never so acutely
              handled,
              are obtuse weapons
              against the edge of the sword. One Captain <hi>Allen</hi>
              formerly
              a Tinker, and his Wife a poor Tripe-wife,
              took
              upon him
              to reprove the Doctor for maintaining
              his Wife so highly,
              like a Lady; to whom
              the Doctor roundly
              replied,
              <hi>That he had
              Married
              a Gentlewoman, and did
              maintain her according
              to her quality, and so might he his Tripe-wife:</hi>
              adding
              withal, that this rule he always
              observed,
              <hi>For his Wife to go above his Estate, his
              Children
              according
              to his Estate, and himself below his Estate,</hi> so that at
              the years
              end he could make all even. Soon after these
              things
              came
              out the Order for Decimation against
              him.
              Notwithstanding which, the Doctor, like the Palm-Tree,
              <hi>Crescit sub pondere virtus,</hi> the more he
              was
              press'd with those heavy loads,
              did
              flourish and grow up in his Estate, that through the
              blessing
              of God, being
              neither the subject of any mans
              envy, nor the object of their pitty,
              he lived
              in good Credit, and kept
              a noble House; for I my self, being
              often there, can say I have seldom
              seen
              him
              sit down at his Table without Company; for
              being
              nigh the University, some out of a desire to be
              acquainted
              with him,
              and others to visit their old Friend,
              whom
              they knew
              rarely
              could be seen
              but at Meals,
              made
              choice of that time to converse with
              him:
              And likewise his good Neighbours
              at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> whom
              he always
              made
              welcome, and was
              ready to assist them
              in their Parish-business, or upon any other occasion,
              particularly
              in upholding
            
            
            
            upholding
              the Church of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which otherwise would
              have been
              pulled
              down on pretence of uniting
              it to S. <hi>Ellens,</hi>
              but in truth to disable the sober Party of the Town, who
              were
              Loyal People, from enjoying
              their wonted
              Service and Worship of God in their own Parish Church, of
              which they had
              a Reverend and Orthodox Man, one Mr. <hi>Huish,</hi> their
              Minister; and in his absence, the Doctor
              took
              care to get them
              supplied
              with able men
              from <hi>Oxford.</hi> Great endeavors
              were
              on both sides,
              the one Party to preserve the Church, and the other to pull
              it down, because it was
              thronged
              with Malignants,
              who seduced
              others from their godly way, as Religion
              always
              hath
              been
              the pretence of factious minds,
              to draw on others to their Party,
            
            as one saith
              well. <hi>Sua quisque arma sancta praedicat, suam causam
              religiosam, Deus, pietas, cultus divinus praetexuntur:</hi>
              Every one proclaimeth
              their own quarrels
              to be be a Holy War; the Cause Religion, God, Godliness, and
              Divine worship must be pretended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several Journeys
              the Doctor took
              to <hi>London,</hi> sparing
              neither his pains
              nor purse in so pious a Cause; for the
              managing
              of which, he employed
              divers
              Solicitors,
              somtimes
              before Committees,
              at other times
              before <hi>Olivers</hi>
              Council, where it was
              carried
              dubiously,
              and rather inclining
              to the other side; at which the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>-Party
              made
              the Bells
              to be rung, and Bonfires
              in the Town to express their joy,
              triumphing
              in the ruin of a poor Church; but the day
              was
              not so clearly
              their own, as they imagined,
              for the Church yet stood
              against all its
              Enemies,
              God protecting
              his own House, and his Servants
              that were
              zealous for it, in a time when they could look for little
              favor
              from the Powers
              that then ruled,
              who had
              not so much respect for Gods
              House, as the Heathens
              had
              for their Idol Temples,
              and for those that Vindicated
              them,
            
            as <hi>Justin</hi> saith
              on this occasion, <hi>Diis proximus
              habetur per quem deorum majestas vindicata sit;</hi> for
              which he praiseth
              <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
              calling
              him
              <hi>Vindicem Sacrilegii, ultorem religionum,</hi> c.
              During those troubles,
              Mr. <hi>Huish,</hi> Minister of the Church,
              durst
              not go on in his Ministerial duties,
              which the Doctor no sooner
              heard
              of, but to animate
              and encourage him,
              he writ a pious Letter; a Copy of which I then
              transcribed,
              which is
              as followeth,
              and worth the inserting
              here.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>After this good Letter Mr. <hi>Huish</hi>
            went
            on in his prayers,
            as formerly,
            and this little Church withstood
            all the batteries
            and fierce assaults
            of its
            Enemies,
            who were
            never able to demolish it, or unite it to Saint
            <hi>Ellens.</hi>
            So well had
            the Doctor managed
            the business for the publick
            good and benefit of the Parish: for as to his own particular,
            he might have spared
            that pains
            and charge, having
            in his house an
            Oratory or little Chappel,
            which he built
            after his coming
            thither, where he had
            constant Prayers
            and Sacraments
            for his own Family, and some particular
            Neighbors
            who had
            a desire to hear the Service and receive the
            Sacrament
            according
            to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He
            was
            a strict keeper of <hi>Lent,</hi> save only
            <hi>Sundays,</hi>
            and an
            exact observer of the <hi>Holy-days.</hi>
            And as he was
            a strict observer of all the Rites
            and Orders
            of our Church, so he was
            a perfect abhorrer of Popery and <hi>Romish</hi>
            superstitions,
            in so much that he would not hold a correspondency with a
            Papist, or with one so reputed,
            as I can instance an
            example, of one Mr. <hi>Hood,</hi> whose Family and the
            Doctors
            were
            very kind, when he lived
            at <hi>Minster,</hi> being
            near Neighbors,
            the Gentleman afterward turning
            Papist, and coming
            to <hi>Abingdon</hi> to give him
            a Visit, the Doctor sent
            his man Mr. <hi>Gervis</hi> to him,
            to bid him
            be gone,
            and shut the doors
            against him,
            saying
            that he heard
            he was
            turn'd Papist, for which he hated
            the sight of him,
            and so my Gentleman went
            away, never daring
            to give him
            another Visit.</p>
          <p>In the Year 1658. he put forth <hi>Respondet Petrus</hi> or
            his Answer to Dr. <hi>Bernards</hi> Book
            entituled,
            <hi>The Judgment
            of the late Primate of</hi> Ireland, <hi>c.</hi> at the
            same time Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> who
            was
            before an
            <hi>Irish</hi> Dean, but was
            now Chaplain to <hi>Oliver,</hi> one of his
            Almoners,
            and Preacher in <hi>Grayes
            Inn,</hi> would have procured
            an
            Order from <hi>Olivers</hi>
            Privy Council not only for suppressing,
            but the burning
            of that Book, which caused
            a common report, that Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Book
            was
            publickly
            burnt; but it was
            a mistake, for the Book never saw
            either the Fire, or any Answer. At the same time the Doctor
            printed
            an
            Appendix to <hi>Respondet Petrus,</hi> in answer to certain
            passages
            in Mr. <hi>Sandersons</hi> History of the Life and Reign of
            King <hi>Charles,</hi> in which he
            layeth
            a scandal upon the Doctor that he
            was
            an
            Agent for the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Doctor indeed in all
            his Writings,
            did
            ever assert the Kings
            Prerogative,
            and the Churches
            Rights,
            for which he incurr'd the Odium of the opposire Party, with
            whom
            'tis ordinary to brand such persons
            with the ignominious name of <hi>Papists,</hi>
            or being
            Popishly
            affected,
            as abhor the other extreme of Puritanism, in which kind of
            Calumnies
            the Doctor hath
            sufficiently
            had
            his share, though no man hath
            written
            more sharply
            against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
            appears
            from most of his Books,
            and particularly
            in his <hi>Theologia Veterum,</hi> and his
            Sermons
            upon the <hi>Tares:</hi>
            but though these have not been
            able to secure him
            from the malicious Tongues
            and Pens
            of ill men,
            yet his innocence hath
            found very worthy Advocates.
            Among whom
            I thank particularly
            the Reverend and Learned
            Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Answer to <hi>T.G.</hi> who
            would have made
            use of the Puritans
            accusation for the Papists
            purpose, but the worthy Doctor quickly
            refuted
            him
            out of the fourth Sermon of Doctor
            <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            upon the <hi>Tares,</hi>
            where he lays
            at the door of the Papists
            the most gross Idolatry,
            greater
            than which was
            never known
            among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi></p>
          <p>
            But against these things
              'tis commonly
              said,
              and as commonly
              believed;
              that some persons,
              and those of most illustrious quality, have
              been
              perverted
              from the Protestant Faith to Popery, by
              reading
              some of the Doctors
              Books,
              and particularly
              that which he writ about the History
              of the Reformation, called
              <hi>Ecclesia Restaurata.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in
            
            
            his late History upon the same subject,
              has
              done
              all he can to confirm the world in that belief. For after a
              short commendation of Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> style and method
              (it being
              usual with some men
              slightly
              to praise those at first, whom
              they design to sting and lash afterward) he
              presumes
              to tell his Reader, that <hi>either the Doctor
              was
              ill inform'd, or very much led
              by his passions,
              and he being
              wrought
              on by most violent prejudices
              against some that were
              concerned
              in that time, delivers
              many things
              in such a manner,
              and so strangely,
              that one would think that he had
              been
              secretly
              set on to it, by those of the Church of Rome, though I
              donbt
              not but he was
              a sincere Protestant, but violently
              carried
              away by some particular conceits.
              In one thing he is
              not to be excused,
              that he never vouched
              any Authority for what he writ; which
              is
              not to be forgiven
              any who write of Transactions
              beyond their own time, and deliver us
              things
              not known
              before.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Objection having
              many particular Charges
              contained
              in it, will require as many distinct
              Answers,
              which I shall give in short. And first, if it be true that
              any have embraced
              the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, by means
              of that Book, he may enclude them
              to be very incompetent Judges
              in the matters
              of Religion, that will be prevailed
              upon to change it upon the perusal of one single History;
              and especially
              in the Controversies
              between us and the <hi>Papists,</hi>
              which do not depend upon matter of fact, or
              an
              Historical Narration of what Occurrences
              happened
              in this Kingdom, but upon doctrine of Faith, what we are to
              believe and disbelieve, in order to our
              serving
              God in this life, and being
              Eternally
              blessed
              with him
              in the next. Secondly,
              As for his vouching
              no Authority for what he writ, which
              is
              not to be forgiven
              him,
              I hope the Doctor has
              met
              with a more merciful Judge in another World, than Mr.
              <hi>Burnet</hi> is
              in this. If he had
              been
              a Factor for <hi>Papists,</hi>
              Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> should have
              presented
              one particular instance, which he cannot do. As we have
              said
              before in his Life, he communicated
              that design of his <hi>History of Reformation</hi> to
              Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> from
              whom
              he received
              all imaginable encouragement, by ancient
              Records
              that he perused.
              And what benefit could any Reader receive, to have
              quoted
              to him
              the pages
              of Manuscripts,
              Acts
              of Parliament,
              Records
              of old Charters,
              Registers
              of Convocation, Orders
              of the Council-Table, or any of those out of the
              <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, which the Doctor
              made
              use of. The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> writ of
              Transactions
              beyond his own time, living
              as far distant from the Reign of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. as
              Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              did
              from K. <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. who
              laid
              the first foundation of the Reformation, yet I cannot find
              there more quotations
              of Authors
              than in Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> History; yet I suppose Mr.
              <hi>Burnet</hi> will look upon the Lord <hi>Bacons</hi>
              History as compleat.
              And if all this were
              made
              out, 'tis no more than what may be
              laid
              at the door of the Author, who lately
              writ the History of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
            
            where are reported
              the most abominable Scandals
              that were
              broach'd by the malicious Covenanters
              against the <hi>Scottish</hi> Hierarchy, and they are
              permitted
              without the least contradiction
              or confutation to pass as infallible
              Truths,
              that so Posterity, as well as the present
              prejudiced
              Age might be levened
              with an
              implacable enmity and hatred against the whole Order of
              Episcopacy. Although the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>
              were
              the old inveterate Enemies
              of the <hi>Stuarts;</hi>
              and the Duke of whom
              the History is
              compiled,
              was
              an
              Enemy as treacherous to K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. as any that
              ever appeared
              against him
              in open Arms.
              He was
              the cause of the first Tumult raised
              in <hi>Edenburgh:</hi>
              He Authorised
              the Covenant with some few alterations
              in it, and generally
              imposed
              it on that Kingdom. He was
              the chief Person that prevailed
              with the King
            
            
            
            to continue the Parliament during the pleasure of the two
              Houses,
              and boasted
              how he had
              got
              a perpetual Parliament for the <hi>English,</hi> and would
              do the like for the <hi>Scots.</hi>
              He aimed
              at nothing less than the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
              had
              so courted
              the common Soldiers,
              that <hi>David Ramsey</hi> openly
              began
              a health to K. <hi>James</hi> VII. yet all these
              things,
              with many others are either quite
              smothered,
              or so painted
              over by Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that the Volume he
              has
              writ may be called
              an
              Apology or a Panegyrick,
              rather than a History. Of all these
              matters
              the Doctor hath
              acquainted
              the world before in the Life of Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi>
              and the Observations
              that he wrote
              upon Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s History of King
              <hi>Charles</hi> I. I will be bold to aver, if the Doctor
              had
              employed
              his great Learning
              and Abilities
              to have written
              but one half of those things
              against the King and Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he
              wrote
              for them,
              he would have been
              accounted
              by very many persons
              (I will not say by Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>) the
              truest
              Protestant, the most faithful Historian, the
              greatest
              Scholar, and in their own phrase <hi>the most
              pretious
              man,</hi> that ever yet breathed
              in the Nation. But he had
              the good luck to be a Scholar, and better luck to employ his
              Learning
              like an
              honest man and a good Christian, in the defence of a
              righteous and pious King, of an
              Apostolical and true Church, of a venerable and
              learned
              Clergy, and that drew
              upon him
              all the odium and malice, that two opposite
              Parties,
              Papist and Sectary, could heap upon
              him.

          <p>
            After the happy Restauration of the King, it
              was
              high time for the good Doctor to rest a while from his
              Labours,
              and bless himself with joy for the
              coming
              in of his Sovereign: for now the Sun
              shone
              more gloriously
              in our Hemisphere than ever, the Tyrannical
              powers
              being
              dissolved,
              the King brought
              home to his people, the Kingdom
              setled
              in peace, the Church restored
              to its
              rights,
              and the true Religion established,
              every man returned
              to his own vine with joy, who had
              been
              a good Subject and a sufferer, and the Doctor
              came
              to his old habitation in <hi>Westminster,</hi> of which and
              of his other Preferments
              he had
              been
              dispossest
              for the space of seventeen years,
              and he no sooner
              got
              thither, but according
              to his wonted
              custom, he sets
              upon building, and erected
              a new Room in his Prebends
              house to entertain his Friends
              in. And seldom was
              he without Visitors,
              especially
              the Clergy of the Convocation, who
              constantly
              came
              to him
              for his Advice and Direction in
              matters
              relating
              to the Church, because he had
              been
              himself an
              ancient Clerk in the old Convocations.
              Many Persons
              of Quality, besides
              the Clergy, for the Reverence they
              had
              to his Learning,
              and the delight they took
              in his company, payed
              him
              several visits,
              which he never repayed,
              being
              still so devoted
              to his Studies,
              that except going
              to Church, it was
              a rare thing to find him
              from home. I happen'd to be there, when the good Bishop of
              <hi>Durham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cousins,</hi>
              came
              to see him;
              who after a great deal of familiar discourse between
              them;
              said,
              I wonder Brother <hi>Heylyn</hi>
              thou art not a Bishop, but we all know thou
              hast
              deserved
              it. To which he answered,
              <hi>Much good may it do the new
              Bishops,
              I do not envy them,
              but wish they may do more than I have
              done.</hi>
              Now what that great Man did
              so readily
              acknowledge
              to be the Doctors
              due, was
              no more than what his true worth might
              justly
              challenge from all that were
              Friends
              to Learning
              and Virtue. For his knowledge was
              extensive as the Earth, and in his little world, the great
              one was
              so fully
              comprehended,
              that not an
              Island or Province, nay scarce a Rock or Shelf could escape
              his strict survey and exact description.
              Nor was
              he content with that degree of knowledge which
              did
              far exceed what any other durst
              hope, or even wish for, <hi>viz.</hi> A perfect
              familiarity
            
            
            with the present State of all the
              Countreys
              in the World, but he was
              resolved
              to understand as well what they
              had
              always
              been,
              as what they then were;
              to be as throughly
              acquainted
              with their History, as he was
              with their Situation, and to leave nothing worth the
              knowing,
              undiscovered. So that what he has
              done
              in that kind, looks
              liker
              the product of the most Learned
              and Antient
              Inhabitans of their respective Countreys,
              than the issue of the industry of a Single Person. Yet for
              all this, his head was
              not so filled
              with the contemplations
              of this World, as to leave no room for the great
              concerns
              of the other. But on the contrary, the main of his Study
              was
              Divinity, the rest were
              but by the by, and subservient to that. For he
              having
              strictly
              viewed
              and examined
              all the various Religions
              and Governments
              upon Earth, and coming
              to compare them
              with those under which himself lived,
              did
              find the advantage
              both in respect of this life and another to lie so much on
              the side of these, as made
              him
              a most resolute Champion for them,
              and was
              the reason that he was
              often heated
              with great Indignation against those that
              were
              so blind or obstinate, to endeavour the interruption of such
              transcendent blessings:
              And though some have thought his zeal too ardent, yet they
              might consider, that it was
              his fortune to live in such times
              as made
              the highest
              expressions
              of it not only just but necessary: Of which he
              was
              so sensible, that forgetting
              all his other diverting
              Studies,
              he wholly
              set himself to endeavour
              the defence and support of a tottering
              Church and Grown,
              which he laboured
              to that degree, that his body (though
              naturally
              a very strong one) not being
              able to keep pace with his mind,
              was
              often hurried
              into violent Fevers.
              And at last his eyes
              (of themselves brisk and sparkling)
              through continual watchings
              and intensness,
              lost
              their function, and refused
              any longer
              to assist his Studies.
              Yet could not all this abate the vigour of his mind, which
              as tho it had
              lost
              no outward assistance, or that it
              stood
              in need of none, still continued
              its
              action, and produced
              several excellent Books
              after their Author was
              neither capable of writing
              nor reading
              them.
              Nor was
              any thing but death able so much as to slacken his industry:
              for besides
              the discouragements
              I have named,
              he had
              all those which an
              Usurped
              Authority, (under which he was
              forced
              to live, and against which he could not forbear both to
              speak and write) could threaten
              him
              with; for he was
              thereby not only deprived
              of his Preferments,
              but often put in hazard of his life: But that merciful God,
              who never faileth
              those that trust in him,
              did
              preserve him,
              that he might enjoy the fruits
              of his pains
              and prayers
              in the Restauration
              of that Religion and Government which he so
              truly
              loved,
              and had
              so earnestly
              endeavoured;
              in the publick
              enjoyment of which he lived
              three years.
              And then having
              compleated
              the utmost of his wishes
              in the world, God was
              pleased
              to call him
              to the eternal Reward of another; and in so favourable a way
              as he might well look upon as a remarkable instance of the
              divine Goodness towards
              him.
              For as we read in the Scriptures
              that God did
              frequently
              warn his Servants
              of their approaching
              deaths,
              so he dealt
              with this good man. For on the <hi>Saturday</hi> night
              before he fell sick, he dreamed,
              That he was
              in an
              extraordinary pleasant and delightful place, where
              standing
              and admiring
              the Beauty and Glory of it, he saw
              the late King his Master, who said
              to him,
              <hi>Peter, I will have you buried
              under your Seat at Church, for you are
              rarely
              seen
              but there, or at your Study.</hi> This Dream he
              related
              to his Wife next morning, told
              her it was
              a significant one, and charged
              her to let him
              be buried
              according
              to it. On the <hi>Monday</hi> he
              bought
              an
              House in the <hi>Almonry,</hi> Sealed
              the Writings
              and paid
              the Money the
              same day; and at night told
              his Wife, he had
              bought
              her an
              House to live in near the <hi>Abby,</hi>
              that she might serve God in that Church as he
              had
              done:
              And then renewing
              his Charge of burying
              him
              according
              to his dream, went
              to bed very well, but after his first sleep,
              was
              taken
              with a violent Fever, which deprived
              him
              of his understanding,
              till a few hours
              before his death; when seeing
              one of the Vergers
              of the Church in his Chamber, he
              called
              him,
              and said,
              <hi>I know it is
              Church time with you, and this is</hi>
              Ascension <hi>day, I am
              ascending
              to the Church triumphant, I go to my God and Saviour, into
              joys
              Celestial, and to Hallelujahs
              eternal.</hi> After which and other like
              expressions
              he died
              the same day, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1663. in the 63 year of his
              Age. He had
              eleven Children,
              four of which are still living.
              He was
              buried
              under the Sub-Dean's Seat, according
              to his dream and desire, over against which, on the
              North-side of the <hi>Abby,</hi>
              stands
              his Monument
              with this Inscription, composed
              by Dr. <hi>Earl,</hi> then Dean of that Church.

          <p>WHen the
            disputes
            were
            first raised
            by those of the <hi>Genevian</hi> faction, against the
            <hi>Divine Service</hi> of this Church, it
            was
            pretended
            that they were
            well enough content to admit a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> so it
            were
            such an
            one, as tended
            more to edification
            and increase of Piety, than that which
            was
            imposed
            and established
            by the Laws
            of this Land, was
            given
            out to do. That which most seemed
            to trouble them,
            as they gave
            it out, was,
            that it had
            too much in it of the <hi>Roman
            Rituals;</hi>
            that it was
            cloyed
            with many superstitious and offensive
            Ceremonies,
            the frequent and
            unnecessary repetition of the Lords
            Prayer, the ill translation of the
            Psalms
            and other Scriptures,
            the intermixture of impertinent
            Responsories,
            whereby the course of the Prayers
            was
            interrupted;
            and finally,
            the diffeence betwixt that Liturgie,
            and those of other reformed
            Churches,
            with which they did
            desire to hold a more strict Communion. But
            being
            beaten
            from these holds,
            as by many others, so more chiefly
            by judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> and never
            daring
            to adventure
            any more in pursuit of that quarrel, the <hi>Smectymnians</hi>
            in our times
            resolved
            upon a nearer
            course to effect their purposes,
            than the <hi>Martinists</hi>
            had
            done
            before them;
            and rather chose
            to fell down Liturgie
            it self as having
            no authority from the Word of God, nor from the practice of
            Gods
            people, than waste their time in
            lopping
            off the branches
            and excrescencies
            of it. Accordingly
            they reduced
            the whole state of the Controversie
            to these two Positions.</p>
          <p n="1"><hi>1.</hi> That if by <hi>Liturgy we understand
            an
            order observed
            in Church Assemblies,
            of Praying,
            Reading,
            and Expounding
            the Scriptures,
            Administring
            Sacraments,</hi>
            c. <hi>Such a Liturgy they know, and do acknowledge
            both</hi> Jews
            <hi>and</hi> Christians
            <hi>to have used:
            But if by Liturgy we undersTand
            prescribed
            and stinted
            forms
            of Administration composed
            by some particular men
            in the Church,</hi> and imposed
            upon all the rest, then they are sure (for <hi>so they must be
            understood,
            if they say any thing</hi>) that no such
            Liturgie
            hath
            been
            used
            ancient by the <hi>Jews</hi>
            or <hi>Christians.</hi></p>
          <p n="2"><hi>2.</hi> That the <hi>first
            Reformers
            of Religion did
            never intend the use of a Liturgy
            surther, than to
            be an
            help in the want, or to the weakness of a Minister;</hi> and
            thereupon it is
            inferred
            with contempt enough, that if any Minister appear insufficient
            to discharge the duty of conceived
            Prayer, it may be imposed
            on him
            as a punishment to use set forms
            and no other.</p>
          <p>If these two Propositions
            did
            proceed from the same one spirit, as no doubt they
            did,
            the extream
            falshood
            of the last doth prove sufficiently,
            that neither of them
            did
            proceed from the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi> King <hi>Edward
            VI.</hi> the Lord Protector then
            being,
            and the learned
            Prelates
            of that time, were
            our first Reformers;
            the two first approving
            and confirming,
            the last labouring
            and acting
            in that weighty business, but all
            contributing
            to the passing
            of an
            Act of Parliament, <hi>for uniformity of Service, and
            Administration of the Sacraments,
            2</hi> and <hi>3.</hi> Ed. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi> and in
            that Act it is
            said
            expresly,
            <hi>That all Ministers
            in any Cathedral or Parish Church, or other place within this
            Realm of</hi> England, Wales,
            <hi>and other the Kings
            Dominions,
            shall from and after the Feast of</hi> Pentecost <hi>next
            coming,
            be bounden
            to say and use all Mattens, Evensong, Celebration of the
            Lords
            Supper, commonly
            called
            the Mass, and Administration of each of the
            Sacraments,
            and their common and open Prayer, in such order and form as
            is
            mentioned
            in the same Book, and none other or otherwise.</hi> Which
            clause continued
            still in being
            (notwithstanding the alteration of the
            Liturgie)
            till K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s death, and
            was
            revived
            again in the Act of Parliament, <hi>1 Eliz. cap. 2.</hi> By
            which the second Liturgie
            was
            confirmed
            and ratified.
            Assuredly,
            they that are bound
            to officiate by a <hi>Form</hi>
            prescribed,
            to use <hi>no other Form</hi> but that; and to use that
            <hi>Form no otherwise</hi> than the Law
            requireth,
            and requireth
            under several penalties
            contained
            in it; cannot be said
            to be at liberty to use or not to use it as they list
            themselves; nor can pretend in any reason, nor with common
            sense, <hi>That the first Reformers
            of Religion, did
            never intend the use of a Liturgy
            further, than to be an
            help in the want, or to the weakness of a Minister.</hi> What
            the Reformers
            did
            in other Countreys,
            was
            no Rule to ours,
            who in the modelling
            of that great work, had
            not only an
            eye and respect (as the forementioned
            Statute telleth
            us) to the most sincere
            and pure Christian Religion taught
            by the Scripture, as probably
            the others had,
            but also to the usages
            in the Primitive Church, which certainly
            the others had
            not. So that the second Position, which the proud Inference
            thence deducted,
            being
            blown
            aside, the whole weight of the cause must
            wholly
            rest upon the first, which whether it be of strength enough to
            support the same, is
            the main disquisition and enquiry which we have in hand.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>For when this Proposition was
            first vented,
            and the point had
            been
            somewhat ventilated
            betwixt the
            humble Remonstrant on the one part, and the Smectymnians on
            the other, I was
            required
            by those who had
            Authority to command me, to try what I could do in
            drawing
            down the Pedegree
            and the descent of Liturgies
            from the first use and institution of
            them
            amongst the Jews,
            till they were
            setled
            and established
            also amongst the Christians.
            For since the Smectymnians
            had
            appealed
            to the ancient practice of the Jews
            and Christians,
            affirming
            positively
            that no such Liturgies
            (that is
            to say, no stinted
            and prescribed
            Forms
            of Administration) were
            anciently
            used
            by either of them;
            it is
            most fit and just they should be
            tryed
            by the Records
            and practice of those elder times
            to which they have Appealed
            for their justification. So that the point between us
            being
            matter of Fact, I shall pursue it in the way of
            an
            Historical Narration; in which the Affirmative
            being
            made
            good by sufficient evidence, it will be very difficult, if not
            impossible, to prove the Negative. And for the better
            making
            good of the Affirmative; I have
            taken
            in the Jewish Rabbins,
            and other Antiquaries
            of that people, of most faith and credit, the holy
            Fathers,
            and other Ecclesiastical Authors
            since the times
            of Christ, to testifie
            unto the truth of what here is
            said;
            either by way of explication of such
            Texts
            of Scripture which do relate unto this cause, or in the way of
            declaration, as laying
            down the practice of the Jews
            or Christians
            in their several times.
            And that it may be seen
            that Liturgies
            or Set Forms
            of worship were
            of general usage, I have made
            diligent search into the best and most unquestioned
            monuments
            of the ancient Gentiles,
            and traced
            out many of their Forms
            of prayer and sacrifice, used
            by them
            in the most religious acts
            of those performances,
            and placed
            that search betwixt the practice of the
            Jews
            and that of the Christians.
            And I have placed
            it in that order, to the end that it may appear that the
            Christians
            had
            not only some ground of Scripture, Tradition
            Apostolical,
            and the best judgments
            of their own times
            to direct this business; but that they
            were
            also guided
            in it by the light of Nature, the Word of God amongst the
            Jews,
            and the constant practice of that people in the
            times
            precedent.</p>
          <p>Nor have I only took
            this pains
            in tracing
            out the constant practice of all people in respect of
            Liturgies,
            but also with relation unto the necessary
            adjuncts
            and concomitants
            of them.
            <hi>Set Forms
            of Worship</hi> require <hi>set
            times
            and places</hi>
            to perform them
            in; which gives
            occasion to insert some notes
            or observations
            touching
            the Festivals,
            or days
            of Religious offices,
            taken
            up by the Authority of the Church in several
            Ages,
            according
            as the commemoration of some signal
            benefits,
            or Gods
            special mercies
            toward them
            might invite them
            to it. The like I have done
            also in the erecting
            and dedicating
            of those sacred places
            which have been
            destinated
            in all times
            to Religious offices,
            from the first Consecrating
            of the Tabernacle by Gods
            own appointment, till the last dedication of the Temple in the
            time of <hi>Herod,</hi> and from the first
            deputing
            of some places
            by the Lords
            Apostles,
            for the divine performances
            and administrations
            of the Christian Faith, till calmer
            times
            permitted
            the erecting
            of those stately Fabricks
            which the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
            looked
            upon with envy and admiration. Some other
            things
            are intermingled
            touching
            the Habit of the Priests
            or Ministers
            under either Testament in the time or act of their
            officiating;
            as also of the Gestures
            used
            both by Priests
            and People, according
            to the several offices
            and acts
            of worship. And
            this I have drawn
            down unto the time of S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s death, when neither
            Superstition
            in point of worship, nor Heterodoxie
            in point of Doctrine, had
            gotten
            any predominancy in the Church of Christ, which
            was
            then come unto her height both for peace and purity. By which
            the Reader may perceive how warrantably
            this Church proceeded
            in her <hi>Reformation,</hi> as to this particular, how
            <hi>strict an
            eye</hi> was
            had
            therein, <hi>as well to the most sincere and pure Christian
            Religion taught
            by the Scripture, as to the usages
            in the Primitive Church,</hi> how justifiable in the whole
            course and order of her publick
            Liturgie,
            with all the Rubricks
            and observances
            therein contained.
            In which, if any thing be done
            conducible unto Gods
            glory and the Churches
            peace, the information of the Reader, or the
            convincing
            of such men
            who are otherwise minded,
            I shall think my labour well bestowed,
            and my pains
            well recompensed.
            Howsoever it will be some matter of contentment to me that I
            have done
            my duty in it, according
            unto that poor measure
            of abilities
            which the Lord hath
            given
            me; commending
            both the cause and these weak indevours
            to his Heavenly blessings,

              IT
                is
                exceeding
                well observed
                by our incomparable <hi>Hooker,</hi>
              
              as some truly

              <hi>That if the Angels
                have a continual intercourse
                betwixt the Throne of God in Heaven, and his Church here
                militant upon the Earth, the same
                is
                no where better verified
                than in those two godly exercises
                of Doctrine and Prayer. For what,</hi>
                saith
                he, <hi>is
                the assembling
                of the Church to learn, but the
                receiving
                of Angels
                descended
                from above? What to pray, but the
                ascending
                of Angels
                upwards?
                His Heavenly inspirations,
                and our holy desires
                being
                as so many Angels
                of commerce and intercourse between God and us.</hi> And
                although these two godly and religious
                exercises
                seem to walk hand in hand together; the
                Prayers
                made
                in and by the Church, having
                for many Ages
                past, even long before the birth of Christianity,
                been
                intermingled
                with the reading
                of the Law and Prophets;
                yet find we that of Prayer so acceptable in the sight of
                God, so highly
                valued
                by the Lord, above all other parts
                of his publick
                Service, that he vouchsafed
                from hence to give a name to his holy Temple, and to
                entitle it,
              
              <hi>The House of Prayer.</hi> Which holy and religious
                duty, as it concerneth
                us two ways,
                one way in that we are men,
                and another way as parts
                and members
                of the Church, the mystical Body of our Lord and Saviour;
                so it admits
                of several considerations
                both for the matter
                of the same, and the manner of it. As
                men
                we are at our own choice for time, place, and form,
                according
                to the exigences
                of our own occasions.
                The Church requires
                not any thing in the performance of this pious office,
                either as private or domestical; but that we pray with
                understanding;
                that we consider with our selves
                what it is
                we ask,
              
              and of whom
                we ask it. <hi>Ye ask and receive not</hi>
                (saith
                S. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>because ye ask amiss, that ye may
                consume it upon your lusts.</hi>
                But for the Service which we do as a
                publick
                body, that being
                publick,
                is
                for that cause to be accompted
                so much the worthier
                than the other, as a whole society of such condition
                exceedeth
                the worth of any one particular person; and for that cause
                hath
                been
                more strictly
                tied
                in all former Ages,
                as to prescribed
                times
                and places,
                so to set Forms
                also. For were
                there not some time prescribed
                (in the great growth and spreading
                of the Church of God) for the convening
                of the Congregation, some place
                assigned
                in which to meet together at the
                times
                appointed;
                the prayers
                and devotions
                of Gods
                people might and would happen oftentimes
                to be either at the same time in several
                places,
                or in the same place at several
                times;
                and so be nothing less than the common
                prayers,
                the joynt
                devotions
                of Gods
                Servants.
                Of all the circumstances
                which attend Gods
                publick
                Service, those two, of time and place, come most near the
                substance; and are <hi>de bene esse</hi> at the least, of
                that weighty duty.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if appointed
                times
                and places,
                being
                meerly
                circumstances,
              
              be of so great a consequence in
                Gods
                publick
                Service, that without them
                it cannot be discharged
                with
              
              
              
              effect and comfort; assuredly
                the form thereof, containing
                the whole substance; the main body of it
                hath
                much more need to be prescribed.
                For what saith
                the Apostle in this case, or one very near it, <hi>If the
                whole Church should come together in some place, and all
                speak with tongues,</hi>
              
              <hi>and there come in those which are
                Unbelievers,
                would they not say that ye are mad?</hi>
              
              Or what a tumult would it be, if when you come together,
                <hi>every one of you hath
                a Psalm, hath
                a Tongue, hath
                a Doctrine, hath
                a Revelation;</hi> would it not be a strange
                medly?
              
              <hi>God,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                hath
                told
                us, is
                <hi>the God of order, not of confusion in the
                Churches.</hi>
                And therefore hath
                given
                power unto his Church, that all
                things
                in it, for the manner,
              
              be done
                 decently,
                in a stablished
                order, and for the end thereof,
              
              to edifying.
                A thing which could not be in possibility,
                had
                every man the liberty to use his own tongue in the
                Congregation, or to conceive and utter his own
                prayers,
                or frame unto himself his own devotions;
                which is
                the ground of all those several
                Liturgies
                and set Forms
                of Prayer, which have from the Apostles
                times
                been
                used
                in the House of God, and never quarrelled
                till of late. Nor can it be ascribed,
                as I conceive, to any lower power than the Wisdom of God,
                guiding
                the Counsels
                of his Church, and therefore to be
                reckoned
                as a work of his singular Providence, that the Church
                hath
                evermore observed
                a prescript form of Common-Prayer, although not in all
                things
                every where the same, yet for the most part
                retaining
                still the same Analogy.
              
              So that (as <hi>Hooker</hi> well
                observeth)
                if the Liturgies
                of all ancient Churches
                throughout the world be compared
                amongst themselves, it may be easily
                perceived
                that they had
                all one original mould; and that the
                publick
                prayers
                of the People of God in Churches
                throughly
                setled
                and established,
                did
                never use to be voluntary dictates,
                proceeding
                from any mans
                extemporal wit. And certainly
                to drive this point unto an
                end, (with some small alteration of my
                Authors
                words)
                <hi>To him
                who doth consider the grievous and scandalous
                inconveniencies
                whereunto they make themselves daily subject, when any
                blind and secret corner is
                made
                a fit place for Common-Prayer; the manifold
                Confusions
                which they fall into, which cry down all the difference of
                days
                and times;
                the irksome Deformities,
                whereby through endless and senseless
                Effusions
                of indigested
                Prayers
                they oftentimes
                disgrace in most unsufferable manner, the
                worthiest
                part of Christian duty towards
                God, who being
                subject herein to no certain order, do pray both what they
                list, and how they list; to him
                I say, which duly
                weigheth
                all these things,
                the reason cannot be obscure, why God so much
                respects
                in publick
                Prayer, not only the solemnity of
                places
                where, and the conveniency of the
                times
                when; but also the precise appointment, even with what
                words
                or sentences
                his Name should be called
                on amongst his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have said
                little all this while of the Priest or Minister,
              
              with whom
                Gods
                people are to joyn
                themselves in this publick
                action, as with him
                that standeth and speaketh
                for them
                in the presence of God; because I could not tell what
                place or Ministry to assign him
                in the discharge of this imployment,
                unless we first premise a set form of Prayer, as a point
                necessary to be granted.
                For in effusion of extemporal Prayers,
                I cannot see what greater
                priviledge
                belongs
                to him,
                than any other of the People; or why each member of the
                Congregation may not as well express his own
                conceptions
                in the House of God, as he who calls
                himself the Minister. For being
                that the ability (if I may so call it) of
                pouring
                out extemporary prayers,
                doth come by gifts,
                and not by study; in which regard themselves entitle it
                most commonly
                <hi>the gift of Prayer:</hi> Why may not other
                men
                pretend unto that gift, as much as he; or on opinion that
                they have it, may not make use thereof in the
                Congregation? Why may not any one so
                gifted,
                or so opinionated
                of his gift, say unto his Minister as <hi>Zedekiah</hi>
                did
                unto <hi>Micaiah</hi> (in case he do not also strike
                him
                <hi>upon the cheek</hi>) <hi>Mene
                ergo dimisit Spiritus Domini,  locutus est tibi?</hi>
              
              Which way went
                the Spirit of the Lord from me, to speak unto
                thee?
                Assuredly
                the gift of prayer is
                as much restrained
                in the People, by hearkening
                only to those expressions
                which are delivered
                by their Minister, as that of the Minister can be, (be he
                who he will) by tying
                up his spirit to those forms
                which are prescribed
                by the Church. This, if it be a
                <hi>quenching
                of the Spirit,</hi> as some please to make it,
                is
                such a <hi>quenching
                of the Spirit</hi> as hath
                good ground from God himself, who
                did
                not only prescribe
                unto his Priests
                those very words,
              
              wherewith they were
                to bless the People, as we shall see hereafter in due
                place and time;
              
              but did
                instruct both Priests
                and People, both the Apostles
                and Disciples
                how they were
                to pray, in what set form they might present their
                souls
                and desires
                unto him.
                So little priviledge
                hath
                the Priest or Minister more than other People, to speak
                his own thoughts
                in the Congregation by way of voluntary
                and extemporal prayers,
                on the grounds
                they go on; that on the same, the
                meanest
                of the multitude may pretend the like, and that as well in
                other parts
                of publick
              
              
              worship as in that of prayer; which what a Chaos of
                devotion it would introduce, I leave to every sober
                minded
                man to judge by that which followeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              For if we look into the publick
                Service of Almighty God,
              
              according
                as it standeth in all well-regulated
                Churches;
                it doth consist of these three parts,
                Prayer, Praise, and Preaching:
                Taking
                the word Preaching
                here in the largest
                sense, for publishing
                or making
                known
                the will of God, by whatsoever means
                it be, touching
                mans
                salvation. The Church of <hi>England</hi> so
                conceives
                it, when in the general Invitation she
                informs
                her Children
                that the chief reasons
                why they do assemble and meet together,
              
              are <hi>to set forth Gods
                most holy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask
                those things
                which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as
                the soul.</hi> The Brethren of the Separation (as they
                call themselves) do conceive so too, though with some
                variation of the terms,
                saying
                there be three kinds
                of spiritual worship, <hi>Praying,
                Prophesying,</hi>
                and <hi>Singing
                of Psalms.</hi>
              
              They add, with truth enough in the affirmation,
                were
                there but any sense in the application,
                that <hi>there is
                the same reason of helps
                in all the parts
                of spiritual worship</hi> (as is
                to be admitted
                in any one) <hi>during the time of
                performing
                the worship.</hi> What then? Observe
                I pray you the illation and the necessity thereof on the
                former grounds.
                <hi>Therefore</hi> (for so they do infer) <hi>as in Prayer
                the Book is
                laid
                aside, and that by the confession of the ancient Brethren
                of the separation; so must it also be in
                Prophesying,
                and in Singing
                of Psalms,
                as we are perswaded.</hi>
                What, are they but perswaded
                of it, and no more than so? Yes sure, they are more
                positive and affirm for certain,
              
              <hi>that as in Prayer the Spirit only
                is
                our help, and there is
                no outward help given
                of God for that kind of worship; so also in
                Prophesying
                and Singing.</hi>
                And in another place more plainly,
                <hi>therefore whether we Pray, Prophesie,
                or Sing, it must be the Word or Scripture, not out of the
                book, but out of the heart.</hi>
              
              Add here these <hi>Quaeres</hi>
                raised
                on the former <hi>Thesis.</hi>
              
              1. <hi>Whether in a</hi> Psalm <hi>a man must be
                tyed
                to</hi> Metre, Rhythm, <hi>and</hi> Tune; <hi>and whether
                voluntary be not as necessary in tune and
                words
                as in matter.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether</hi> Metre, Rhythm,
                <hi>and</hi> Tune, <hi>be not quenching
                the spirit.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether a</hi> Psalm <hi>be only
                thanksgiving without</hi> Metre, Rhythm, <hi>and</hi>
                Tune, <hi>yea or no.</hi> Put this together, and then tell
                me truly
                whosoever thou art, if when a great and populous
                Congregation should be met
                together, every one of them
                in that part of worship which consists
                in Singing,
                should first conceive his own matter, deliver it in Prose
                or Metre as he list himself, and in the same instant chant
                it out in what Tune soever, that which
                comes
                first into his head: Tell me I say, if ever there
                were
                heard
                so black a <hi>Sanctus,</hi> such a
                confused
                and horrid noise of tongues
                and voices;
                if any howling
                or gnashing
                of the teeth
                whatever, can be like unto it. And yet it
                follows
                so directly
                on the former Principles,
                that if we banish all set forms
                of Common-prayer, which is
                but one part only of Gods
                publick
                worship; we cannot but in justice and in reason both,
                banish all studied
                and premeditated
                Sermons
                from the House of God; and utterly
                cast out all King <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms
                (whether in Prose or Metre, that
                comes
                all to one) and all divine Hymns
                also into the bargain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This,
              
              though it be sufficient to discover the great and
                scandalous inconveniencies
                that necessarily
                would follow in Gods
                publick
                Service, if once the solemn and set
                forms
                thereof were
                quite laid
                aside; or any ground of hope given
                unto that confusion, which some have
                pleased
                to call the <hi>liberty of the Spirit of God;</hi> so may
                there somewhat else be added
                to set forth the necessity of those
                publick
                forms
                which they so labour to put down. For if we cast a careful
                eye upon the business, we may perceive without much
                difficulty, that as a prescript form of Common-prayer, as
                well amongst the Jews
                as Christians,
                proceeded
                either from the Example of God, who in some
                cases
                so prescribed
                it; or from the Wisdom of God guiding
                the counsels
                of his Church, as before was
                noted:
                So by the Law and light of Nature, which
                was
                the way whereby he pleased
                to manifest himself, and make known
                his will unto the Gentiles,
                they also were
                directed
                to set forms
                of Worship, though otherwise mistaken
                utterly
                in the object of it: For being
                taught
                by Nature that there was
                a God, one universal supream
                Power that disposed
                of all things;
                and that that God was
                to be served
                and worshipped
                by them,
                even with the best of their devotions:
                It was
                not long before they had
                agreed
                on set times
                and places
                for the performance of that Worship; as also of some
                special Minister by whom
                to tender some solemn forms
                of words
                in which to represent their said
                devotions.
                The ignorance and blindness of their
                hearts
                occasioned
                them
                to set up Idols
                in the place of God; and to serve many
                Gods
                instead of one. But in the service of those
                gods,
                in the adoring
                of those Idols,
                they thought it did
                concern them
                in an
                high degree, to do it with the most solemnity, with the
                greatest
                majesty that wisest
                of them
                could devise; prescribing
                as it were
                by common counsel and advice, whatever
              
              
              
              they intended
                to have done
                therein both for form and matter. So that it will appear
                on a diligent search, that in all
                publick
                Congregations
                of men
                met
                together for the performance of Religious
                Offices,
                whether they did
                adhere to false gods,
                or adore the true; there was
                not any thing almost left arbitrary: nothing almost which
                was
                not limited
                and prescribed
                by Rules
                or Rubricks;
                no kind of service to be done
                for which there was
                not some set form prescribed
                in their established
                and received
                Liturgies.
                The following
                of which search is
                the intent and Argument of this present work. In which I
                doubt not but to make it plain and evident by the
                continual and constant practice of the former
                times,
                that in all publick
                Congregations,
                whether of the Jews
                under the Law, or of the Gentiles
                without the Law, or of the Christians
                being
                a body of men
                made
                up both of Jews
                and Gentiles;
                both Priests
                and People have been
                tied
                to set forms
                of worship: And therefore that the use of a
                publick
                Liturgy is
                no such new matter in the world, as some
                men
                have made
                it, who will needs
                have it a device either of a lazy zeal, or Popish
                ignorance.
            </p>
            <p>
              But first before we do proceed in this search of
                Liturgies,
              
              we must take notice of the word, and explain the same,
                lest being
                mistaken
                in the ground, the building prove
                unsure and
                faulty. And here for the <hi>quid nominis, Suidas</hi>
                derives
                the word , from ,
              
              which signifieth
                <hi>publick,</hi>
                and , any work or <hi>office.</hi>
                 (saith
                that old <hi>Grammarian</hi>) . Which
                doubtless is
                the true and proper <hi>Etymologie,</hi>
                the old word being
                 as we find in <hi>Stephanus;</hi>
              
               <hi>q. d. opus publicum faciens,</hi>
                and  <hi>opus aliquod publicum
                facio;</hi> and shortly
                after,  <hi>pro</hi>
                 <hi> ejusdem
                significationis.</hi>
                For the <hi>quid rei</hi> next, it
                signifieth
                (as we see by the <hi>Etymologie</hi>)
                <hi>ministerium vel munus publicum,</hi> a
                publick
                charge or ministry in what kind soever, whether it be
                sacred or profane, and is
                so used
                in <hi>Classick</hi>
                and approved
                Authors.
                <hi>Isocrates</hi> in some of his
                Orations,
              
              useth
                the word <hi>pro Magistratuum functione,</hi>
                for the power and office of the Civil Magistrate.
              
              So also doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the
                <hi>Romans,</hi>
                , <hi>for they are
                Gods
                Ministers
                attending
                continually
                upon this very thing:</hi> Sometimes
                it signifieth
                the doing
                or offering
                a mans
                service to the Common-wealth, as ,
              
              in the great <hi>Philosopher:</hi> in which regard such
                wealthy Citizens
                as were
                able to supply the publick
                wants
                from their private Coffers,
                are said
                , to serve the Common-wealth with
                their proper
                goods.
              
              And so the word is
                used
                also by the great Apostle. <hi>For if</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>the Gentiles
                have been
                made
                partakers
                of their spiritual things,
                their duty also is,</hi>
                , <hi>to minister unto
                them
                in carnal things.</hi>
                And in this sense the word is
                taken
                several times
                in the Epistle unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
              
              <hi>viz.</hi> cap. 2. vers. 25.  vers. 30. I might
                here add that 
                is
                used
                in <hi>Polybius</hi> for <hi>munifex in castris,</hi> or
                an
                Engineer; as  in the same Author,
                <hi>pro ministerio castrensi,</hi> for a charge or office
                in the camp; and that in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>
                the word is
                used
                to signifie
                those businesses
                and imployments
                which attend on Marriage; where he
                informeth
                us, that the Married
                state hath
                several duties,
              
              , whereof a
                reckoning
                or accompt must be made
                to God. But these being
                the acceptions
                of the word in the civil sense and
                meaning
                only, I shall pass them
                over.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the sacred sense or meaning
                of it,
              
              we find in <hi>Aristotle</hi> that ,
                are those publick
                offices
                to be performed
                unto the gods
                with expence
                and cost.
              
              From which acception of the word, the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
                made
                use thereof to signifie
                the Worship and Service due to God, who
                is
                not to be Served
                or Worshipped
                but with the best of our Devotions,
                as in the Jewish Church with the best also of their
                substance. The word so used
                by them
                in their Translation of the Old Testament,
                became
                in fine a word of Art or speciality amongst the
                Writers
                of the New. For in the first Chapter of S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s
                Gospel, the Ministry of the Jewish Priesthood
                is
                called
                by the name of ,
              
              as where it is
                said
                of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> how <hi>it
                came
                to pass,</hi> , that <hi>as soon as
                the days
                of his ministration were
                accomplished,
                he departed
                to his own House.</hi> And in the Epistle to the
                <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                S. <hi>Paul</hi> alluding
                to the Ministeries
                of the Jewish Temple, calleth
                our Saviour Christ, , a <hi>Minister
                of the Holies,</hi>
              
              or of the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Thus also in allusion to the
                Ministeries
                of the Church of <hi>Jewry,</hi> the Ministry of the
                Gospel is
                in the Scripture called
                by the selfsame
                name;
              
              the Holy Ghost affirming
                of the Prophets
                which were
                in <hi>Antioch,</hi> , that <hi>they
                ministred
                unto the Lord,</hi> i.e. as <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                expounds
                the word , they
                Preached
                the Gospel; or , they
                made
                their Prayers
                unto the Lord, as the <hi>Syriack</hi>
                Translation hath
                it. Indeed
              
              
              both glosses
                on the word, as well that of the
                <hi>Syriack</hi>
                Interpreters,
                as of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> do yield a fuller
                meaning
                of it (according
                as it is
                now used
                in the Church of Christ) than either of
                them
                taken
                severally;
                the publick
                Liturgies
                of the Church consisting
                both of Prayers
                and Preaching,
                taking
                the word Preaching
                as before I did,
                for the publick
                notifying
                of the will and pleasure of Almighty God,
                touching
                mans
                salvation. In which respect, as the word
                 is
                taken
                many times
                by the Ancient Fathers,
                for a Priest or Bishop, to whom
                the executing
                or performance of divine Offices
                in publick
                did
                belong
                especially,
                as , or , or
                , the Ministers
                of God, of the Holy Altar, of the New Testament, in
                <hi>Basil, Nazianzen,</hi> and others: So that of
                 came
                to be appropriated
                to the performance of those Offices
                which they were
                to execute, or rather to the rule and order by which they
                were
                to be performed.
                And so the word is
                used
                in the Law <hi>Imperial,</hi> in which it
                is
                expresly
                ordered,
                ,
              
              that no man should presume to execute the
                publick
                Liturgy, or to officiate the divine Service of the Church
                in his private house. In which acceptation of the word (as
                it is
                to be taken,
                and no otherwise in our present business) we do define the
                same with the Learned
                <hi>Casaubon,</hi> to be <hi>descriptio quaedam ordinis
                servandi in sacris celebrandis,</hi>
              
              a regulated
                form or order to be observed
                in the officiating
                of divine Service; such as the <hi>Latines</hi>
                call sometimes
                <hi>Officium,</hi> and sometimes
                <hi>Agenda;</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi>
                Writers
                many times
                . And to this definition I assent the
                rather, because I find the same
                approved
                by the adverse party, particularly
                by the Altar of <hi>Damascus,</hi>
              
              the total sum of all that had
                been
                contributed
                in the former times,
                to the disturbance of this Church.
            </p>
            <p>
              This business being
                thus past over, we will prepare our
                selves
                for the following
                search;
              
              beginning
                with the Patriarchs
                before the Law, though not within the compass of my
                undertaking.
                Where if we find not any foot-steps
                of set forms
                of Prayer, it was
                because the
                Sacrifices
                and devotions
                of Gods
                people in those elder times,
                were
                for the most part occasional only; there
                being
                neither place appointed,
                nor set time prescribed,
                for the performance of the same (that we can meet with)
                until the giving
                of the Law by <hi>Moses:</hi>
                Of those the first we have upon Record
                is
                that of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi>
                4. where we are told
                how that <hi>in process of time it
                came
                to pass that</hi> Cain <hi>brought
                of the fruit of the ground an
                offering
                to the Lord; and</hi> Abel <hi>also
                brought
                of the Firstlings
                of his Flock, and of the fat thereof.</hi> In which it
                is
                to be observed
                that this is
                said
                to have been
                done,
                <hi>post multos dies,</hi>
                as the Vulgar, or in process of time, as our
                <hi>English</hi> reads
                it;
              
              but as it is
                in others more near the <hi>Hebrew, in fine dierum,</hi>
                or at the end of days,
                as <hi>Aynsworth</hi> hath
                it. If we demand what time this
                was,
                <hi>Musculus</hi> will inform you, that it
                was
                <hi>post messem,</hi> at the end of Harvest, as
                being
                the most proper time to offer the
                fruits
                of the Earth, which was
                <hi>Cain</hi>'s Oblation. And hereto <hi>Aynsworth</hi>
                doth agree,
              
              a man well versed
                amongst the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                affirming
                thus, that <hi>at the years
                end, men
                were
                wont in most solemn manner, to Sacrifice unto God with
                thanks
                for his Blessings,
                having
                gathered
                in their fruits;</hi>
                which he observeth
                to be the custom of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                also,
              
              according
                to a place of <hi>Aristotle</hi> which
                is
                therein cited.
                So that the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
                was
                occasional
                meerly,
                as unto the time. And for the place, although the
                Scriptures
                tell us nothing of it, as a thing unnecessary to be
                spoken
                of: Yet by the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                we are told,
                that it was
                there where after <hi>Abraham</hi>
                purposed
                to have offered
                <hi>Isaac.</hi> For as they say, <hi>It
                is
                a tradition by the hand of all, that the place
                wherein</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon
                <hi>built
                an
                Altar, in the floor of</hi> Araunah,
              
              <hi>was
                the place where</hi> Abraham <hi>built
                an
                Altar and bound</hi>
                Isaac <hi>upon it; and that was
                the place where</hi> Noah <hi>builded
                after he came
                out of the Ark; and that was
                the Altar whereon</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Abel
                <hi>offered,
                and on it</hi> Adam <hi>the first man
                offered
                an
                offering
                after he was
                created,</hi>
                c. But this being
                of no greater
                certainty
                than the tradition of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                and such as hath
                no ground to stand on; we may conclude, that in these
                early days
                there was
                no set place put apart for Gods
                publick
                service; no greater
                <hi>constat</hi> to be found of that, than of a set and
                prescribed
                time for the doing
                of it. Touching
                the Priest indeed, by whom
                the Offering
                was
                presented
                to Almighty God, there is
                more assurance; that office being
                executed
                by their Father
                <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom
                as to the Father of his Family, it of right
                belonged;
              
              as it did
                afterwards
                under the First-born, to those that
                had
                the priviledge
                of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> until the Priesthood
                was
                by God established
                in the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> For howsoever it be
                said
                by <hi>Paraeus, in illa hominum paucitate, quis{que} ut
                spiritualis sacerdos offerebat,</hi> that in those early
                times,
                when there were
                so few men
                in the world,
              
              every one as a spiritual Priest might tender and present
                his own oblation; yet it is
                only said,
                not proved:
                and doth not only contradict most
                approved
                Writers,
                but seemeth
                also to run cross to the holy
              
              
              
              Scripture. And though we find not in
                Gods
                Book, that in the celebration of this
                offering
                brought
                by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> there
                were
                either Prayers
                or Praises
                intermingled
                with it:
              
              Yet I am
                very apt to think with <hi>Calvin, non inanibus ceremoniis
                illusisse patres,</hi> that the
                Oblations
                offered
                both by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> as
                afterwards
                by other of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
                were
                not meer
                dumb shews,
                a bare and naked ceremony, and no more than so. But
                being
                their devotions
                were
                occasional, as before was
                said,
                we have no reason to presume that they
                had
                any prescript and set form of Prayer, which of congruity
                was
                to change and vary, according
                to the several occasions
                presented
                to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet it seems
                it was
                not long,
              
              before, besides
                the tendry of their Oblations,
                Gods
                Book makes
                mention of a further duty, that of Invocation, the
                calling
                on the name of the Lord their God. In the
                beginning
                of that Chapter, we find <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
                bringing
                their <hi>Offerings
                to the Lord;</hi> and in the end thereof, on the birth of
                <hi>Enos,</hi> we find that <hi>men
                began
                to call on the Name of the Lord.</hi>
              
              Which Text, by reason of the different
                readings,
                and no less differing
                expositions,
                is
                not yet so clear, but that a question may be
                made,
                whether an
                holy and religious Invocation on the Name of God be there
                meant
                or not, and if it be, whether it
                were
                a private or a publick
                duty. For howsoever
                we read it in the Text of our <hi>English</hi>
                Bibles,
                <hi>Then began
                men
                to call on the Name of the Lord;</hi> yet in the Margin it
                is
                otherwise, <hi>Then began
                men
                to call themselves by the Name of the Lord:</hi> And
                <hi>Aynsworth</hi> differing
                from them
                both, <hi>Then began
                men
                to call profanely
                on the Name of</hi> Jehovah. So also for the several
                <hi>Glosses</hi>
                made
                upon the Text (not to insist upon the different
                readings
                either of the <hi>Greek</hi> or
                <hi>Latine</hi>
                Bibles)
                the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase
                had
                it thus, <hi>Tunc in diebus ejus inceperunt filii hominum
                ut non orarent in nomine Domini:</hi>
              
              Then in his days
                began
                the Sons
                of men
                not to invoke or call upon the Name of God; which
                is
                directly
                contrary unto the <hi>English.</hi> S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
                thus according
                to the tendries of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                as himself informs
                us, <hi>Tunc primum in nomine Domini,  in
                similitudine ejus fabricata sunt idola;</hi> then
                began
                men
                to set up Idols
                both in the Name and after the Similitude of God.
              
              <hi>Maymonides</hi>
                one of the Learnedest
                of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                as he is
                vouched
                by <hi>Aynsworth,</hi> thus, That in those
                days
                Idolatry took
                its
                first beginning,
                and the People Worshipped
                the Stars
                and the Host of Heaven. And as for those that do adhere
                unto the reading
                of the vulgar <hi>Latine,</hi>
              
              <hi>Iste coepit invocare nomen Domini,</hi> which
                differs
                very little from the <hi>English</hi> Bible; they are not
                very well agreed
                amongst themselves,
                though most of them
                do agree in this, that it is
                meant
                of publick
                Worship, and which is
                more than so, of set forms
                of worship. <hi>Junius</hi> amongst the
                <hi>Protestants</hi>
                doth conceive it so. <hi>Prius quidem invocavit</hi> Adam,
                <hi>sed in familia; nunc invocarunt multi, sed in
                Ecclesiam recepti.</hi>
              
              <hi>Adam</hi> (saith
                he) did
                in the first beginning,
                call upon the Name of God, but it
                was
                only as it were
                in his private Family: Now began
                many men
                to do the like, but such as were
                assembled
                to that purpose in a Church or body. <hi>Paraeus</hi>
                is
                more plain and positive. <hi>Sed
                an
                prius non fuit invocatum?</hi> Had
                not the Name of God been
                called
                on in the former times?
                Yes that it had,
                saith
                he, but privately
                and by a few. But now the Family of <hi>Seth</hi>
                increasing,
                the Church and the Religion in the same
                professed,
              
              became
                much improved;
                <hi>Et certa cultus forma fuit constituta,</hi> and there
                was
                constituted
                and established
                a set form of Worship. The like <hi>Pererius</hi>
                hath
                for the <hi>Pontificians,</hi>
                who first expounding
                it of the Exemplary piety of <hi>Enos,</hi> by
                preaching
                and instructing
                others in the fear of God, then
                adds,
                that <hi>Enos</hi> is
                first said
                to call upon the Name of the Lord,
              
              <hi>quia iste primus certas quasdam precationum formulas
                condidit,</hi> because
                he was
                the first that did
                compose set forms
                of Prayer, and devised
                several rites
                and ceremonies
                for the advancement of Gods
                Service. Of the same mind also is
                <hi>Torniellus,</hi> as to the gathering
                of Gods
                People into Congregations,
                the setting
                out of certain forms
                of Prayer and Praises
                for the performance of Religious Worship, and the
                appointing
                of set times
                and places
                for those pious duties.
                <hi>Tunc primum institutos fuisse spirituales quosdam
                conventus,  quasdam devotas precationes, puta</hi>
                Psalmos <hi>aut</hi> Hymnos, <hi>in summi Dei laudem,</hi>
              
              <hi>certis temporibus  locis pie cultis, communiter
                recitandos,</hi> as his words
                there are. In which he saith
                no more, in substance, than did
                those before. But where he adds
                <hi>Praecipu diebus Sabbati,</hi> that this
                was
                specially
                observed
                on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day; he
                hath
                not only found a reach beyond his
                fellows,
                but plainly
                contradicted
                what he said
                before in another place; where we are
                told
                that there had
                been
                no sanctifying
                of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> here on earth,
              
              till the time of <hi>Moses,
                quando sub praecepto data est filiis Israel,</hi> when as
                it was
                imposed
                by a Commandment on the House of <hi>Israel.</hi> Thus
                have we found according
                to the Expositions
                of these Learned
                men,
                a prescribed
                form of Common-prayer in the time of <hi>Enos,</hi> even
                in the cradle of the World. But
                being
                the Text hath
                different readings,
                and no less different explications,
                as before was
              
              
              shewn:
                I dare not hold it a fit ground whereon to raise the
                building which I have in hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if we find not here what we have in search,
              
              there is
                but little hope to meet with it, in any of the
                publick
                Acts
                of <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Abraham;</hi>
              
              of both which it is
                said
                that they built
                Altars,
                and offered
                Sacrifice; of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he
                <hi>called
                also on the Name of God.</hi> Of <hi>Isaac,</hi> it
                is
                also said,
                that he <hi>built
                an
                Altar,</hi> and <hi>called
                on the Name of the Lord:</hi> and it
                is
                said
                of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Son of <hi>Isaac,</hi> that he
                built
                two Altars,
                the one at <hi>Bethel,</hi> by the
                Lords
                appointment, the other at <hi>El-Elohe-Israel,</hi> of his
                own devotion. But with what rites
                those Sacrifices
                were
                accompanied,
                which were
                performed
                upon those Altars;
                and in what solemn form of words,
                or whether with any solemn form of
                words
                they did
                pour forth their prayers
                to Almighty God, I am
                not able to determine. Most like it
                is,
                that their Devotions
                being
                occasional, their Prayers
                and Hymns
                were
                fitted
                unto those occasions,
                as before was
                said.
                And that the several Actions
                of Religious
                worship, which are recorded
                of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
                in the Book of God, were
                occasional
                only, without relation either to set
                times
                or places,
                may be easily
                seen,
                by looking
                over the particulars.
                The Sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> as it
                was
                remarkable, so it was
                occasional;
                an
                <hi>Eucharistical</hi> oblation for that great deliverance
                which had
                befallen
                him
                and his Family by Gods
                grace and mercy. And therefore it
                is
                well observed
                by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that presently
                upon his coming
                out of the Ark,  <hi>immolavit
                Deo.</hi>
              
              He offered
                unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and
                paid
                his Vows
                to the most High for so miraculous a safety. The
                Sacrifices
                and other Acts
                of publick
                Worship which are recorded
                in the Scripture of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                were
                occasional also; either in due acknowledgment of
                Gods
                gracious promise made
                unto him,
                at his first entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                Gen. xii. 7. or for his blessings
                on his journey, <hi>ibid.</hi> vers. 8. or on his
                taking
                a livery and seisin of the Promised
                Land, when he sate down and dwelt
                in the plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi> cap. xiii.
                ver.
                18. or on the peace concluded
                betwixt him
                and the King of <hi>Philistims,</hi>
                cap. xxi. v. 33. or finally
                (not to look after other instances)
                on the redemption or reprieve of <hi>Isaac,</hi> Gen.
                xxii. 13. The like we may observe
                in that of <hi>Isaac,</hi> building
                an
                Altar, and calling
                on the Name of God, that it was
                done
                upon the Lords
                appearing
                to him,
                and the gracious comforts
                which he gave
                him,
                <hi>cap.</hi> xxxvi. 25. And why
                did
                <hi>Jacob</hi> offer Sacrifice at <hi>Galeed,</hi> Gen.
                xxxi. v. 48.  54. but on occasion of the League
                concluded
                betwixt him
                and <hi>Laban?</hi> or build an
                Altar at <hi>El-Elobe-Israel,</hi> but in regard that he
                had
                made
                a Pacification with his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> and
                was
                restored
                unto his Countrey?
                <hi>cap.</hi> xxxii. v. 20. So that in all this search
                into particulars,
                the most which we can find is
                this, that they were
                all intent upon building Altars;
                which shews
                that Altars
                were
                no part of the Jewish Ceremonies,
                nor by those holy men
                conceived
                unfit to be imployed
                in the performance of Religious Worship; and that the
                Sacrifices
                made
                upon these Altars,
                were
                intermixed
                with Prayer and Invocation on the Name of God. Of any
                prescript form of Prayer, there
                is
                as little to be found in the former
                instances,
                as of appointed
                either times
                or places
                for the performance of the same; of which we have found
                nothing hitherto in the Book of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not hitherto indeed in any of the
                instances
                before produced,
              
              though one there be which is
                by some supposed
                to reflect that way. <hi>Abrahams
                planting
                of a Grove, and calling
                there upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> Gen. xxi. 33.
                is
                thought by men
                of no mean credit and ability in the
                ways
                of Learning,
                to be the designation of a set and
                appointed
                place, for the officiating
                of Gods
                publick
                Service. <hi>Musculus</hi> doth conceive it so.
              
              <hi>Locum orationis
                 Ecclesiae suae constituit inter Arbores.</hi> And
                <hi>Cajetan</hi> before him
                to the same effect, <hi>Nemus quoddam tanquam templum
                effecit, ut esset oratorium tam sibi quam aliis colentibus
                verum Deum.</hi> Whose judgement in this point
                is
                both recited
                and approved
                by <hi>Pererius</hi> the Jesuite,
                in his Commentaries
                on the Text. They all agree in this, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
                did
                plant that Grove for a Church or Oratory, wherein himself
                and others which were
                so devoted,
                might make their supplications
                to the Lord their God.
              
              But <hi>Calvin</hi> rather thinks
                that <hi>Abraham</hi> having
                setled
                all his differences
                with K. <hi>Abimelech,</hi> did
                plant this Grove, <hi>in signum tranquillae fixae{que}
                habitationis,</hi> to signifie
                that now he had
                a constant
                dwelling
                in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                men
                using
                not to build or plant but where they do intend to set up
                their rest. <hi>Lyra</hi> conceives
                that it was
                planted
                for no other end, than the benefit of shade and fruit, and
                to give entertainment unto Strangers;
              
              <hi>qui amoenitate loci recrearentur,  fructibus
                reficerentur;</hi> to whom
                the pleasures
                of the place, and sweetness of the
                fruits
                must needs
                be equally
                delightful. And this comes
                nearer
                to the <hi>Hebrew Aeshel,</hi> which doth not so much
                signifie
                a Grove, as a well-spread Tree.
              
              
              
              So that the meaning
                of the Text being
                not resolved,
                or if that were,
                the meaning
                of the Text which <hi>Musculus</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi>
                have agreed
                upon; yet being
                it was
                not drawn
                into example by Gods
                faithful Servants
                in the times
                succeeding,
                but only by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                and the Idolatrous <hi>Jews,</hi>
                in their Apostasie
                from God; we dare not from this Text infer a set place of
                worship, or that the following
                Ages
                took
                an
                hint from hence to consecrate appointed
                and determinate places
                for Religious uses.
                But if we look a little lower, into the Life and History
                of <hi>Jacob,</hi> we may perhaps find that which will be
                conclusive. Now it is
                said
                of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that
                when he had
                beheld
                the Vision, <hi>and awaked
                from sleep,</hi> and said,
                <hi>How dreadful is
                this place,</hi> c. that he <hi>rose up early in the
                morning, and took
                the stone which he had
                put for his pillow, and set it up for a Pillar,</hi>
              
              <hi>and poured
                oyl
                on the top of it.</hi> And then, and not till then he
                called
                the name of the place <hi>Bethel,</hi> which by
                interpretation is
                the House of God. <hi>Josephus</hi>
                gives
                this gloss on these words
                of <hi>Moses,</hi>
              
              . <hi>Honorem etiam loco addidit,</hi>
                Bethel <hi>nominando, quod</hi> Graecis <hi>domicilium Dei
                significat.</hi> And this I take
                beyond all
                question, to be the first place
                solemnly
                inaugurated
                for the Worship of God, ordained
                by him
                to be Gods
                House, as it is
                called
                expresly,
                <hi>v.</hi> 22. A place so pleasing
                to the Lord, that he vouchsafed
                to call himself the God of <hi>Bethel. I
                am
                the God of</hi> Bethel, <hi>where thou anointedst the
                Pillar,</hi> Gen. xxxi. 13. And to this place
                did
                <hi>Jacob</hi> go by Gods
                Commandment, to offer Sacrifice to the Lord, and to pay
                his Vows,
                <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxv. Finally,
                to conclude this Chapter, in imitation of this act of
                <hi>Jacob</hi>'s (unless perhaps it
                were
                some remaining
                spark of the light of Nature) the
                <hi>Jews,</hi>
                and after them
                the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                and at last the <hi>Christians</hi>
                have used
                to consecrate their Temples,
                and in them
                their Altars.
                Sure I am
                that <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi> so
                resolves
                it, saying,
                <hi>Altare
                post aspersionem aquae Chrismate ungitur, ad imitationem
                Patriarchae</hi> Jacob <hi>qui post visionem illam
                terribilem,</hi>
              
              <hi>erexit lapidem in titulum, fundens oleum desuper,
                vocans{que} eum locum domum Dei.</hi> But it
                is
                time to pass from these unsetled
                Ages
                of the Church of God, and to behold it in a
                constituted
                and established
                state; where we shall find not only certain and
                determinate places
                and set times
                of worship to be prescribed
                by the Lord; but also certain and
                established
                forms
                of worship to be observed
                amongst Gods
                Servants
                from the first beginnings.

              HItherto we have looked
                into the Actions
                and devotions
                of the blessed
                Patriarchs,
              
              during the time they sojourned
                in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> in which we find not any
                apparent footstep either of appointed
                times
                or determinate places,
                or set forms
                of worship; more than the Consecrating
                of <hi>Jacobs</hi>
                Pillar, and giving
                to the place the
              
              
              name of <hi>Bethel.</hi> Follow
                them
                in their journey towards
                the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and we find <hi>Israel
                offering
                Sacrifices
                at</hi> Beersheba (being
                in his way upon the rode) <hi>unto the God of his
                Father</hi> Isaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlvi. 1. Which Sacrifice,
                if we observe it as we ought,
              
              will prove to be as much occasional as any of the rest
                which we saw
                before: It being
                very well observed
                by <hi>Aynsworth,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> in his
                Sacrifice upon the way, did
                both give thanks
                to God for the good tidings
                which he heard
                of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and also consulted
                with the Lord about his going
                into <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither his Father <hi>Isaac</hi>
                had
                been
                forbidden
                to go in a time of Famine, as this
                was,
                <hi>Gen.</hi> xxvi. Besides,
                <hi>Beersheba</hi> being
                the last Town of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the way
                of <hi>Egypt,</hi> this might be the last time, for ought
                he could tell, wherein he might have opportunity of
                offering
                Sacrifice to the Lord his God, or
                tendring
                to him
                any publick
                testimony of his faith and duty. And so it
                proved
                in the event; nor he nor any one of his Posterity,
                being
                permitted
                whilst they were
                in <hi>Egypt</hi> to offer any Sacrifice unto the Lord, as
                before they used
                to do. And this appears
                by the request which <hi>Moses</hi>
                made
                to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in behalf of the House of
                <hi>Israel,</hi> that he would suffer
                them
                to go <hi>three days
                journey into the Wilderness, to offer Sacrifice
                therein to
                the Lord their God.</hi> To which when <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
                made
                reply,
              
              that rather than let the People go, he would permit
                them
                for that once, to <hi>offer Sacrifice unto the Lord in the
                Land of</hi> Egypt: Not so, said
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                it is
                not meet we should do so; <hi>for we shall
                Sacrifice
                the abomination of the</hi> Egyptians
                <hi>before their eyes,
                and they will stone us.</hi>
              
              His reason was,
                because the Gods
                of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                were
                Bulls
                and Rams,
                and Sheep and Oxen,
                as <hi>Lyra</hi> notes
                upon the place. <hi>Talia vero animalia ab</hi> Hebraeis
                <hi>erailt immolanda,</hi>
              
              <hi>quod non permisissent</hi> Aegyptii <hi>in
                terrasua.</hi> And certainly
                the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                could not well endure to see their
                gods
                knocked
                down before their faces.
                So that for all the time that they
                lived
                in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the piety and devotion of
                Gods
                people did
                consist especially
                in the integrity
                and honesty of their conversation and in those private
                exercises
                of Religion which might be done
                within their own walls,
                in their several Families.
                Nothing to make it known
                that they were
                Gods
                Servants,
                , as it is
                observed
                by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but that they
                feared
                the Lord and were
                Circumcised;
              
              nothing but that they did
                acknowledge one only God, and exercised
                themselves in justice and in modesty, in patience and
                long-suffering
                both towards
                one another and amongst the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
                framing
                their lives
                agreeably
                unto the will of God, and the law of Nature.

              But no sooner,
                by a mighty hand and an
                out-stretched
                arm,
              
              had
                God delivered
                them
                from thence, but he disposed
                them,
                being
                now grown
                numerous (like to the Stars
                in Heaven for numbers)
                into a constituted
                Church; appointing
                them
                set times
                and places
                for Religious Worship, ordaining
                a peculiar Priesthood for his publick
                service, prescribing
                with what Rites
                and Ceremonies
                that publick
                service, that religious worship
                was
                to be performed.
                And first the time appointed
                for this purpose, was
                the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi>
              
              the keeping
                of the which was
                the first of the Commandments
                which God gave
                by <hi>Moses;</hi>
                from whence the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                Doctors
                say, that the Commandment of the <hi>Sabath</hi>
                is
                the foundation and ground of all the rest, <hi>quod ante
                alia praecepta hoc datum sit, quando</hi> Manna
                <hi>acceperunt,</hi> as being
                given
                before them
                all in the fall of Manna.
              
              A day to be observed
                and sanctified,
                both by Priest and People; by the Priest in
                adding
                to the daily Sacrifice an
                offering
                of two Lambs
                of an
                year old without blemish, one in the morning, and the
                other in the evening; and by the people in
                an
                absolute resting
                from the works
                of labour, that they might give themselves the better to
                divine contemplation.
                Unto which day it pleased
                God afterwards
                to adde
                divers
                solemn Festivals
                to be observed
                in their several and appointed
                seasons,
                <hi>viz.</hi> the New-moons,
              
              the Feasts
                of Trumpets,
                and of Tabernacles,
                the Feasts
                of Pentecost, and of the Passeover;
                although this last had
                the precedency indeed, both in regard of institution, and
                of observation
                over all the rest; this being
                both ordained
                and kept
                at their departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the other not
                enjoyned
                till they were
                come unto mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> even in the
                bowels
                of the Wilderness. The times
                being
                thus appointed
                and determined,
              
              the next particular we meet withal,
                is
                the designation of the place, which
                was
                contrived
                by the direction of Almighty God,
                according
                to the present condition of his People. For
                being
                they were
                then in motion towards
                <hi>Canaan,</hi> not yet setled
                there, they were
                to be provided
                of a portable Temple, if I may so call it, which might be
                carried
                and removed,
                according
                to the stations
                and removes
                of <hi>Israel.</hi> This we find
                called
                in holy Scripture by the name of the Tabernacle, the
                Tabernacle ,
              
              and by way of eminency; the making
                and materials
                of the which are layed
                down at large in the xxvi. Chapter of the Book of
                <hi>Exodus.</hi> And it continued
                a long time the place of publick
                Worship for the Tribes
                of <hi>Israel,</hi> not only when they
                were
                in their way or journeys;
              
              
              
              but also after they were
                setled
                in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though many
                times
                it changed
                its
                seat there, as occasion was,
                even till the building of the Temple by the hand of
                <hi>Salomon.</hi>
                And for the Priests
                who were
                to minister unto the Lord in his Congregation, no
                sooner
                were
                the times
                determined,
                and the place designed,
                but the Lord gave
                command to
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                saying,
                <hi>Take thou unto thee</hi>
                Aaron <hi>thy Brother, and his Sons
                with him,
                from amongst the Children
                of</hi> Israel,
              
              <hi>that he may minister unto me in the
                Priests
                office.</hi> Unto which office as they
                were
                designed
                by these words
                of God, so were
                they after consecrated
                thereunto in a solemn form, by the hand of
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                the state and manner of the which
                is
                upon record in the viii. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
                And now, and not till now, were
                the Tribes
                of <hi>Israel</hi> established
                in a Constituted
                Church by the Lord their God.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as once <hi>Isaac</hi> said
                to <hi>Abraham, Behold the fire and the wood, but where
                is
                the Lamb for a Burnt-offering?</hi>
              
              
              So here we have the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the solemn
                Festivals,
                the Tabernacle and the Priests;
                but where are the Sacrifices
                all this while, where the forms
                of worship? That now comes
                after in its
                course; and that we will consider in
                its
                full extent, either as legal, or as moral. First for the
                legal part thereof, it was
                all prescribed;
                nothing left arbitrary to the people, either for the
                matter or the manner. God knew
                full well, that as they had
                been
                much infected
                with the Idolatries
                of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they lived
                before,
                (witness the Golden Calf which they
                made
                in <hi>Horeb</hi>) so they were
                apt to be intangled
                in the Idolatries
                of those Nations
                which they were
                to neighbour; and therefore
                thought it fittest
                for them
                to be tyed
                up and limited
                in all acts
                of worship, by his prescriptions.
                Which that we may the better see, I shall present a brief
                <hi>Synopsis</hi> of those rites
                and ceremonies
                which were
                to be observed
                in these legal Sacrifices,
                together with the Creatures
                to be Sacrificed;
                according
                as I find them
                in <hi>Josephus,</hi> who hath
                reduced
                into a lesser compass, that which
                is
                laid
                down more at large in the holy Scriptures.
                ,
              
              c. <hi>The Sacrifices
                are of two sorts;
                the one of them
                is
                made
                for a private
                person, the other for the people in general; and these are
                made
                in two manners,
                for in the one all is
                consumed
                which is
                upon the Altar, which for that cause
                is
                called
                an</hi>
                Holocaust, <hi>or an
                whole Burnt-offering;
                the other is</hi>
                Eucharistical <hi>or of thanksgiving, and they are
                made
                with Feasts
                by those that Sacrifice. The particular person that
                offered
                a Burnt-offering,
                killed
                an
                Oxe,
                a Lamb, or a Goat of an
                year old (yet it was
                lawful to kill an
                Oxe
                of greater
                age) being
                all Males:
                And after their Throats
                are cut, the Priests
                besprinkle the Altar round about with the blood, then they
                dress the Beast, and cut it in pieces,
                and season it with salt, and lay it on the Altar ready
                prepared
                with wood and fire; and having
                well cleansed
                the feet
                and entrails,
                they lay them
                with the rest, and the Priest taketh
                the skins.
                They that offer the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, kill
                likewise such sorts
                of Beasts
                without spot, and more than a year old, both Male and
                Female; and after they have cut the
                throats,
                they sprinkle the blood on the Altar, then they take the
                reins,
                the caul, and the fat, with the caul about the liver, and
                the rump, and lay it on the Altar, but the breast and the
                left leg is
                left unto the Priests;
                and as touching
                the rest of the flesh, the Priests
                feast therewith for the space of two
                days,
                and if then there remain any thing thereof, it
                is
                burned.
                The same is
                also observed
                in the Sin-offering;
                but those that are not of ability to make these
                greater
                offerings,
                do bring unto the Offerings
                a pair of Pigeons,
                or two young Turtles,
                the one of which the Priests
                have to feast withal, the other
                is
                consumed
                with sire. He that hath
                sinned
                upon Ignorance, offereth
                a Lamb and a she Goat at the same time; and the Priest
                besprinkleth
                the Altar with the blood thereof, not in the same manner
                as before, but the horns
                only of the Altar; and on the Altar they offer the
                kidneys
                with the rest of the fat and the caul of the liver; the
                Priests
                carrying
                away the skins,
                and eating
                the flesh within
                the Tabernacle the very same day, because the Law
                permitteth
                not to reserve any thing until the next. He that
                hath
                sinned
                (none but himself being
                privie
                to it) offereth
                a Lamb according
                as the Law commandeth,
                the flesh whereof is
                eaten
                in like sort by the Priests
                the same very day. But if the Princes
                of the People offer for their sins,
                they do in like sort as others do, save that they bring a
                Bull or a Male-kid. The Law also
                ordaineth
                that in all Sacrifices
                both private
                and common, there should be a certain quantity of fine
                flower brought,</hi>
                viz. <hi>for a Lamb one</hi> Assar,
              
              <hi>for a Ram two, for a Bull three, which
                is
                first of all mingled
                and wrought
                with oyle,
                and then set upon the Altar to be
                sanctified.
                They that Sacrifice do likewise bring
                oyle,
                the balf part of an</hi>
                Hin <hi>for a Bull; for a Ram, the third part; for a Lamb
                the fourth: They brought
                also the like measure of wine, as of
                oyle,
                and poured
                the wine near to the Altar. And if any without
                Sacrificing,
                offer up fine flower, he putteth
                the first fruits
                upon the Altar, that is
                to say, one handful of it; and the rest
                is
                taken
                by the Priests,
                either fryed
                (for it is
                kneaded
                with oyl)
                or in loaves
                made
                thereof. But whatsoever the Priest
                offereth,
                that must all be hurnt. The Law likewise
                forbiddeth
                to offer any Beast whatever the same day it
                is
                born, or to kill it with its
                Dam, or in any other sort, before it
                hath
                fed
                twelve days.
                There are also
              
              
              other Sacrifices
                made
                for deliverance from sickness, or for other
                causes;
                in which Sacrifices
                they imploy
                wine or liquor
                with that which is
                offered,
                of which liquors
                it is
                not lawful to reserve
                any thing till the next day, when the
                Priests
                have taken
                that portion which belongeth
                to them.
                So far</hi> Josephus.

            <p>
              The rest that followeth
                of this Argument is,
              
              a recital of those Sacrifices
                which were
                appointed
                for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the other
                Festivals;
                in all which every thing was
                prescribed
                and limited
                by the Law of God. And if such care
                was
                taken
                by the Lord our God in the prescribing
                of these Sacrifices,
                and all the Rites
                and Ceremonies
                which belonged
                to them,
                being
                the legal part only of this publick
                worship; there is
                no question to be made
                but that the Church took
                care to prescribe forms
                of Prayers
                and Praises
                to be used
                in them,
                which is
                the moral part thereof. A thing which God might please to
                leave unto the wisdom of his Church and the
                Rulers
                of it, in that being
                moral duties,
                and so by consequence imprinted
                in the minds
                of men,
                by the stamp of nature; there needed
                not so punctual and precise a prescription of
                them,
                as of the outward ceremonies
                which were
                meerly
                legal. Now that there were
                set forms
                of Prayers
                and Praises
                used
                in the celebratien of these legal
                Sacrifices,
                even from the very times
                of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                appeareth
                by a memorable passage in an
                old <hi>Samaritan</hi> Chronicle,
                belonging
                once unto the Library of <hi>Joseph Scaliger,</hi> now in
                the custody of the Learned
                Primate of <hi>Armagh.</hi> In which Book, after relation
                of the death of <hi>Adrian</hi> the
                Emperour,
                whom
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                curse with <hi>Conterat Deus ossa ejus</hi> (as
                certainly
                he was
                a deadly enemy of theirs) it followeth
                thus. <hi>Quo tempore abstulit librum optimum qui penes
                illos fuit,</hi>
              
              <hi>jam inde  diebus illis tranquillis 
                pacificis, qui continebat cantiones </hi> preces
                <hi>sacrificiis praemissas; Singulis enim</hi> Sacrificiis
                <hi>singulas praemiserunt</hi> cantiones, <hi>jam tum
                diebus pacis usitatas, quae omnia acourato conscripta, in

                tempore Legati</hi> (Mosis sc.) <hi>ad hunc us{que} diem
                per ministerium Pontificum Maximorum.</hi> These are the
                words
                at large as I find them
                cited;
                the substance of the which is
                this, <hi>That after the decease of</hi> Adrian, <hi>the
                High Priest then being,
                took
                away that most excellent Book, which
                had
                been
                kept
                amongst them
                ever since the calm and peaceable
                times
                of the</hi> Israelites,
                <hi>which contained
                those Songs
                and Prayers
                which were
                ever used
                before their Sacrifices,
                there being
                before every several Sacrifice some several Song or Hymn
                still used
                in those times
                of peace; all which being
                accurately
                written
                had
                been
                transmitted
                to the subsequent generations
                from the time of</hi> Moses
                <hi>the Legat,
                or Ambassador of God, to that very time, by the Ministry
                of the High Priests
                of the Jewish Nation.</hi> A book to which the Chronicle
                aforesaid gives
                this ample testimony, <hi>Eo libro historia nulla praeter
                Pentateuchum</hi> Mosis <hi>antiquior invenitur,</hi> that
                there was
                not to be found a more antient
                piece, except the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> of
                Moses.
                And though some men,
                (no friends
                to Liturgy) out of a mind and purpose to disgrace the
                evidence, have told
                us, that the most contained
                in the aforesaid book,
              
              <hi>were
                only divine Hymns,
                wherein there was
                always
                something of Prayer:</hi> In saying
                so, they have given
                up their verdict for us, and confirmed
                our evidence. For if there were
                set Hymns
                or Songs
                premised
                before every Sacrifice; and if that every Hymn
                had
                somewhat in it of a Prayer, there must be then set
                forms
                of Hymns
                and Prayers
                used
                at every Sacrifice, which was
                the matter to be proved,
                and by them
                denied.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to descend unto particulars;
                there was
                a Song composed
                and sung
                by <hi>Moses,</hi>
              
              
              on the defeat of <hi>Pharoah</hi>
                and the host of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which
                is
                still extant in Gods
                book. A song sung
                Quire-wise, as it seemeth,
                <hi>Moses</hi>
                as Chanter in that holy Anthem,
                singing
                verse by verse, and <hi>Mary</hi> the Prophetess,
                <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sister, and all the residue of the
                Women,
                with Instruments
                of Musick
                in their hands,
                saying
                or singing
                at each verses
                end, <hi>CANTATE DOMINO, Sing ye to the Lord, for he
                hath
                triumphed
                gloriously,
                the horse and the rider hath
                he thrown
                into the Sea,</hi> vers. 21. <hi>Aynsworth</hi> doth so
                conceive it in his Notes
                on <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> on the place
                differs
                little from it. <hi>Egressae sunt
                mulieres,
                quibus</hi> (Maria) <hi>praecinebat, sec. quod oportebat
                fieri,  aliae respondebant sicut solet fieri in
                tympanis  choris;  eodem modo fecit</hi>
                Moyses
                <hi>respecu virorum. Cajetan,</hi> though he differ from
                them
                both in the manner of it, yet he
                agrees
                upon the matter, that this Hymn or Anthem
                was
                sung
                Quire-wise or <hi>alternatim;</hi> it
                being
                his opinion, that the Women
                singing
                some spiritual song to the praise of God,
              
              <hi>Mary</hi> to every verse made
                answer <hi>CANTATE DOMINO. Innuitur</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>quod tot choris mulierum tanquam ex una
                parte,
                canentibus aliquid in divinam laudem,</hi> Maria <hi>sola
                tanquam ex altera parte
                canebat initium supra scripti Cantici;</hi> that
                <hi>viz.</hi> which was
                sung
                by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                But whatsoever manner
                there was
                used
                in the singing
                of it, it seems
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                did
                afterwards
                make Use thereof
                in their publick
                Liturgy. For thus saith
                <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Book of <hi>Ecclesiastical
                Polity:</hi>
              
              <hi>That very Hymn of</hi> Moses
                <hi>(whereof now we speak) grew
                afterwards
                to be a part of the
              
              
              
              ordinary</hi> Jewish <hi>Liturgie,
                and not that only, but sundry others since
                invented;
                their Books
                of Common prayer containing
                partly Hymns,
                taken
                out of the holy Scriptures,
                partly Thanksgivings,
                Benedictions,
                and Supplications,
                penned
                by such as were
                from time to time the Governors
                of that Synagogue. All which were
                sorted
                into several times
                and places;
                some to begin the Service of God withal, and some to end;
                some to go before, and some to follow after, and some to
                be interlaced
                between the divine readings
                of the Law and Prophets.
                Nor is
                there any thing more probable than that unto their custom
                of finishing
                the Passeover
                with certain</hi> Psalms,
                <hi>the holy Evangelist doth evidently
                allude, saying,
                That after the Cup delivered
                by our Saviour
                unto his Apostles,
                they sung,
                and so went
                forth to the Mount of</hi> Olives.
            </p>
            <p>
              What ground that eminent and learned
                man had
                for the first part of his Assertion,
              
              <hi>viz</hi> That the song of <hi>Moses</hi>
                grew
                afterwards
                to be a part of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Liturgy,
                although he
                hath
                not pleased
                to let us know; yet I am
                confident he had
                good ground for what he said.
                But for the latter part thereof, that the Evangelist doth
                allude unto
                certain <hi>Psalms</hi>
                used
                at the finishing
                of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passeover;
                I think there is
                not any thing more clear and evident. For proof whereof,
                and that we may the better see with what set form of
                Prayers
                and Praises
                the Passeover
                was
                celebrated
                by the <hi>Jews</hi>
                of old;
              
              we will make bold to use the words
                of <hi>Joseph Scaliger,</hi> who
                describes
                it thus: <hi>All things
                being
                readily
                prepared,
                and the guests
                assembled,</hi>
                Offam azymam in Embamma intingebat Paterfamilias,
                <hi>c. The Father of the Family, or Master of the
                House dipped
                the unleavened bread into the sawce,
                which was
                forthwith eaten.
                Another part thereof being
                carefully
                reserved
                under a napkin, was
                broke
                into as many pieces
                as there were
                several guests
                in the Paschal Chamber; each piece
                being
                of the bigness of an
                Olive, and each delivered
                severally
                to the guests,
                as they sate in order. That done,
                he takes
                the Cup, and having
                drank
                thereof, gives
                it to the next, he to a second, and so in order to the
                rest, till they all had
                drank.
                The form of Blessing
                which he used
                was
                this,</hi> Benedictus es Domine Deus noster, Rex seculi,
                qui sanctificasti nos mandatis tuis,  praeceptum
                dedisti super hoc pane Azymo. <hi>Blessed
                art thou O Lord our God, King of all the world, which
                hast
                sanctified
                us with thy holy precepts,
                and given
                us this Commandement
                about the eating
                of unleavened bread. And at the
                giving
                of the bread, this form,</hi> Iste est
                panis
                aerumnae quem comederunt patres nostri in terra Aegypti.
                Quisquis esurit, accedat  paschatizet. <hi>This
                is
                the bread of sorrow which our Fathers
                eat when they were
                in</hi> Egypt. <hi>Whosoever is
                an
                hungred
                let him
                come and eat this Passeover.
                The formal words
                used
                at the blessing
                of the Cup, were
                these,</hi> Benedictus es Domine qui fructum vitis
                creasti, <hi>Blessed
                art thou, O Lord, which hast
                Created
                the fruit of the Vine.</hi> And this
                is
                called
                , the Cup of Praise, because whilst it
                was
                passing
                round about the Table, they sung
                an
                Hymn of Praise to the Lord their God.
                Finally,
                Supper being
                done,
                and all the Ceremonies
                ended,
                they sung
                the cxiii <hi>Psalm,</hi> and so
                dismissed
                the Assembly.
                So far the great and famous <hi>Scaliger.</hi> This last
                affirmed
                also by <hi>Paulus Brugensis,</hi> who
                addeth
                that this Psalm (being
                the cxii. in his accompt) with the five that follow, are
                by the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                made
                into one Hymn, and called
                <hi>Allelujah
                magnum;</hi>
              
              and that they use to sing the same not only at the
                conclusion
                of the Passeover
                (as it is
                observed
                by <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi>) but also in the New
                Moons,
                and the three great Feasts
                (<hi>in tribus praecipuis festis  in neomeniis</hi>)
                those, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the
                <hi>Trumpets,</hi>
                and the feasts
                of <hi>Tabernacles</hi>
                and finally,
                that Christ our Saviour conforming
                to the forms
                established,
                <hi>Post comestionem agni Paschalis, hymnum praedictum cum
                Apostolis recitavit,</hi> did
                after the eating
                of the Paschal Lamb, sing the said
                Hymn with his Apostles.

              This though it make it clear and evident,
              
              that at the Celebrating
                of the Passeover,
                the Jews
                had
                their prescribed
                forms
                of Prayer and Praise, and Benediction; yet for the more
                validity thereof, we will relate the same out of
                <hi>Beza</hi> also; whose words
                we will lay down at large without alteration.
              <q>
                <hi>Sciendum</hi> (saith
                  he) <hi>agitata fuisse haec convivia in privatis
                  aedibus</hi> ,
                
                i.e. <hi>per contubernia, non paucorum quam denum
                  virorum, interdum etiam vicenum, qui nisi pedibus de
                  more lotis, totos etiam nonnulli
                  corporibus,
                  non sedebant, sed discumbebant, Agno illo solido cum
                  panibus Azymis vescentes. Hac autem
                  coena peracta consurgentes, altera pedum
                  ablutione
                  facta rursum discumbentes ad secundas
                  mensas sese comparabant. In has
                  vero secundas mensas pro bellariis inferebantur in
                  triblio Acetarium, ex intybis  lactucis agrestibus;
                  quarum amaritudinem adhibito quodam
                  embammate temperabant. Tum vero Paterfamilias panem
                  Azymum integrum in duas partes
                  dividens, sic uni benedicebat,</hi> Benedictus es

                  servabat:
                  quo peracto, idem Paterfamilias alteram illam partem
                  depremens, in tot frusta fractam quot erant in illo
                  contubernio convivatores, primus ipse sumebat, reliqua
                  vero frusta
                
                
                sigillatim  ordine discumbentibus caeteris
                  porrigebat, cum his verbis:</hi> Iste est

              The <hi>English</hi> of this <hi>Latine,</hi>
                as to the sum and substance of it, we have
                seen
                before in that of <hi>Scaliger;</hi> and shall see more at
                large in that which followeth.
                In the mean time, without all peradventure, we have found
                a Liturgy, an
                order of Celebrating
                that holy Sacrament, consisting
                both of Rules
                and Rubricks,
                for the performing
                of the service; as also of those
                forms
                of Prayer, and Praise, and Benediction,
                wherewith that service was
                performed.
                And lest perhaps it may be said
                that these were
                some of the traditions
                of the Scribes
                and Pharisees,
                devised
                in the declining
                and corrupted
                Ages
                of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church: <hi>Beza</hi>
                assures
                us it is
                no such matter; but that these rites
                and forms
                had
                been
                used
                amongst them,
                <hi> primo in Chananitidem
                ingressu,</hi>
                from their first entrance into the Land of
                <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was
                assoon directly,
              
              as they were
                a Church.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make the matter surer
                yet,
              
              we will observe the form and order of the <hi>Jewish</hi>
                Passeover,
                according
                as it is
                described
                at large by <hi>Aynsworth,</hi> out of the
                writings
                of the <hi>Rabbins,
                I will here shew,</hi>
                saith
                he, <hi>the order which the</hi>
                Jews
                <hi>in the Ages
                following,</hi>
              
              <hi>kept
                at the Passeover,
                as themselves have recorded
                it. First a cup of Wine is
                filled
                for every one, and he blesseth
                for it him
                that Created
                the fruit of the Vine,</hi> c. <hi>and
                drinketh
                it. After that, he blesseth
                for the washing
                of hands,
                and washeth
                his hands.
                Then is
                brought
                in a Table furnished,
                and upon it bitter herbs
                and unleavened bread, and the sawce,
                and the body of the Paschal Lamb, and the flesh of
                the</hi> Chagigah <hi>or Feast-offering,
                which is
                for the fourteenth
                day of the moneth.
                Then he beginneth
                to</hi> bless God which Created
                the fruit of the earth, <hi>and
                takes
                an
                herb and dippeth
                it in the sawce,
                and eateth
                it, he and all that lie at the Table, every one; none
                eateth
                less than the quantity of an
                Olive. Afterward the Table is
                taken
                away from before him
                only that maketh
                the declaration (of their deliverance out of</hi> Egypt,
                <hi>as is
                commanded,</hi>
                Exod. xiii.  xii. 17.) <hi>Then they fill the second
                Cup, and the Son asketh</hi>
                what is
                meant
                by this service (<hi>according
                to</hi> Exod. xii. 26.) <hi>and he that
                maketh
                the declaration saith,</hi>
                How different is
                this night from all other nights?
                For all other nights
                we wash but once, but this night twice. All other
                nights
                we eat leavened
                bread or unleavened, but this night unleavened bread only.
                All other nights
                we eat flesh roasted,
                baked
                or boiled,
                but this night roasted
                only; all other nights
                we eat of any other herbs,
                but this night bitter herbs:
                All other nights
                we eat either sitting
                or lying,
                but this night lying
                only. <hi>Then the Table is
                brought
                again before him,
                and be saith,</hi>
                This Passeover
                which we eat, is
                in respect that the Lord passed
                over the Houses
                of our Fathers
                in <hi>Egypt. Then holdeth
                be up the bitter herbs
                in his hand, and saith,</hi>
                These bitter herbs
                which we eat are in respect that the
                <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                made
                the lives
                of our Fathers
                bitter in <hi>Egypt. Then he holdeth
                up the unleavened bread in his hand, and
                saith,</hi>
                This unleavened bread which we eat,
                is
                in respect that the dough of our
                Fathers
                had
                not time to be leavened,
                when the Lord appeared
                unto them,
                and redeemed
                them
                out of the hand of the Enemy; <hi>and they
                baked
                unleavened</hi> Cakes
                of the dough which they brought
                out of <hi>Egypt. Then be saith,</hi>
                Therefore are we bound
                to Confess, to Praise, to Laud, to Celebrate, to
                Glorifie,
                to Honour, to Extol, to Magnifie,
                and to Ascribe Victory unto him
                that did
                unfreedom,
                from sorrow to joy, from darkness to great light; and we
                say before him
                <hi>Hallelujah, Hallelujab, Praise O ye
                Servants
                of the Lord,</hi> c. unto the end of the cxiv.
                <hi>Psalm. Then they bless the Lord which
                redeemed
                them
                and their Fathers
                out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and hath
                brought
                them
                unto that night to eat unleavened bread therein, and
                bitter herbs.
                And he</hi> blesseth
                God who Created
                the fruit of the Vine, <hi>and drinketh
                the second Cup. After this he blesseth
                for the washing
                of hands,
                and washeth
                his hands
                the second time; and taketh
                two Cakes,
                parteth
                one of them,</hi>
                c. <hi>and</hi> blesseth
                God that bringeth bread out of the Earth. <hi>Because it
                is
                said
                the Bread of Affliction, or of Poverty,</hi> Deut. xvi. 3.
                <hi>As it is
                the manner of the Poor to have broken
                meat, so here is
                a broken
                part. Afterwards
                he wrappeth
                up of the unleavened
                bread and of the bitter herbs
                together, and dippeth
                them
                in the sawce,
                and blesseth
                God which commanded
                to eat unleavened bread and bitter
                herbs,
                and they eat. Then he blesseth
                God which commanded
                the eating
                of the Sacrifice, and he eateth
                the flesh of the Feast-offering;
              
              
              
              and again blesseth
                God which commanded
                the eating
                of the Passeover,
                and then he eateth
                of the body of the Passeover.
                After this they sit long at Supper, and eat every one so
                much as he will, and drink as much as they will drink.
                Afterward he eateth
                of the flesh of the Passeover,
                though it be but so much as an
                Olive; and tasteth
                nothing at all after it; that it may be the end of his
                supper, and that the taste of the flesh of the
                Passeover
                may remain in his mouth. After this, he
                lifteth
                up his bands
                and blesseth
                for the third cup of Wine, and drinketh
                it. Then filleth
                he the fourth cup, and accomplisheth
                for it the Praise (or hymn) and
                saith
                for it the blessing
                of the song, which is,</hi>
                All thy works
                praise thee,
                O Lord, <hi>c.</hi> Psal. cxlv. 10. <hi>and</hi>
                blesseth
                God that Created
                the fruit of the Vine, <hi>and tasteth
                nothing at all after it all the night, except water. And
                he may fill the fifth cup, saying</hi>
                (<hi>for it is
                the</hi> great Hymn, <hi>viz.</hi>) Confess ye to the
                Lord, for he is
                good, for his mercy endureth
                for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxvi. <hi>unto the end of that
                Psalm. But he is
                not bound
                (they say) to that cup as to the four farmer
                cups.</hi>
                For this he citeth
                <hi>Rabbi Maymoni,</hi> and after
                addeth
                from the said
                Author (but from another work of his) <hi>That at the
                breaking
                and delivering
                of the unleavened
                bread, they do use these words,</hi>
                This is
                the Bread of Affliction which our
                Fathers
                did
                eat in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Whosoever
                is
                hungry, let him
                come and eat; whosoever
                hath
                need, let him
                come and keep the Passeover,
                <hi>c.</hi> Compare the words
                which follow after, <hi>viz. These
                observations
                of the</hi> Jews
                <hi>whilst their Common-wealth stood,</hi>
                c. with those of <hi>Beza</hi>
                formerly
                remembred,
                <hi> primo in Chananitidem ingressu;</hi> and then
                we have an
                Answer to the doubt which might be
                raised
                from the first words
                of <hi>Aynsworth</hi> in these observations;
                which seem to intimate, that <hi>this Order
                was
                not used
                by the</hi> Jews
                <hi>till the Ages
                following.</hi>
                The Prayers,
                the Praises,
                and the Benedictions
                which are the points
                which <hi>Beza</hi> speaks
                of, might be and were
                used
                by them
                at their first entrance on the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                their frequent washings
                and reiterating
                of the Cup so often, might not be
                introduced
                till the Ages
                following.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here then we have set forms
                of Prayer and Praise,
              
              and Benediction used
                at the Celebrating
                of the Jewish Sacrifices;
                the Song of <hi>Moses</hi>
                made
                a part of the Jewish Liturgy, the several
                rites
                and prescribed
                duties
                observed
                in the solemnity of the Jewish Passover,
                and all of very great Antiquity, even from the time of
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                saith
                the old <hi>Samaritan</hi>
                Chronicle; <hi> primo in
                Chananitidemingressu,</hi> from their first entrance into
                the Promised
                Land, as it is
                in <hi>Beza.</hi> And for the instituting
                of these forms,
                besides
                the power that God hath
                given
                unto his Church on the like occasions,
                they had
                the president
                and example of the Lord himself, who
                had
                prescribed
                in one kind, binding
                the Priests
                unto a certain form of Benediction, when he
                blessed
                the people; and in a second
                place of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                who had
                tied
                himself unto a certain form of words,
                as often as he setled
                or removed
                the Ark. For we are told
                in holy Scripture, that whensoever the Ark set
                forwards,
                <hi>Moses</hi>
                said,
                <hi>Rise up Lord, and let thine
                Enemies
                he scattered,
                and let them
                that hate thee
                flee before thee.</hi>
                And when it rested
                he said,
                <hi>Return O Lord unto the many
                thousands
                of</hi> Israel.
              
              And for the blessing
                of the people, we find the form thereof
                prescribed
                by the Lord himself, saying
                unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons,
                <hi>On this wise shall ye bless the
                Children
                of</hi> Israel, <hi>saying
                unto them,
                The Lord bless thee
                and keep thee;
                the Lord make his Face to shine upon
                thee,
                and be gracious unto thee,
                the Lord lift up his Countenance upon
                thee,
                and give thee
                peace.</hi>
              
              And to this form the Priests
                were
                so precifely tied,
                that they durst
                not vary from the same, the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                Doctors
                understanding
                the word <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>in this wise,</hi> to imply
                both the matter and the manner, as <hi>viz. Thus shall ye
                bless,</hi> i.e. <hi>standing,
                thus, with the lifting
                up of hands;
                thus, in the holy tongue; thus, with your
                faces
                towards
                the faces
                of the people; thus, with an
                high voice; thus, by Gods
                expressed
                Name</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>if ye bless in the Sanctuary.</hi>
                So that it was
                not lawful to the Priest in any place to add any
                blessing
                unto these three verses,
                as to say (like that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.11.) <hi>The Lord
                God of your Fathers
                make you a thousand times
                so many more as you are,</hi> or any the like.
              
              Now for the manner wherewithal the
                Priests
                performed
                this office, it was
                briefly
                thus. <hi>The Priests
                went
                up unto the bank or stage, after that they
                had
                finished
                the daily morning
                Service, and lifted
                up their hands
                on high above their heads,
                and their fingers
                spread abroad,
                except the High-Priest, who might not lift his
                hands
                higher
                than the Plate (whereof see</hi> Exod. xxviii. 36.)
                <hi>and one pronounced
                the blessing
                word by word, till the three verses
                were
                ended.
                And the people answered
                not after every verse, but they
                made
                it in the Sanctuary one blessing.
                And when they had
                finished,
                all the people answered,</hi>
                Blessed
                be the Lord God, the God of <hi>Israel</hi> for ever and
                ever.
              
              By which we may preceive most clearly,
                first that the Priests
                were
                tyed
                precisely
                to a form of blessing,
                prescribed
                by the Lord himself. And secondly,
                that to this form of blessing
                thus prescribed
                by God, the Church did
                after add of her own Authority, not only several external
                and significant rites,
                but a
              
              
              whole clause to be subjoyned
                by the people, after the Priest
                had
                done
                his part. Now as the Priests
                were
                limited
                by Almighty God unto a set and prescribed
                form, wherewith
                they were
                to bless the people in the Name of God: So
                did
                he also set a form unto the People; in which they
                were
                to pay their Tithes
                and First-fruits
                to the Lord their God, towards
                the maintenance of the Priests.
                First for the form used
                at the oblation of the First-fruits,
                it was
                this that followeth:
                (the words
                being
                spoke
                unto the Priest) <hi>I profess this day unto the Lord thy
                God, that I am
                come unto the Countrey,
                which the Lord sware
                unto our Fathers
                to give us.</hi> Which said,
                and the Oblation being
                placed
                by the Priest before the Altar, the party which
                brought
                it was
                to say, <hi>A</hi> Syrian <hi>ready to perish
                was
                my Father, and he went
                down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and sojourned
                there with a few, and became
                there a Nation, great, mighty and populous. And the</hi>
                Egyptians
                <hi>evil intreated
                us and afflicted
                us, and laid
                upon us hard bondage. And when we
                cryed
                unto the Lord God of our Fathers,
                the Lord beard our voice, and looked
                on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression. And
                the Lord brought
                us forth of</hi> Egypt <hi>with a mighty hand; and with
                an
                out-stretched
                arm, and with great terribleness, and with
                signs
                and with wonders.
                And he hath
                brought
                us into this place, and hath
                given
                us this Land, even a Land that floweth
                with Milk and Honey. And now behold I have
                brought
                the First-fruits
                of the Land, which thou O Lord hast
                given
                unto me.</hi> Then for the tendry of the Tithe of the
                third year, which only was
                payable to the Priest, (those of the other two
                years
                being
                due to the <hi>Levites</hi>
                in the Countrey)
                it was
                to be brought
                unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                and tendred
                in these following
                words,
                <hi>viz. I have brought
                away the hallowed
                thing out of mine House, and also have
                given
                them
                unto the</hi> Levite, <hi>and unto the Stranger, to the
                Fatherless, and to the Widow, according
                to all thy Commandments
                which thou hast
                commanded
                me: I have not transgressed
                thy Commandments,
                neither have I forgotten
                them.
                I have not eaten
                thereof in my journeying,
                neither have I taken
                away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor
                given
                ought thereof for the dead; but I have
                bearkened
                to the voice of the Lord my God, and have
                done
                according
                to all that thou hast
                commanded
                me. Look down from thy holy habitation from Heaven, and
                bless thy people</hi> Israel, <hi>and the Land which thou
                hast
                given
                us; as thou swarest
                to our Fathers,
                a Land that floweth
                with Milk and Honey.</hi> Of this see <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.

                for with such care and diligence that a
                Mousehole
                was
                not left unransacked, they threw it in the fire, with this
                solemn form of execration,
                <hi>viz. Let all that Leaven,
                or whatsoever leavened
                thing is
                in my power, whether it were
                seen
                of me, or not seen,
                whether cleansed
                by me, or not cleansed,
                let all that be scattered,
                destroyed,
                and accounted
                of as the dust of the Earth:</hi> A
                prescribed
                form they also had,
                in a constant practice for the confession of their
                sins,
                to the Throne of God. The ground thereof they
                took
                indeed from the holy Scripture, where the Lord God
                commanded,
                saying,
                <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>shall lay both his
                hands
                upon the head of the live Goat, and confess over
                him
                all the Iniquities
                of the Children
                of</hi> Israel, <hi>and all their
                Transgressions
                in all their sins,
                putting
                them
                upon the head of the Goat,</hi> c.
              
              Ask <hi>Lyra,</hi> what kind of
                Confession
                is
                there meant,
                and he will tell you that it was
                a general Confession of the peoples
                sins,
                made
                by the mouth of the Priest, for and in their
                names;
                <hi>sicut facimus in Confessione
                in principio Missae,</hi> as we (the
                Priests)
                are wont to make in the beginning
                of the Mass. The Learned
                <hi>Morney</hi> comes
                more home, and informs
                us thus.
              
              <hi>Confessio olim in sacrificio solennis. Ejus
                praeterquam in lege vestigia, in Prophetis formulam
                habemus. In ipsis</hi> Judaeorum <hi>libris verba tanquam
                concepta extant, quae</hi> sacerdos <hi>pronunciare
                solitus.</hi> Of old they had
                a solemn or set manner of Confession,
              
              whereof besides
                those footsteps
                of it which are remaining
                in the Law, the form is
                extant in the Prophets.
                And in the Jewish Liturgy the express
                words
                are to be seen,
                which were
                pronounced
                by the Priest. Now if we ask of <hi>Paulus Phagius,</hi>
                than whom
                none more acquainted
                with the Jewish Liturgies,
                what the precise form was
                which the Priest did
                use; he will thus inform
                us.
              <q>
                <hi>Forma confessionis qua tum usus est summus</hi>
                  Pontifex, <hi>secundum</hi> Hebraeorum <hi>relationem
                  haec fuit,</hi> c. The <hi>form</hi>
                  (saith
                  he) used
                  then by the High Priest in Confessing
                  the peoples
                  sins,
                  (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors
                  have recorded)
                  was
                  as followeth.
                
                <hi>O Lord thy People of the House of</hi> Israel
                  <hi>have sinned,
                  they have done
                  wickedly,
                  they have grievously
                  transgressed
                  before thee.
                  O Lord make Atonement now for the
                  Sins,
                  and for the Iniquities,
                  and for the Trespasses
                  that thy People, the House of</hi> Israel <hi>have
                  sinned,
                  and unrighteously
                  done,
                  and trespassed
                  before thee,
                  as it is
                  written
                  in the Law of</hi> Moses
                  <hi>thy Servant,
                  that in this day he shall make Atonement for you.</hi>
              </q>
              This for the people on the Scapegoat.
                And there were
                two other Confessions
                made
                by the Priest also, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
              
              
              
              testifie;
                one for himself,
              
              the other for himself with the other
                Priests;
                both on the Bullock of the Sin-offering,
                mentioned
                <hi>v.</hi> 6. each of which also
                had
                their certain and prescribed
                forms.
                For when he offered
                the Bullock for a Sin-offering
                for himself, he said,
                <hi>O Lord I have sinned
                and done
                wickedly,
                and have grievously
                transgressed.
                I beseech thee
                now, O Lord, be merciful unto those
                sins
                and iniquities,
                and grievous transgressions,
                wherein I
                have sinned,</hi>
              
              <hi>done
                wickedly,
                and transgressed
                against thee.</hi>
                And when he offered
                for himself,
                and the rest of the Priests,
                then he used
                these words,
                saying,
                <hi>I and my House, and the Sons
                of</hi> Aaron <hi>thy holy people have
                sinned
                and done
                wickedly,</hi>
                c. <hi>I beseech thee
                now, O Lord, be merciful,</hi> c. as in the other
                forms
                before delivered.
                Finally,
                as there was
                a form prescribed
                the Priests,
                in which to make Confession of their own and the
                peoples
                sins
                to the Lord their God; so if the people
                were
                Impenitent, and neither would be
                brought
                unto repentance, or amendment of life, they
                had
                their forms
                of Excommunication also. Witness the solemn form in use
                amongst them
                in Excommunicating
                the <hi>Samaritans.</hi>
                In the denouncing
                of which censure, they brought
                together 300 Priests,
                and 300 Trumpets,
                and 300 Books
                of the Law, and 300 Boys,
                and they blew
                with the Trumpets;
                and the <hi>Levites</hi>
                singing,
                accursed
                the <hi>Cuttbaeans</hi> (or <hi>Samaritans</hi>)
                in the name of <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> or
                <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> and with the curses
                both of the higher
                and lower House of judicature, and
                said,
                <hi>Cursed
                is
                he who eats
                the bread of the</hi> Cutthaean; <hi>and let no</hi>
                Cutthaean <hi>be a Proselyte in</hi> Israel,
              
              <hi>neither have any part in the resurrection of the
                just.</hi> Which Curse being
                wrote
                on Tables,
                and sealed
                up, was
                published
                over all the Coasts
                of <hi>Israel,</hi> who multiplied
                this great <hi>Anathema</hi> or Curse upon
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing can be more plain than this,
              
              that in almost all sacred and religious
                duties,
                which were
                to be performed
                in publick,
                the Jews
                had
                anciently
                their appointed
                and determinate forms;
                as well as their appointed
                and determinate either times
                or places.
                But against this it is
                objected
                out of <hi>Rabbi Maimony,</hi> that from the time of
                <hi>Moses</hi>
                unto <hi>Ezra, there was
                no stinted
                form of Prayer heard
                of in the Jewish Church, but every man
                prayed
                according
                unto his ability.</hi>
              
              To which the Answer is
                in brief, that they who have produced
                this place out of <hi>Rabbi Maimony,</hi> dare not stand
                upon it, conceiving
                it to be no <hi>testimony to command belief:</hi>
                Secondly,
                that the <hi>Rabbi</hi> in the place
                alledged,
                speaks
                not of publick,
                but of private prayers:
                And thirdly,
                that the place is
                curtalled to make it serve the turn the better. For look
                upon the place at large, and we find it thus. <hi>We are
                commanded
                to pray every day, as it is
                written,</hi>
                And ye shall serve the Lord your God, Exod. xxiii. 25.
                <hi>We have been
                taught
                that this Service is
                Prayer, as it is
                written,</hi>
                And to serve him
                with all your heart. <hi>Our wise
                men
                have said,
                what Service is
                this with the heart? It is
                Prayer. And there is
                no number of Prayers
                by the Law, neither is
                there any set form of this Prayer by the Law, nor any
                appointed
                time for prayer by the Law. And therefore
                Women
                and Servants
                are bound
                to pray, because it is
                a Commandment, the time whereof
                is
                not determined.
                But the duty of this Commandment
                is
                thus, that a Man make Supplication and Prayer every day,
                and shew
                forth the praise of the holy blessed
                God, and afterward
                ask such things
                as be needful for him
                by request, and by supplication; and afterward give praise
                and thanks
                unto the Lord for his goodness, which he
                abundantly
                ministreth
                unto him;
                every one according
                to his might. If he be accustomed
                unto it, let him
                use such Supplication
                and Prayer; and if he be of uncircumcised
                lips,
                let him
                speak according
                as he is
                able, at any time when he will; and so they make
                Prayers
                every one according
                unto his ability.</hi> This is
                the place at large in <hi>Rabbi Maimony.</hi>
              
              And who sees
                not, that this must be interpreted
                of private prayer, or else it will conclude as
                strongly
                against appointed
                times
                and places
                for the performance of this holy exercise, as against the
                forms;
                and then what will become of the
                blessed
                <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the day of Prayer; or of the holy
                Temple, the House of Prayer? Must not they also be
                discharged
                on the self-same grounds?
                Or were
                it meant
                of publick
                Prayer (as it cannot be) all that can be
                inferred,
                is
                no more than this, that God prescribed
                no set form or number of prayers
                in the Book of the Law; which makes
                but little to the purpose. For it
                was
                said
                and shewed
                before, that <hi>Moses</hi>
                was
                more punctual and precise in laying
                down the form and matter of the legal
                Sacrifices,
                by which the <hi>Jews</hi>
                were
                to be nourished
                in the faith of Christ, and with the which they
                had
                not been
                acquainted
                in the former times;
                than in prescribing
                forms
                of Prayer and Praises,
                being
                moral duties,
                in which they had
                been
                trained
                from their very
                infancy. Now to this argument derived
                from the Authority of the <hi>Jewish
                Rabbins,</hi>
                we must needs
                add another which is
                made
                against them;
                and that is,
                <hi>that the evidence
                of all this</hi> (as also of much of that which
                followeth)
                <hi>comes
                from no better Author than</hi> Maimonides,
              
              <hi>who wrote
                not till above a thousand years
                after Christ.</hi> Against which weak objection (for it
                is
                no other) we have a very strong respondent, even the
                famous
              
              
              <hi>Scaliger.</hi> Who having
                made
                a full description of those rites
                and forms
                wherewith
                the Passeover
                was
                solemnized
                in the former times,
                collected
                from the Writings
                of the <hi>Jewish Rabbins,</hi>
                thinks
                it as idle and ridiculous to except against
                them,
                because observed
                by Writers
                of a later
                date, though from the best Records
                and Monuments
                of that scattered
                Nation; as if a man reading
                the <hi>Pandects</hi>
                of the Civil Law, composed
                in <hi>Justinians</hi>
                time, should make a question whether those
                judgments
                and opinions
                ascribed
                unto <hi>Paepinian, Paulus, Ulpianus,</hi>
                were
                theirs or not. <hi>Quod nemo sanus dixerit,</hi>
              
              <hi>Quod nemo sanus dixerit,</hi> which none,
                saith
                he, except a mad-man, would make question of. And so these
                rubs
                being
                thus removed,
                and in part anticipated,
                we will go forwards
                with our search in the Name of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              But first, before we end this Chapter,
              
              considering
                that there were
                set forms
                of Marriages,
                and set rites
                of Burial, and those of great Antiquity in the Jewish
                Church; I will here put them
                down in the way of Corollary. For though they
                were
                no part of the publick
                worship, yet doubtless they were
                parts
                of the publick
                Liturgy; and being
                performed
                with Prayer and Invocation of Gods
                holy Name, they deserve place here. And first for
                Marriage, in the solemnities
                thereof they observed
                this form: The time appointed
                being
                come, the Bride and Bridegroom were
                conducted
                by their special Friends,
                who are styled
                , <hi>Children
                of the Bride-Chamber,</hi>
              
              in S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, to the Marriage-house;
                which from the Blessings
                and Thanksgivings
                which were
                used
                therein on these occasions,
                was
                called
                <hi>Beth Hillula,</hi> the House of Praise. There, in
                an
                Assembly
                of ten men
                at the least, the Writing,
                or <hi>Bill of Dowry</hi> being
                ratied before
                a <hi>Scrivener</hi> or <hi>publick
                Notary,</hi> the Man thus said
                unto the Woman: <hi>Esto mihi in uxorem secundum
                legem</hi> Mosis  Israel, <hi> Ego juxta verbum
                Dei colam te, honorabo te,</hi>
              
              <hi>alam  regam juxta morem qui colunt, honorant,
                 regunt uxores fideliter. Do
                autem
                tibi dotem virginitatis tuae ducentos aureos</hi> (i.e. 50
                <hi>siclos</hi>) <hi>quin etiam alimentum tuum 
                vestitum,
                atque sufficientem necessitatem tuam,</hi>
              
              <hi>item cognitionem tui juxta consuetudinem universae
                terrae.</hi> That is
                to say,
              <q>Be thou a Wife to me according
                to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
                and <hi>Israel,</hi> and I shall worship and honour
                thee
                according
                to the Word of God: I shall seed and govern
                thee
                according
                to the custom of those who worship, honour, and
                govern their
                Wives
                faithfully.
                I give thee
                for the Dowry of thy Virginity, two
                hundred
                pence, (<hi>i. e.</hi> 50 <hi>Shekels</hi>)
                as also thy food, cloathing,
                and all sufficient necessaries,
                and knowledge of thee
                according
                to the custom of the whole earth.</q>
              
              Much of which form, as to the main and substance of it,
                is
                exceeding
                Ancient. For in the Marriage of <hi>Sampson</hi> we find
                the <hi>Children
                of the Bride-Chamber,</hi> being
                the thirty young men,
                his Companions
                as they are there called;
                in that of <hi>David</hi> unto <hi>Michael,</hi> the
                Daughter of <hi>Saul,</hi> the bringing
                in of an
                hundred Foreskins
                of the Philistins,
                <hi>in loco dotis,</hi> as the Dowry-money; in that of
                <hi>Ruth,</hi> the presence of ten
                men
                to bear witness to it. Nor was
                this done,
                being
                a business of such moment, without a special
                <hi>Benediction.</hi> For at the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi>
                to <hi>Ruth,</hi> the <hi>People and the
                Elders
                said,
                The Lord make the Woman which is
                come into thine House, like</hi> Rachel, <hi>and like</hi>
                Leah, <hi>which two did
                build the House of</hi> Israel; <hi>and do thou
                worthily
                in</hi> Ephrata, <hi>and be famous in</hi> Bethlehem;
                <hi>and let thy House be like the House of</hi> Pharez,
                <hi>of the Seed which the Lord will give
                thee
                of this young Woman.</hi>
              
              Upon this ground it was
                that Marriage was
                not solemnized
                amonst
                them
                without Prayers
                and Blessings;
                the form whereof in the ensuing
                times
                was
                this as followeth,
                <hi>Benedictus sis Domine Deus noster, Rex universi,</hi>
                c.
              <q>
                Blessed
                  be the Lord our God, the King of the World, who
                  hath
                  Created
                  Man after his own Image, according
                  to the Image of his own likeness, and
                  hath
                  thereby prepared
                  unto himself an
                  everlasting building. Blessed
                  be thou O Lord God, who hast
                  Created
                  him.
                
                Then followeth
                  again, Blessed
                  be thou O Lord our God, who hast
                  Created
                  joy and gladness,
                  the Bridegroom and the Bride, Charity and Brotherly
                  love, Rejoycing
                  and Pleasure, Peace and Society. I beseech
                  thee
                  O Lord, let there be suddenly
                  heard
                  in the Cities
                  of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Streets
                  of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the
                  Bridegroom and the Bride; the voice of exaltation in the
                  Bride-Chamber is
                  sweeter
                  than any Feast, and Children
                  sweeter
                  than the sweetness of a song.
              </q>
              Which Prayer thus ended,
                one of the Bride-men
                or Companions
                took
                a cup (having
                before been
                blessed
                in the wonted
                form) and drinks
                unto the Married-couple.
                As for the form and rites
                of Burial, not to say any thing either of the
                washing
                or embalming
                of the Corps,
                which was
                common unto them
                with other Nations,
              
              their custom was,
                after the body was
                interred,
                to speak something of the justice of God, and of
                mans
                sin which meriteth
                death; and they prayed
                God in justice to remember mercy. This
                said,
                they gave
                a Cup of Consolation to the sad-hearted.
                Finally,
                on the grave
              
              
              
              or Tombstone, they caused
                these words
                ensuing
                to be written,
                <hi>Sit anima ejus in fasciculo
                vitae cum caeteris justis.</hi> Amen, Amen,
                <hi>Selah.</hi> That is
                to say, let his soul be in the bundle of life with the
                rest of the just. <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> So be it. These as
                they were
                the ancient forms
                and ceremonies
                used
                in their Marriages
                and Burials;
                so after, when they had
                erected
                Synagogues
                in convenient places,
                they solemnized
                their Marriages
                in a Tent,
              
              set upon four Pillars
                near their Synagogue; which shews,
                that there was
                something
                in it wherewith the Priest or Prophet
                was
                to intermeddle, and that they did
                esteem it of a nature not so meerly
                civil, but that the blessing
                of the Minister was
                required
                unto it. But it is
                time I now go forward to the Ages
                following.

              THE Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                being
                thus setled
                into an
                established
                Church by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                and several forms
                of Prayer and Praise and Benediction
                prescribed
                unto
                them,
                either immediately
                by the Lord himself, or by the Church
                directed
                by the wisdom of Almighty God; it
                was
                not long before that divers
                other points
                were
                added
                by the like Authority, until the Liturgy thereof
                became
                full and absolute. Of these the first in course of time,
                was
                the deputing
                of certain and determinate hours
                in every day, for the performance of those moral
                duties
                of Prayer and Praises,
                in which Gods
                publick
                worship did
                consist especially;
                which were
                the third, the sixth, and the ninth.
                For clearer
                knowledge of the which we shall add thus much, that the
                <hi>Jews</hi>
                did
                usually
                divide their
                day into four great parts
                (<hi>hours
                of the Temple</hi> they were
                called)
                that is
                to say, the third hour, which began
                at six of the Clock in the Morning, and
                held
                on till nine; the sixth, which began
                at nine and ended
                at twelve; the ninth,
                which held
                from twelve to three in the afternoon; and the eleventh,
                which was
                from three until six at night. According
                to which distribution, they had
                three several hours
                of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> the third, the sixth, the
                ninth,
                as before was
                said.
                For thus saith
                <hi>David</hi> of himself, <hi>Evening and Morning, and at
                Noon-day will I pray unto thee,</hi>
                Psal. lv. 17. And so the Scriptures
                say of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>turning
                towards</hi>
                Hierusalem,
                <hi>he kneeled
                upon his knees
                and prayed,
                and gave
                thanks
                before his God three times
                a day,</hi> as he had
                formerly
                been
                accustomed,
                <hi>Dan.</hi> vi. 10. <hi>David</hi> who
                had
                the opportunity to repair unto the
                Tabernacle,
                or the House of God, joyned
                with the Congregation in those Prayers
                which were
                appointed
                for those times.
                But <hi>Daniel</hi> who lived
                an
                exile in a strange Land, and
              
              
              at a time, in which there was
                no Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                only conceived
                himself obliged
                to observe the hours
                which had
                been
                antiently
                in Use with the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation; without
                being
                punctual in the forms,
                for ought I can find. It's true, the
                <hi>Jews</hi>
                used
                to repair unto the Tabernacle, as
                afterwards
                unto the Temple, and other places
                set apart for
                this pious duty (of which more anon) to offer up their
                private Prayers
                and Vowes
                to Almighty God. For so we read of <hi>Hannah</hi> in the
                first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 1. v. 10. <hi>c.</hi>
                and so in other places
                of Gods
                Book of divers
                others. Of which none is
                more eminent, because not any one so much
                objected
                as that of the <hi>Publican</hi> and the
                <hi>Pharisee,</hi> of whom
                we find mention in the Gospel, who
                going
                into the Temple to pray, (as who else
                did
                not?) are confidently
                said
                to use no prayer that was
                of regular prescription, because the prayer which they are
                said
                to make in the Book of God,
              
              was
                of a present conception. But this, if
                pondered
                as it ought, can be no Argument I trow, that therefore
                there was
                then no set form of publick
                worship to be performed
                in those holy places,
                because Gods
                Servants
                used
                as occasion was,
                to make therein their private Prayers
                to the Lord their God: No better argument, than if it
                should be proved
                that there is
                no set Liturgy in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because
                devout and godly men
                use oftentimes
                to have recourse unto the Church (or Temple) for their
                private prayers.
                In those, though poured
                forth in the Temple, the proper and
                appointed
                place of publick
                worship, the people were
                at liberty to make Use of their own
                conceptions.
                But it was
                otherwise in those acts
                of worship, (so far forth as they do relate unto
                Invocation) which were
                to be performed
                with the Congregation. And so it
                is
                resolved
                by the best and learnedest
                of all the <hi>Rabbins;</hi>
                by whom
                it is
                affirmed,
                that in the publick
                Congregation, a private or a voluntary prayer
                was
                not to have been
                offered
                to the Lord their God: <hi>Quoniam nec Ecclesia seu caetus
                publicus offerebat ex lege sacrificium ultroneum;</hi>
                because the Church or Congregation
                was
                not to offer any Sacrifice but such as
                was
                prescribed
                and ordered
                by the Law of God.
              
              Which rule as it was
                constantly
                observed
                in all other days,
                and at the several hours
                of prayer in each several day; so most
                especially
                upon the <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
                and the other Festivals;
                and that upon the self-same reason, <hi>viz. Quoniam in
                eis non offerendum erat ultroneum quid,</hi> because no
                voluntary oblation
                might thereon be offered,
                (as in some cases
                might be done
                on the other days)
                but only such as were
                appointed
                in the Law. Now that there were
                set forms
                of prayer for these several hours
                (besides
                what is
                affirmed
                by a Learned
                Writer of our own) as appeareth
                by that memorable passage of <hi>Peter</hi> and
                <hi>John</hi>'s going
                up into the Temple,
              
              <hi>sub horam orationis nonam,</hi> at the
                ninth
                hour, being
                an
                hour of prayer. For if the prayer they
                went
                to make, were
                rather of a sudden and extemporary Conception,
              
              than of a regular Prescription, what
                needed
                they to have made
                Use of such a time, when as the Congregation
                was
                assembled
                for Gods
                publick
                worship? And on the other side, that the prayer which the
                two Apostles
                went
                up to make, was
                such as was
                prescribed
                the Congregation, is
                evident by that of <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> the
                <hi>French</hi> Oracle of <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                Learning,
                as one truly
                calls
                him,
                who saith
                expresly,
              
              <hi>Orationem eam cujus causa</hi> Petrus <hi>petebant templum, fuisse eam, quae
                </hi> Judaeis <hi>dicitur 
                Quae respondet oblationi vespertinae lege
                praescriptae.</hi> The prayer (saith
                he) for which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
                went
                up into the Temple, is
                that which the <hi>Jews</hi>
                called
                the lesser oblation, answering
                to the evening Sacrifice prescribed
                by the Law. And indeed <hi>Calvin</hi>
                intimates
                no less, to my apprehension. For when he
                askes
                the question, <hi>An
                Apostoli in Templum ascenderint, ut secundum legis ritum
                precarentur,</hi> whether the Apostles
                went
                into the Temple to pray, according
                to the rites
                prescribed
                in the Law;
              
              although he thinks
                that they went
                thither at that time to have the better opportunity to
                promote the Gospel; yet he confesseth
                by the question, that at that time there
                were
                set prayers
                made
                in the Temple, after the manner of the
                Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to go on from <hi>Moses</hi>
                unto <hi>David,</hi> I find but little
                changed
                or added
                in things
                that did
                concern Gods
                publick
                worship, and the forms
                thereof. But in the time of <hi>David,</hi> and by his
                Authority, there was
                a signal alteration made;
                much outward form and lustre added
                to the service of God. For whereas
                formerly
                the <hi>Levites</hi>
                were
                appointed
                by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                to bear about the Tabernacle, as occasion
                was;
                the Tabernacle
                being
                by <hi>David</hi> fixt
                and setled
                in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                there was
                no further Use of the attendance of the
                <hi>Levites</hi>
                in that kind or ministery.
                He therefore thought it fit to set
                them
                to some new imployment;
                some to assist the Priests
                in the publick
                offices
                of Gods
                holy worship; some to be over-seers
                and Judges
                of the people, some to be Porters
                also in the House of God; and others
                finally
                to be Singers,
                <hi>to praise the Lord with Instruments
                that he had
                made,
                with Harps,
                with Viols,
                and with Cymbals.</hi>
              
              Of these the
              
              
              
              most considerable were
                the first and last, the first appointed
                to assist at the <hi>Daily Sacrifices,
                as also at the offering
                of all Burnt-offerings
                unto the Lord, in the Sabbaths,
                the moneths,
                and at the appointed
                times,
                according
                to the number, and according
                to their custom, continually
                before the Lord.</hi>
              
              The other were
                instructed
                in <hi>the Songs
                of the Lord,</hi> not only such as
                had
                been
                made
                before in the former times,
                but such as he composed
                himself, according
                to the influence of the holy Spirit. <hi>Josephus</hi>
                tells
                us in the general, that after <hi>Absaloms</hi>
                rebelling
                was
                suppressed,
              
              and the Kingdom setled,
                , he composed
                <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi>
                to the praise of God; as also that he
                made
                divers
                kinds
                of Instruments,
                and that he taught
                the <hi>Levites</hi>
                to praise Gods
                Name upon the same, both on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                , and on other the
                appointed
                Festivals.
                And this we may observe also in the holy Scripture by the
                style and title of those Psalms
                which were
                then made
                by him
                for that end and purpose. For if we look upon the xcii.
                <hi>Psalm,</hi> we find it styled,
                <hi>A Song or Psalm for the Sabbath day,</hi> i. e. as it
                is
                generally
                expounded,
                a Song made
                to be sung
                on the Sabbath day. <hi>Docet inscriptio Sabbatis
                praecipu cantatum fuisse hunc Psalmum,</hi>
              
              saith
                <hi>Mart. Bucer:</hi> Which <hi>Calvin</hi>
                seconds
                and approves.
                To the same purpose also <hi>Lyra,</hi> save that he
                makes
                the Author of it to be <hi>Moses,</hi>
              
              following
                therein the old tradition of the <hi>Hebrew, Secundum
                Hebraeos Moyses
                feeit hunc Psalmum decantandum in die Sabbati;</hi> as he
                notes
                it there. Of the same nature are those
                <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                which in S. <hi>Hieroms</hi>
                Bible and the Vulgar <hi>Latine,</hi>
                are entituled
                <hi>Laus cantici Davidis
                in die ante Sabbatum,  Psalmus David quarta
                Sabbati;</hi> being
                the 93  94, of our <hi>English</hi>
                Bibles.
                Which what else were
                they but some <hi>Psalms</hi>
                by him
                intended
                to be sung
                in the Congregation upon the <hi>Wednesday</hi> and the
                <hi>Friday?</hi> Besides
                it is
                observed
                by <hi>Junius,</hi> that from the
                times
                of <hi>David</hi> forwards,
                they sung
                the 22 <hi>Psalm, ante alias omnes actiones sacras,</hi>
                before they did
                begin the Morning Sacrifice; and that they
                sung
                each day (as they did
                the former) and 136 <hi>Psalm</hi> at the conclusion of
                the Evening Service. For which consult
                him
                in his Notes
                on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxix. As for the fifteen
                Psalms
                called
                in the holy Scriptures,
                <hi>Cantica graduum,</hi> Psalms
                or Songs
                of degrees,
                being
                the 120 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and the fourteen
                following,
                according
                to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Calculation, and the
                <hi>English</hi> Bibles;
                they are conceived
                to be made
                for a perpetual and constant part of
                Gods
                daily Service. For though I find amongst
                Interpreters
                no little difference about the reason of these
                titles;
                yet that to me seems
                most agreeable to the truth thereof, which
                is
                most generall
                agreed,
                both by the <hi>Latine</hi>
                Writers
                and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> DOctors.
                And amongst them
                <hi>secundum Doctores Hebraeos  Latinos,</hi> it
                is
                resolved,
                saith
                <hi>Lyra,</hi> that they were
                so called,
                <hi>eo quod in ascensu</hi> Templi <hi>qui erat per
                quindecim gradus, cantabantur </hi> Sacerdotibus
                <hi> Levitis, primus Psalmus in primo gradu, secundus
                in secundo  sic de aliis;</hi>
              
              because they were
                sung
                by the <hi>Priests</hi>
                and <hi>Levites</hi>
                upon the fifteen Stairs
                or degrees
                that went
                up to the Temple. And this of <hi>Lyra,</hi>
                is
                favoured
                by the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> as
                is
                said
                by <hi>Aynsworth</hi> in his short
                notes
                upon the <hi>Psalms.</hi>
                And here that divers
                of the <hi>Psalms</hi>
                are such as seem to b e composed
                of purpose for stirring
                up the affections
                of the Congregation, as <hi>viz.</hi> Psal. xxxiv. <hi>O
                magnifie
                the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together.</hi>
                And <hi>Psal.</hi> xcv. Venite Adoremus, <hi>O come, let
                us worship and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our
                Maker.</hi> And Psal. cxlix. <hi>O sing unto the Lord a
                new song, and his praise in the Congregation of the
                Saints,</hi>
                with many others of that stamp; and then I doubt not but
                it will appear to any apprehensive Reader, that those and
                divers
                of the rest were
                made
                of purpose to be sung
                daily in the Celebrating
                of Gods
                publick
                Service, and so by consequence to be a principal and
                constant part of the publick
                Liturgy. And it was
                usual with the <hi>Jews,</hi>
              
              when they carried
                their first fruits
                to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                to sing upon the way the 122 <hi>Psalm;</hi> when they
                came
                into the Sanctuary, with every mans
                Basket on his shoulder, to sing the last in all the book;
                and when they were
                in the Court-yard to sing the 30. So that it
                seems
                they had
                set <hi>Psalms</hi>
                for every duty, which was
                to be discharged
                in publick;
                and more than so, set parts
                and parcels
                of some <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                for the beginning
                and conclusion of all publick
                offices.
                For, for the Introduction
                to their Prayers
                they used
                always
                this, <hi>O Lord open our lips,
                and our mouth shall shew
                forth thy praise,</hi> Psal. li. 15. and for the close
                thereof, this clause, <hi>Let the
                words
                of my mouth, and the meditations
                of my heart be always
                acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength and my
                Redeemer,</hi>
              
              Psal. xix. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now unto these collections
                from the holy Scripture, it will not be amiss to add from
                the <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi>
                the form and manner in which Gods
                publick
                Service was
                performed,
                after the setling
                and establishing
                of the same by <hi>David.</hi>
              
              <hi>The</hi> Priests
                <hi>and</hi> Levites,
                <hi>say the</hi> Rabbins,
                <hi>do sing the song over all the
                Burnt-offerings
                of the Congregation, which they
                were
                bound
                to offer, and over all the Peace-offerings
                of the solemn Assembly,
                at the time when
              
              
              the wine</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Drink-offering</hi>)
                <hi>was
                poured
                out. But over the voluntary Burnt-offerings
                which the Congregation offered,
                and the drink-offerings
                which were
                brought
                for them,
                they said
                not the song. A</hi> Levite <hi>that
                mourned
                might not serve nor sing; and there might not be
                fewer
                than twelve</hi> Levites
                <hi>standing
                on the bank or stage everyday, to say the song over the
                Sacrifice;
                but they might always
                have as many as they would. And they
                said
                not the song but by mouth without Instrument; for the
                foundation of the Musick
                is,
                that it be a Service by mouth. And there
                were
                others standing
                there playing
                with Instruments
                of Musick;
                and they played
                on Pipes
                and Psalteries,
                and Harps,
                and Trumpets,
                and Cymbals.
                There might not be fewer
                than two Psalteries,
                nor more than six; nor fewer
                than two Pipes
                (or Flutes)
                nor more than twelve; nor fewer
                than two Trumpets,
                or more than an
                hundred and twenty; nor fewer
                than nine Harps,
                but as many as they would; and one Cymbal only. In all the
                days
                of the solemn Feasts,
                and at the new Maons, there were
                Priests
                blowing
                with Trumpets
                at the hour of the Sacrifice,</hi> Numb. x. 10. <hi>and
                the</hi> Levites
                <hi>said
                the song. The Trumpets
                were
                of silver, and it was
                not lawful to have them
                of other metal. The Pipes
                which they played
                on were
                of Cane, or Reed; the Psaltery was
                an
                Instrument like a Bottle, and they
                played
                thereon. Twelve days
                in the year they played
                on the Pipe or Flute before the Altar,</hi> viz. <hi>at
                the killing
                of the first Passeover,
                and at the killing
                of the second Passeover,
                and in the first good day of the
                Passeover,
                and in the first good day of Pentecost, and in the eight
                days
                of the Feast of Tabernacles.</hi>
                No Service
                almost celebrated
                without Songs
                or Musick,
                and that ordained
                after the Law Levitical
                was
                given
                to <hi>Moses,</hi>
                and all the Rites
                and ceremonies
                of the same prescribed
                and limited;
                which plainly
                shews
                that Instrumental Musick
                in the celebrating
                of Gods
                publick
                worship, is
                not derived
                at any hand from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                or to be reckoned
                as a part of the Rites
                and Ceremonies
                of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices.
                And lest this intermixture
                of Songs
                and Musick
                in the officiating
                of the Moral worship of God, might either be
                conceived
                to have been
                introduced
                by the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                in the declining
                times
                of their zeal and piety; or else
                ordained
                by <hi>David</hi> without good Authority, and never
                practised
                in the purer
                times
                of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church; we will look into the
                Acts
                of <hi>Solomon, Hezekiah, Ezra.</hi> Of <hi>Solomon</hi>
                and <hi>Ezra</hi> more anon. Of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> this at
                present; of whom
                it is
                recorded
                in the Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
                that in the restauration of Gods
                worship, being
                much corrupted,
                <hi>When the Burnt-offering
                began,
                the Song of the Lord began
                also with Trumpets,
                and with the Instruments
                ordained
                by</hi> David <hi>king of</hi> Israel: <hi>And all the
                Congregation
                worshipped,
                and the Singers
                sang,
                and the Trumpeters
                sounded,</hi>
              
              <hi>and all this continued
                till the Burnt-offering
                was
                finished.</hi>
                Where note, that this was
                some appointed
                and determinate
                song which had
                been
                formerly
                set out for the like occasions,
                that which is
                here entituled
                the Song of the Lord, or <hi>canticum Traditum,</hi> as
                the word is
                rendred
                by <hi>Tremelius;</hi>
                as also that the intermixture of Musical
                Instruments
                in Gods
                holy Service is
                referred
                to <hi>David.</hi> And so 'tis also in the Book of
                <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
              
              where both the Singers
                and the songs
                are referred
                to him.
                <hi>For in the days
                of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Asaph <hi>of old, there
                were
                chief of the Singers,
                and songs
                of praise and thanksgiving unto God,</hi>
                saith
                the holy Scripture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> next, the
                greatest
                and most memorable action of whose
                times,
              
              was
                the building of the first and second
                Temples,
                <hi>immensae opulentiae Templum,</hi>
              
              as the last is
                called
                by the Historian. For that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as soon as
                it was
                fitted
                and prepared
                for the Service of God, that godly and religious Prince,
                to whom
                the Lord had
                given
                a large and understanding
                heart, as the Scripture tells
                us, did
                not think fit to put it unto publick
                Use, till he had
                dedicated
                the same to the Lord his God, by Prayer and Sacrifice. The
                pomp and order of the Dedication we may see at large, 1
                <hi>King.</hi> viii. To which add this considerable
                passage from the Book of <hi>Chronicles;</hi>
                where it is
                said,
              
              with reverence unto <hi>Davids</hi>
                Institution, that the <hi>Levites</hi>
                which were
                the Singers,
                all of them
                of <hi>Asaph,</hi> of <hi>Heman,</hi> of
                <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> with their Sons
                and their Brethren; being
                <hi>arayed
                in white linen, having
                Cymbals
                and Psalteries,
                and Harps,
                stood
                at the East end of the Altar, and with
                them
                an
                hundred and twenty Priests
                sounding
                with Trumpets:
                And that it came
                to pass, as the Trumpeters
                and Singers
                were
                as one, to make one sound to be
                heard
                in praising
                and thanking
                the Lord, that they lift vp
                their voice with the Trumpets
                and Cymbals
                and Instruments
                of Musick,
                and praised
                the Lord, saying,
                For he is
                good, for his mercy endureth
                for ever.</hi> In which we may observe two
                things,
                first, that in Celebrating
                Gods
                publick
                worship, and in that part thereof which
                was
                meerly
                moral, the <hi>Levites</hi>
                were
                <hi>arayed
                in a white linnen
                Rayment,</hi>
                such as the Surplice now in Use in the Church of
                <hi>England.</hi> And secondly,
                that they were
                prescribed
                what song or <hi>Psalm</hi> they
                were
                to sing, being
                the 136. of <hi>Davids
                Psalms,</hi>
                beginning
                with <hi>Confitemini Domino quoniam bonus, quoniam in
                aeternum misericordia ejus.</hi> And this we may the
                rather think to be a certain and
                prescribed
                Hymn, not taken
                up at the discretion of the <hi>Priests</hi>
                and <hi>Levites;</hi>
                because we
              
              
              
              find the same expresly
                in laying
                the foundation of the second Temple. For we are
                told
                in the book of <hi>Ezra,</hi>
              
              that <hi>when the Builders</hi>
                laid
                the foundation of the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Lord,
                <hi>they set the</hi> Priests
                <hi>in their Apparel with Trumpets,
                and the</hi> Levites
                <hi>the Sons
                of</hi> Asaph, <hi>with Cymbals,
                to praise the Lord, after the Ordinance of</hi> David
                <hi>the King of</hi> Israel: (where not that still this
                Institution is
                referred
                to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>And they
                sung
                together by course</hi> (Quire-wise) <hi>in
                praising
                and giving
                thanks
                unto the Lord, because he is
                good, for his mercy endureth
                for ever toward</hi> Israel. <hi>Lyra</hi>
                observes
                upon the place, that the <hi>Psalm</hi> here
                sung,
                <hi>ab ipso Davide factum,  ad hoc ordinatum,</hi>
                was
                made
                by <hi>David</hi> for this very purpose;
              
              who had
                not only left command to <hi>Solomon</hi> about the
                building of the Temple,
                but gave
                him
                patterns
                of the work, and much of the materials
                for the same. Add finally,
                that at the Dedication of each Temple, there
                was
                a great and sumptuous Feast provided
                for the People of God; whereof see 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii.
                65. and <hi>Ezra.</hi> vi. 16. Which as it
                was
                the ground of the , or <hi>Feast of
                Dedication,</hi> established
                after by the <hi>Maccabees;</hi>
                so gave
                it no small hint unto the Christians
                to institute the like Feasts
                on the like occasions;
                whereof more hereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mean time,
              
              to look a little back on <hi>Solomon,</hi> if question
                should be made
                to what particular end he did
                erect that magnificent Structure; I answer, that it
                was
                most specially
                for an
                House of Prayer. The legal Sacrifices
                were
                all of them
                performed
                in the outward Courts,
                and there were
                all the utensils
                and vessels
                which did
                pertain unto the same. The Priest that
                offered
                Sacrifice came
                not thither; he had
                no place nor portion
                in it. 'Tis true, there was
                an
                Altar in it, but 'twas the Altar of Incense, not the Altar
                for Sacrifices.
                That stood
                indeed within the Temple, as at the first, by
                Gods
                own Ordinance and appointment, within the Tabernacle,
                where it was
                placed
                before the Veil.
              
              And it was
                placed
                there to this end and purpose, that <hi>Aaron</hi> might
                <hi>burn Incense on it every morning when he
                dressed
                the lamps,
                and when he lighted
                them
                at even.</hi> By this was
                figured
                the offering
                up of the Prayers
                of the Saints
                to the Lord their God. We find it so
                expresly
                in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
              
              <hi>And another Angel,</hi> saith
                the Text, <hi>came
                and stood
                at the</hi> Altar, <hi>having
                a golden Censer, and there was
                given
                unto him
                much Incense, that he should offer
                is
                with the Prayers
                of all Saints
                upon the golden Altar that was
                before the Throne; and the smoak
                of the Incense which came
                with the Prayers
                of the Saints,
                ascended
                up before God out of the Angels
                hand.</hi> And hereto <hi>David</hi> doth allude in the
                book of <hi>Psalms.
                Let my prayer</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>be set forth before thee
                as Incense, and the lifting
                up of my hand as the Evening Sacrifice.</hi>
              
              But that which makes
                the matter most clear and evident,
                is
                the whole scope of <hi>Solomons</hi>
                prayer, made
                by him
                at the Dedication of it. The substance and effect whereof
                is
                no more than this, that in what misery or distress soever
                the people of
                the Lord should fall into, either by temporal plauges and
                punishments
                which assault without, or on the apprehension of their
                sins
                which assails
                within: If they poured
                forth their souls
                to God, either in or towards
                his holy Temple, the Lord would hear
                them
                and deliver them
                out of all their troubles.
                And so much is
                summed
                up by <hi>Josephus</hi> briefly,
              
              briefly,
                , c. <hi>If it shall so fall
                out</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>that thy People go astray, and that
                afterwards
                being
                punished
                by thee,
                with death, pestilence, or any such chastisement,
                wherewithal thou reclaimest
                those that offend against thee
                to the observance of thy Laws;
                if then they have recourse unto this Temple,
                beseeching
                and requiring
                thee
                of mercy, that thou wouldest
                please to hear them,
                and have mercy on them,
                and deliver them
                from their Adversities.</hi>
                Nor was
                it without
                special reason that God amongst so many
                Ministeries
                as were
                performed
                in and about his Temple, should single out the exercise of
                prayer; by which to give denomination
                to this holy place; for by that name, the House of Prayer,
                he hath
                been
                pleased
                to call it twice in one verse of
                <hi>Esay.</hi>
              
              Or that our Saviour Christ should be so
                scandalized
                at those which sold
                Doves
                in the verge thereof, or at the
                Tables
                of the Money-changers,
              
              being
                so necessary, or at least convenient for those who
                came
                from remote places,
                that they might easily
                provide their offerings
                there, and dispatch their business with the
                greater
                speed. Why else was
                this, but that our Saviour looked
                on it as a place for Sacrifice, wherein his legal worship
                was
                to be performed
                in the Oblations
                of Bulls
                and Goats,
                Turtles
                and Pidgeons,
                and the like; but as a place intended
                for his moral worship, wherein his People
                were
                to offer the calves
                of their lips;
                or at the least as on a place which
                was
                more grateful to him,
                as an
                House for Prayer, than as a Slaughter-house for Sacrifice?
                His saying
                that he would have <hi>mercy and not
                sacrifice,</hi>
                shews
                us how little he esteemed
                of the legal duties
                in respect of moral.
            </p>
            <p>
              So then,
              
              the Temple was
                an
                House of Prayer, and built
                most chiefly
                for the Use. Which being
                an
                action meerly
                moral, was
                notwithstanding to be waited
                on with such
              
              
              rites
                and gestures,
                wherewith the earnestness of their
                Petitions,
                and the humility of the Petitioners
                might be at once presented
                to the Lord their God. Not that these
                outward
                rites
                and gestures
                have in all times
                and places
                been
                the same alike; for I know well they have
                been,
                may be varied
                according
                unto times
                and seasons;
                the customs
                and conditions
                of several Nations;
                but that in many of them,
                and those the principal, there hath
                been
                an
                unanimous agreement over all the world. The first of those
                which we shall speak of in this place,
                is
                that which was
                first used
                in this holy Temple, which was
                the kneeling
                on the knee, and then the lifting
                up of the hands
                to God. For so we find it of K. <hi>Solomon</hi> at the
                first Consecration of it, and in the prayer of
                Consecration, that he <hi>kneeled
                on his knees
                before the Altar, and his hands
                spread up unto the Heavens.</hi>
              
              But behold a greater
                than <hi>Solomon</hi> is
                here; for Christ our Saviour, when he
                prayed
                to God that that <hi>Cup if it were
                possible might pass from him,</hi>
                , <hi>he fell upon his
                knees
                and prayed,</hi>
                as S. <hi>Luke;</hi> procidit super terram, <hi>He fell
                upon the ground and prayed,</hi>
              
              as S. <hi>Mark;</hi> procidit super faciem suam, <hi>He
                fell upon his face and prayed,</hi>
                as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath
                it. Our Saviour being
                both the Lord and the Son of <hi>David,</hi>
                was
                not to seek in <hi>David</hi>'s lesson, where he doth call
                upon the people, and invite them,
                saying,
                <hi>O come, let us worship and fall down, and kneel before
                the Lord our Maker.</hi> He which
                is
                all in all, did
                all this and more. I know it is
                conceived
                that commonly
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                did
                stand upon their feet
                in the act of Prayer; and for the proof thereof,
                is
                brought
                as well the instance of the <hi>Pharisee</hi> and the
                <hi>Publican,</hi> of both whom
                it is
                said
                that they <hi>stood
                and prayed;</hi>
                as also an
                old Saying
                used
                amongst that people, <hi>Sine stationibus non subsisteret
                mundus.</hi>
              
              But clearly
                this is
                to be understood
                of private Prayers,
                whether made
                in the Temple, as that of the <hi>Publican</hi> and the
                <hi>Pharisee</hi> before instanced
                in, or in the fields,
                the ways,
                a mans
                secret closet, which cannot but be much subservient unto
                the general subsistence of the Universe, in which they
                were
                at liberty to stand or kneel, and
                did
                stand most commonly:
                not of the <hi>publick
                acts
                of worship in the Congregation.
                Davids
                Venite, adoremus</hi>
                makes
                this sure enough. Yet we will make it somewhat
                surer
                if it may be possible, by adding
                to this Text of <hi>David,</hi> the Gloss or Commentary of
                the <hi>Jewish Rabbins;</hi>
                and they t ell us this, <hi>that in the place of</hi>
                David <hi>there are three several
                gestures
                of humiliation in the sight of God, and that they all
                differed
                from one another. The</hi> bending
                <hi>of the body spoken
                of in any place, is
                towards
                the knees,
                the bowing
                of all the joynts
                of the backbone,
                so that he makes
                his body as a bow; the bending
                of the head is
                with the face or countenance
                downward; the bowing
                of ones
                self, or worshipping,
                is
                the displaying
                of hands
                and feet,
                till he be prostrate with his face on the earth.</hi> And
                they conceived
                that every one of these had
                its
                several Use; it being
                noted
                by them,
                <hi>that the bending
                of the head with the face to the ground,
                was
                to escape judgement; the bowing
                of themselves or worshipping,
                to obtain mercy; and that the bending
                of the head was
                before the worshipping,
                according
                to the mystery of the Sin-offering
                before the Burnt-offering.</hi>
                This is
                observed
                by <hi>Maimony</hi> in his book of Prayer;
              
              and so most like to be the usual
                gestures
                in the Act of prayer. In those particulars
                of <hi>kneeling
                and spreading
                of the hands</hi>
                to Heaven, the <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                hold good correspondence
                with one another. In other rites
                concerning
                Prayer they extreamly
                differed;
                the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                looking
                towards
                the <hi>East,</hi> whereof more hereafter; and the
                <hi>Jews</hi>
                praying
                towards
                the <hi>West,</hi> if in the Temple, because the Ark by
                Gods
                appointment was
                placed
                in the <hi>West</hi> end thereof. Otherwise when they
                were
                abroad, or in foreign Countreys,
                they turned
                their faces
                toward <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                from what Coast soever; as appears
                evidently
                by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s practice, when he
                was
                a Prisoner in the Land of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
              
              It is
                reported
                also out of <hi>Drusius,</hi> (a man
                exceedingly
                well skilled
                in all the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>)
                that when they prayed
                their heads
                were
                covered.
              
              Which if it were
                so, as I have no reason to suspect the Author, it
                was
                not without good cause affirmed
                by the Historian (if one should look no further than those
                outward circumstances)
                <hi>Novos illic ritus,  caeteris mortalibus
                contrarios;</hi>
              
              the very same with that which is
                affirmed
                of them
                in the book of <hi>Hester,</hi> viz. <hi>their
                Laws
                are diverse from all people.</hi>
                Finally,
              
              at the ending
                of their prayers,
                the people which were
                present used
                to say <hi>Amen;</hi> which word from thence
                hath
                been
                derived
                and incorporated
                into all the Languages
                which make profession of the faith. Only observe that they
                had
                several <hi>Amens</hi>
                amongst them;
              
              The first of which they called
                <hi>Pupillum,</hi> when one understandeth
                not what he answers;
                the second <hi>Surreptum,</hi> when he
                saith
                <hi>Amen,</hi> before the prayer be
                fully
                ended;
                the third is
                <hi>Otiosum,</hi> when a man thinks
                of something else, and so saith
                it idly;
                the fourth <hi>Justorum,</hi> of the just, when a
                mans
                mind is
                set on his devotions,
                and thinks
                upon no other thing. And so much of the
                Rites
                and Gestures
                which they used
                in prayer.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
              But it is
                well observed
                by <hi>Aynsworth,</hi>
              
              that as the Lamps
                (mention whereof is
                made
                in the 30th. of <hi>Exodus</hi>) do
                signifie
                the light of Gods
                Word, and Incense, the Sacrifice of
                prayers;
              
              so the doing
                of both these at one time, (the Incense
                being
                to be offered
                when the Lamps
                were
                either dressed
                or lighted,
                as before was
                said)
                did
                signifie
                the joyning
                of the word with prayer. We must look therefore in the
                next place what room there was,
                or whether any room at all for reading
                of the Law in Gods
                holy Temples.
                And first for that of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                taking
                the Temple in the largest
                and most ample sense, not only for the House, but the
                Courts
                and Out-works;
                it was
                ordained
                by <hi>Moses</hi>
                in the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that there the Law
                should publickly
                be read at the end of every seven
                years,
                to the Congregation. <hi>At the end of every seven
                years</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>in the solemnity of the year of release, at the
                feast of Tabernacles,
                when all</hi> Israel <hi>is
                come to appear before the Lord their God in the place that
                he shall choose, thou shalt
                read this Law before
                all</hi> Israel,
              
              <hi>in their hearing.</hi>
                But then withal, we must take notice that such a
                reading
                as is
                there commanded,
                could not be taken
                as a part of the publick
                Liturgy. For by the order and prescript of
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                the Law was
                to be read publickly
                before the people in the seventh
                year only, in the year of release; because then
                Servants
                being
                manumitted
                from their bondage, and Debtors
                from the danger of their Creditors,
                they might attend
                the hearing
                of the Law with the greater
                chearfulness:
                And in the feast of Tabernacles,
                because it lasted
                longer
                than the other Festivals,
                and so it might be read with the
                greater
                leisure; and then it was
                but this Law too, the book of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> This
                as it was
                to be performed
                in that place alone, in which the Lord should choose to
                place his Tabernacle, and afterwards
                to build his Temple; so makes
                it little, if at all, unto the frequent
                reading
                of the Law in the House of God. It's true that
                <hi>Philo</hi> tells
                us in a book not extant, that <hi>Moses</hi>
                did
                ordain the publick
                reading
                of the Law every <hi>Sabbath</hi>
                day.
              
              , c. <hi>What then
                did</hi>
                Moses
                <hi>order to be dene on the</hi> Sabbath <hi>day? He
                did
                appoint</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>that we should meet all in some place together,
                and there sit down with modesty and a general
                filence,</hi> , <hi>to hear the Law,
                that none plead ignorance thereof. Which custom we
                continue still</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>breakning with wonderful silence to the Word of
                God, unless perhaps we give some joyful
                acclamation
                on the bearing
                of it; some of the Priests,
                if any present, or otherwise some of the
                Elders
                reading
                the Law, and then expounding
                it till the night came
                on.</hi> But hereof, by the leave of <hi>Philo,</hi> we
                must make some doubt. This was
                indeed the custom in our Saviours
                time, and when <hi>Philo</hi> lived;
                and he was
                willing, as it seems,
                to setch the pedigree thereof as high as might be. So
                <hi>Salianus</hi> tells
                him
                on the like occasion. <hi>Videtur</hi> Philo <hi>Judaeorum
                morem in Synogogis disserendi, antiquitate donare
                voluisse, quem </hi> Christe
                <hi> Apostolis
                observatum legimus.</hi>
              
              And we must make the same Answer to <hi>Josephus</hi>
                also, who tells
                us of their Law-maker, that he appointed
                not that they should only hear the Law once or twice a
                year, no oftner;
                , c.
              
              but that once every week we should come together to hear
                the Law, that so we might become the more perfect in it.
                Which thing, saith
                he, all other Law givers
                did
                omit. And so did
                <hi>Moses</hi>
                too by <hi>Josephus</hi>'s leave. For
                besides
                that no such order or command is
                to be found in the books
                of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                there were
                not then, nor long time after, any set
                places
                destinate to religious Uses,
                but the holy Tabernacle. And how the people
                being
                planted
                all about the Countrey,
                could be assembled
                every week before the Tabernacle, or
                afterwards
                (unto the Temple) weekly, let <hi>Philo</hi> and
                <hi>Josephus</hi> judge. And this
                appears
                more plainly
                by the Book of God, where we are
                told
                that K. <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> sent
                abroad his Visitors,
                who carried
                <hi>the Book of the Law of the Lord with
                them,</hi>
              
              <hi>and went
                through all the Cities
                of</hi> Judaea, <hi>and taught
                the people.</hi> A needless Office,
                had
                it been
                as those Authors
                tell us; if all the people met
                together weekly to be taught
                the Law. But that which follows
                of <hi>Josiah,</hi> is
                more full than this. Of whom
                it is
                recorded,
                that when <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the High Priest, in
                looking
                over the decays
                and ruins
                of the Temple, had
                found a book of the Law, which lay
                hidden
                there, and brought
                the same unto the King; how the good Prince upon the
                <hi>hearing
                of the words
                of the Law, rent his Garments;</hi>
              
              and not so only, but <hi>gathered
                together all the Elders
                of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Hierusalem,
                <hi>and read in their ears
                all the words
                of the Book,</hi> and joyned
                together <hi>in a Covenant with the Lord their God.</hi>
                Had
                it been
                formerly
                the custom to read the law each <hi>Sabbath,</hi> every
                week once at least unto all the people, neither
                had
                that religious Prince been
                so ignorant of it, nor had
                the finding
                of the book been
                counted
                for so strange an
                accident; nor could it be to any purpose to call the
                People altogether from their several
                dwellings,
                only to hear the Law read to them,
                and go home again, if it were
                read amongst them
                weekly on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> days,
                and that of ordinary course. So that
                whatever
              
              
              <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Josephus</hi> say, there
                was
                no weekly reading
                of the Law, either as a distinct
                and special duty, or as an
                ordinary part of the publick
                Liturgy, during the standing
                of the first Temple, which was
                that of <hi>Solomon.</hi> For further proof whereof, if we
                but look into Chronology, it will there appear, that the
                finding
                of the book of God before remembred,
                did
                happen in the 3412. yer
                of the worlds
                Creation,
              
              not forty years
                before the desolation of that Temple; in which short
                space, the Princes
                being
                careless, and the times
                distracted,
                we have no reason to expect such a
                blessed
                Ordinance.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in the second Temple, or rather whilst it
                stood
                and flourished,
              
              the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
                grew
                to be read more constantly
                unto the people, than it had
                been
                formerly.
                Not every seventh
                year only, on the feast of Tabernacles,
                as had
                before been
                ordered
                and set down by <hi>Moses;</hi>
                but upon every <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, and each solemn
                meeting,
                and sometimes
                on the week-days
                also; nor only in the Temple of
                <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                as it used
                to be, but in the Towns
                and principal places
                of each several Tribe; and then and there they
                did
                not only read the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which
                was
                the book prescribed
                by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                but the whole body of the Law. Which excellent and useful
                Ordinance is
                generally
                referred
                to <hi>Ezra,</hi> a Priest by calling,
                and very skilful in the Laws
                of <hi>Moses;</hi>
                who having
                taken
                great pains
                to seek out the Law, and other parts
                and portions
                of the book of God, digested
                and disposed
                them
                in that form and method, in which we have
                them
                at the present. Of this see <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> l. 3. c.
                25. <hi>Tertullian de habitu mulierum, Clemens Alexandr.
                Strom.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Chrysost. Homil.</hi> 8. <hi>in
                epist. ad Hebraeos,</hi> and divers
                others. And if we place this Ordinance or Institution
                introduced
                by <hi>Ezra,</hi>
              
              in the 3610. year of the Creation, which
                was
                the time wherein that solemn reading
                of the Law was
                kept,
                which we find mentioned
                in the viii. of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> there will occur
                betwixt that time and the first general Council
                holden
                in <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                490. years,
                or thereabouts.
                Which might be ground enough to the Apostle to affirm of
                <hi>Moses,</hi>
                that in <hi>the old time he had
                them
                that preached
                him,
                being
                read in the</hi> Synagogues
                <hi>every Sabbath day;</hi>
              
              and yet not go so high as <hi>Philo</hi> and
                <hi>Josephus</hi> do, to setch the pedigree, or original
                rather of the Institution.
                This then I take to be unquestionable, that the weekly
                reading
                of the Law was
                brought
                into the Jewish Church in the time of <hi>Ezra;</hi> and
                being
                brought
                in, I take it as unquestionable, that it
                was
                used
                as a part of the daily Office, an
                ordinary portion of the publick
                Liturgy. Not to be read at the discretion of the Minister,
                as his own choice or chance directed,
                and much les as an
                exercise to take up the time whilst one man
                tarried
                for anothers coming,
                until the Congregation were
                grown
                full, and fit for other business; as in some
                Churches
                of the Reformation it is
                used
                of late; but as a special portion of the service which
                they did
                to God. And this appears
                by the division of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
                into those great sections
                which they call the <hi>Parasha,</hi>
                being
                in number 54. which they read in the 52
                <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
                of the year, joyning
                two of the shortest
                twice together, that the whole might be
                finished
                in a years
                space.
              
              Of this thus write the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                Doctors.
                <hi>It is,
                say they, a common custom throughout all</hi> Israel,
                <hi>that they finish wholly
                the reading
                of the Law in one year, beginning
                in the</hi> Sabbath <hi>which is
                after the feast of Tabernacles,
                at the first section of</hi> Genesis; <hi>in the second,
                at</hi> These are the Generations
                of <hi>Noah; in the third, at</hi> The Lord
                said
                to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. xii. 1. c. <hi>So they read
                and go on in this order, till they have
                ended
                the Law at the feast of Tabernacles.</hi>
              
              By which it seems
                that as the form of their publick
                service was
                not voluntary, so neither were
                the parts
                thereof uncertain, but all set down in rule and order by
                the authority of the Church, and the wisdom of the
                Governours
                and chief Rulers
                in it, as might conduce best to the glory of God, and the
                edification of his people. Nor was
                this all that <hi>Ezra</hi> did
                in the advancement of Gods
                service, of his publick
                worship. For unto him,
                appointed
                thereunto by the Authority of the Consistory, the
                <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                generally
                ascribe those eighteen Prayers
                or Benedictions,
                so much in use amongst the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                Of which thus <hi>Maimony. Descripsit cunctas
                benedictiones</hi> Ezra,
              
              <hi>c. Ezra</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>composed
                all those Benedictions,
                which by the Consistory were
                enjoyned
                to be perpetually
                observed,
                so that it was
                not lawful to change or alter them,
                neither to add unto them,
                or diminish from them;
                every alteration of those</hi> formulas, <hi>which by
                their Wise-men
                were
                devised
                and confirmed
                in those Benedictions,
                being
                accounted
                for a fault.</hi> And this was
                done,
                as the same <hi>Rabbin</hi> doth
                inform us in
                another place, <hi>Ut scilicet in cujuslibet ore bene
                disponerentur, omnesque eas discerent,</hi>
                c.
              <q>
                That every man might have them
                  in his mouth, and be perfect in
                  them,
                
                and that thereby the prayers
                  of the rude and ignorant might be as
                  compleat,
                  as those of a more eloquent tongue.
              </q>
              Of these eighteen the three first, and the three alst
                related
                to the glory of God, the other twelve (as it
                is
                noted
                in the <hi>Gemara Hierosolymit.</hi>) <hi>ad ea
              
              
              
              quae humano generi necessaria,</hi>
              
              to such things
                as were
                necessary for the life of man; or as it
                is
                inlarged
                by <hi>Maimony,</hi> to all those
                things
                <hi>quae singulis hominibus habenda in votis,</hi> which
                either do concern particular men,
                or are thought necessary to the State or
                Nation. These
                Prayers
                or Benedictions
                thus composed,
                were
                not alone thought necessary for all
                sorts
                of people, and therefore called
                by the <hi>Jews,
                preces officii necessario praestandi,</hi>
                an
                office of necessity to be performed;
              
              but used
                both by Priest and People, as an
                ordinary
                part of their publick
                Liturgy. Whereof we are thus told
                by <hi>Rabbi Maimony. Publicus Minister seu universitatis
                aut populi Apostolus liberat plebem ab officio suo hic
                praestando,</hi>
                c.
              
              <q>The publick
                Minister (or the Apostle, as they
                called
                him,
                of the Congregation)
                did
                ease the people of this service, if when he
                said
                the prayers
                they did
                hearken
                to him,
                and unto every Benediction answered
                <hi>AMen;</hi> for by so doing
                the people also are conceived
                to pray. But this, saith
                he, is
                only in such cases,
                w hen the people is
                not perfect in those prayers,
                or cannot say the same by heart: for they who can
                repeat the
                prayers,
                do not aright discharge their duty as they ought to do, in
                case they did
                not pray themselves with the publick
                Minister.</q>
              And so much for the Prayers
                and Benedictions
                devised
                by <hi>Ezra.</hi> Which had
                they been
                the very <hi>first stinted
                forms
                of prayer which ever had
                been
                heard
                of in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church,</hi>
              
              as some men
                give out (although indeed it be not so): it would make
                more than they imagine, both for the Authority and
                Antiquity of set forms
                of worship.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to return again unto the Reading
                of the Law,
              
              set on foot by <hi>Ezra,</hi> besides
                that by this institution the reading
                of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
                became
                an
                ordinary part of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Liturgy for the
                <hi>Sabbath</hi> days,
                he caused
                it also to be read <hi>upon the second and the
                fift
                days</hi>
                (being
                our <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thursday</hi>) <hi>that they
                might not rest three days
                from hearing
                the Law; and at the Evening prayer of the</hi> Sabbath
                <hi>days,
                because of idle persons,</hi>
                who perhaps were
                absent at the Morning service.
              
              The difference was
                only this, that in these Readings
                on the by (if I may so call them)
                the Minister or the Reader was
                not tyed
                to read the whole Section, or <hi>Parasha,</hi> as upon
                the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but was
                therein left unto himself, conditioned
                that he read no less than ten verses
                at each several
                reading,
                and that there were
                three men
                to read it on the days
                aforesaid. Now to this reading
                of the Law in the Congregation every <hi>Sabbath</hi> day,
                was
                also added
                at some times,
                and on some occasions,
                the Exposition of the same; and that I find to have
                been
                done
                two ways,
                either by way of Comment and Application, or else by
                reading
                with the Law some part of passage of the
                Prophets,
                as seemed
                most parallel unto it. Of these the first may seem to take
                beginning
                from the Act of <hi>Ezra,</hi> who in that
                famous
                reading
                of the Law, mention whereof is
                made
                in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> cap. viii. not only
                caused
                a Pulpit of wood to be provided
                for that purpose, that so he might be
                heard
                the better; but placed
                about the same divers
                Priests
                and Levites,
                to expound the Text, and give the sense and
                meaning
                of it, that so the people might the better understand the
                reading.
                Whereof, as of a thing never used
                before, the reason is
                thus given
                by <hi>Torniellus,</hi>
                because the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, wherein the
                Scriptures
                were
                first written,
                was
                grown
                strange unto them.
              
              <hi>Chaldaico seu Syriaco idiomate in locum ejus
                surrogato,</hi> the <hi>Syriack</hi>
                or <hi>Chaldee</hi> language being
                generally
                received
                in the place thereof. And hereunto
                agrees
                <hi>Cunaeus,</hi> who saith
                expresly,
                that whilst the former Temple stood,
                <hi>Interpretatio magistrorum
                commentatio nulla,</hi> there was
                no gloss or exposition of the Law,
                made
                (as of course) unto the people:
              
              That office being
                supplyed,
                when there was
                occasion, by such holy Prophets
                as God raised
                amongst them
                at extraordinary times,
                and for no ordinary purposes.
                But that these Expositions
                of the Law thus begun
                by <hi>Ezra,</hi> were
                afterwards
                used
                constantly
                amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
                every <hi>Sabbath</hi> day; as I do no where find it, so I
                dare not say it. If so it were,
                it could not be done
                presently,
                but in tract of time, of which more anon. In the mean time
                we will behold the second kind of
                Exposition
                which before we spake
                of, that which was
                made
                by reading
                with the Law some part or passage of the
                Prophets,
                which came
                near unto it. The first beginning
                of the which the <hi>Jews</hi>
                refer unto the furious raging
                of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> furnamed
                <hi>Epiphanes,</hi>
                who had
                not only defiled
                the Temple, and forbid the use of Circumcision, but also
                did
                prohibit the
                reading
                of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                upon pain of death. On which occasion, and to prevent the
                mischief which might thereby grow, if the
                reading
                of the Law should be quite left off; they
                chose
                chapters
                and divisions
                out of the writings
                of the Prophets,
                which were
                most answerable to those parts
                of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                which were
                read before;
                as for this Section of the Law, <hi>In the
                beginning
                God Created,</hi>
                c. They made
                choice of that in <hi>Esa.</hi> xlii. 5. <hi>So
                saith
                the Lord, the Creator of Heaven and Earth,</hi>
                continuing
                to the 11. verse of the xliii. These
                fractions
                of the Law they called
                <hi>Haphtara.</hi> And
              
              
              though the tyranny of <hi>Antiochus</hi>
                being
                over-blown,
              
              they fell again unto the reading
                of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                as was
                used
                before; yet they continued
                still the reading
                of the holy Propohets, as finding
                it a very wholsome
                institution; and sometimes
                joyned
                thereunto such Expositions
                as the <hi>Scribes</hi>
                and <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                made
                upon the same, according
                to their several Talents.
                Certain I am,
                that so it was
                in our Saviurs time, and in the time of his
                Apostles.
                For thus we find in S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel, that when
                our Saviour came
                into the Synagogue <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and
                stood
                up to read,</hi>
              
              <hi>there was
                delivered
                him
                the book of the Prophet</hi> Esay;
                and that when he had
                read the place, <hi>he closed
                the Book, and gave
                it again unto the Minister</hi> (the Apostle of the
                Congregation, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                call him)
                and afterwards
                expounded
                and applyed
                the Text. And in his History of the
                Apostles,
                we find that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                being
                present at the Synagogue of <hi>Antiochia,</hi>
              
              <hi>on the</hi> Sabbath <hi>day,</hi> sate down; and that
                after the <hi>reading
                of the Law and Prophets,
                the Rulers
                of the Synagogue sent
                unto them
                saying,
                Ye Men
                and Brethren, if ye have any word of Exhortation for the
                people, say on,</hi> c. In which we have at once the
                custom of those latter times
                for the expounding
                of the Law in the Congregation, as
                being
                by this time made
                a part of Gods
                holy Service; as the place and room also which it
                held
                in the publick
                Liturgy; that is
                to say, next to the reading
                of the Law and Prophets;
                as now the Sermon followeth
                on the reading
                of the Epistle and the Gospel. As for the gesture which
                was
                used
                by these several Ministers
                in the discharge of those distinct and several
                Offices,
                I find that the reading
                of the Law and Prophets,
                and the exposition of the same,
                was
                with the face of him
                that did
                it towards
                the face of the people; whereof see <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 16.
                And that the Minister who read the
                Prayers
                (whom
                they called
                the <hi>Apparitour</hi> of the Synagogue)
                stood
                with his back towards
                the people, his face being
                turned
                unto the Ark.
            </p>
            <p>
              This leads
                me on unto another Institution not
                known
                before the building of the second Temple, or the
                times
                of <hi>Ezra,</hi>
              
              which was
                the setting
                up of Synagogues
                and Oratories
                throughout the Countrey.
                Of these we find no mention in the former
                times,
                and but little Use; the total sum of all
                Gods
                publick
                worship being
                cast into the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                For where it is
                supposed
                by some that there were
                Synagogues
                of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                in the time of <hi>David,</hi> who for the proof thereof
                did
                produce these words,
                <hi>They have burnt up all the Synagogues
                of God in the Land,</hi> Psal. lxxiv. the supposition and
                the proof are alike infirm. For not to quarrel the
                Translation which is
                directly
                different
                from the <hi>Greek</hi> and Vulgar
                <hi>Latine,</hi>
                and somewhat from the former <hi>English,</hi> this
                <hi>Psalm</hi> if writ by <hi>David,</hi>
                was
                not meant
                by him
                of any present misery which befel
                the Church. There had
                been
                no such havock
                made
                thereof in all <hi>David</hi>'s time, as
                is
                there complained
                of. And therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> rather
                thinks,
                <hi>ad tempus Antiochi
                referri has
                querinonias,</hi>
                that <hi>David,</hi> as inspired
                with the spirit of Prophecy,
              
              reflected
                on those wretched and calamitous
                times,
                wherein <hi>Antiochus</hi> made
                such havock
                of the Church of God. Nor was
                there any Use of them
                in those former times,
                because no reading
                of the Law, of ordinary course, in the Congregation, as
                before was
                said.
                But when the former course was
                changed,
                and that the reading
                of the Law to the People of God
                was
                not licensed
                only, but enjoyned,
                then began
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                to build them
                Synagogues;
                which afterwards
                increased
                so strangely,
                that there was
                no Town of any moment throughout
                all <hi>Judaea,</hi> nor almost any City where they
                dwelt
                as Strangers,
                in which they did
                not build some Synagogue. God certainly
                had
                so disposed
                it in his holy Counsels,
                that so his Word might be more generally
                known
                over all the world, and a more easie
                way laid
                open for the receipt of the Messiah
                whom
                he meant
                to send; that so <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                and the Temple there might by degrees
                be lessened
                in their reputation; and men
                might learn that neither of them
                was
                the only place where they ought to worship. As for their
                Oratories,
                which before I spake
                of, although I find not their Original, yet I can tell you
                of their Use. For this, saith
                <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of them.
              
              , c. There
                were
                (saith
                he) amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
                without their Cities
                certain Oratories,
                whither the people did
                sometimes
                resort to make their prayers
                unto the Lord. And this he proves
                out of the xvi. of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                where it is
                said,
                <hi>And on the Sabbath we went
                out of the City by a Rivers
                side, where prayer was
                wont to be made,</hi>
                vers. 3. <hi>i.e. Ubi de more  consuetudine haberi
                conventus consueverant,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi>
                notes
                upon the Text. The <hi>Latines</hi>
                called
                them
                from the Use they were
                put unto <hi>Proseuchas;</hi> as, <hi>in qua te quaero
                Proseucha,</hi> in the Poet <hi>Juvenal.</hi>
              
              And although <hi>Beza</hi> take those <hi>Proseuchas,</hi>
                to be the very same with the <hi>Jewish</hi>
                Synagogues;
              
              yet sure there was
                a special difference between them.
                For in those <hi>Proseuchas</hi> or
                <hi>Oratories</hi>
                they might only pray; in the Synagogues
                they might not only make their prayers,
                but also
              
              
              
              read the Law and Prophets,
                and expound the same, and in the Temple of the Lord,
                besides
                those former duties
                they might offer Sacrifice, which
                was
                not lawful to be done
                in other places.
                And to these times,
                when now the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church
                was
                settled,
                and Synagogues
                erected
                in almost all places
                for reading
                and expounding
                the Law of God, we must refer those
                passages
                from <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Josephus</hi> before
                remembred,
                which cannot possibly
                be made
                good of the former times,
                wherein this people wanted
                all conveniencies
                for those weekly meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus have we seen
                what care the Rulers
                of that Church took
                for providing
                fit and convenient places
                for the performance of Gods
                publick
                worship,
              
              and all the sacred Offices
                thereunto belonging.
                Had
                they not, think we, equal power of
                adding
                days
                and times
                to the commemorating
                of Gods
                goodness, and laying
                before him
                their afflictions,
                s well as in appointing
                places.
                Assuredly
                such power they had,
                and made
                Use thereof, according
                as they saw
                occasion. Witness the feast of <hi>Purim,</hi>
                ordained
                by <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Hester,</hi> with the consent
                and approbation of the whole people of the
                <hi>Jews,</hi>
                to be obsered on the 14 and 15 days
                of the <hi>moneth
                Adar yearly, throughout their Generations
                for evermore;</hi>
              
              <hi>that they should make them
                days
                of feasting
                and joy, and of sending
                portions
                unto one another, and gifts
                to the Poor.</hi> Nor was
                this all, to make them
                days
                of feasting
                and good fellowship, and no more than so; for this
                had
                been
                to <hi>make their belly their God,</hi> and so by
                consequence their glory must have
                been
                their shame; but in all probability, there
                were
                ordained
                set forms
                of praise and prayer for so great a mercy, and the
                continuance of the like. Those who
                conceived
                themselves to have Authority of
                instituting
                a new Festival to the Lord their God, could not but know
                they had
                Authority
                of instituting
                a new form of prayer and praise, agreeable to the
                occasion. And so much we may guess by that which
                remains
                thereof; it being
                affirmed
                by one <hi>Antonius Margarita,</hi> a
                converted
                <hi>Jew,</hi> once one of the Professors
                (for the tongue I take it) in the University of
                <hi>Leipsich,</hi>
              
              that to this day <hi>legunt diebus illis in Synagogis suis
                historiam
                istam,</hi> they read upon the days
                of the said
                Feast of the book of <hi>Hester;</hi> and
                anciently
                'twas not the custom of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church to read
                the Scripture without set forms
                of Prayers,
                and appointed
                Ceremonies.
                The like may also be affirmed
                of the , or the <hi>Feast of
                Dedication.</hi> A Feast ordained
                by <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and the
                Elders
                of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation; who
                having
                cleansed
                the Temple and set up the Altar, (which
                had
                been
                impiously
                profaned
                by <hi>Antiochus</hi>) did
                <hi>dedicate the same with Songs
                and Citternes,</hi>
              
              <hi>and with Harps
                and Cymbals;</hi>
                and that being
                done,
                ordained
                that the days
                of the Dedication should be <hi>kept
                in their season from year to year, by the space of eight
                days,</hi>
                c. <hi>with mirth and gladness.</hi> Here we find
                <hi>mirth and gladness,</hi> as before in the feast of
                <hi>Purim.</hi> And doubt we not, but there
                was
                in the Celebration of it as much <hi>spiritual mirth and
                gladness</hi> (at least in the intention of the
                founders)
                as there was
                of carnal; although the forth and manner of it have not
                come unto us. Our Saviour Christ
                had
                never honoured
                it with his blessed
                presence (as we shall see he did
                hereafter) if it had
                been
                otherwise. Besides
                which annual Feasts
                recorded
                in the holy Scripture,
                they had
                another which they called
                <hi>festivitatem legis,</hi> or the feast of the Law;
                ordained
                by the Rulers
                of the Church of <hi>Jewry,</hi> for joy that they
                had
                finished
                the publick
                reading
                of the Law in their Congregations.
                For, as before I told
                you, the <hi>Jews</hi>
                began
                the reading
                of the Law upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> after the feast of
                Tabernacles,
                and finished
                it at 5a readings,
                against the feast of Tabernacles
                came
                about again. Now 'tis observed
                by <hi>Joseph Scaliger,</hi> that the feast of
                Tabernacles
                beginning
                always
                on the 15th. of the month <hi>Tisri,</hi> and
                holding
                on until the 22d. inclusively;
                this Festival was
                always
                held
                on the morrow after, being
                the three and twentieth
                of this month. Which Feast as he
                makes
                very ancient,
              
              (<hi>cujus cultus institutio vetustissima est,</hi> as his
                own words
                are) grounding
                the same upon the reading
                of the Law in the time of <hi>Ezra:</hi> So I
                conceive
                their form of worship on the same,
                was
                no less ancient than those times.
                For whereas <hi>Ezra</hi> is
                confessed,
                by those who approve not Liturgies,
                to be the Author of those 18 Benedictions,
              
              so much in Use amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
                of the second Temple; some of those
                Benedictions
                seem to me to be composed
                for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of this feast, though they might
                elso serve at other times,
                as occasion was.
                Of which take this as most agreeable to the intention of
                the festival.
              
              <hi>Blessed
                art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, that
                hast
                sanctified
                us with thy Precepts,
                and given
                us command concerning
                the matters
                of the Law. And sweeten, O Lord, the
                words
                of the Law in our mouths,
                and in the mouth of thy people the house of</hi> Israel;
                <hi>and make us all, and our Children,
                and our Childrens
                Children
                knowers
                of thy Name, and learners
                of thy Law for it self. Blessed
                art thou, O Lord, which teachest
                thy people</hi> Israel <hi>the Law.</hi> So far the very
                words
                of the Benediction;
              
              
              a Benediction made
                by the self same Author, who as it
                is
                conceived
                by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> did
                ordain the Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
              The like Authority was
                exercised
                by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church in
                Instituting
                set and appointed
                Fasts
                for the chastising
                of the body, and the afflicting
                of the soul,
              
              that so Gods
                worship might go forward with the
                greater
                fervour. Of these we find some mentioned
                in the Prophecy of the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> as
                <hi>viz. the Fasts
                of the fifth and seventh
                moneth,</hi>
                cap. vii. v. 5. <hi>The Fasts
                of the fourth and tenth
                moneths,</hi>
                cap. viii. v. 19. The several
                occasions
                of the which you may see elsewhere.
                Besides
                which Annual Fasts,
                they used
                to fast upon the <hi>Monday</hi> and the <hi>Thursday;
                Jejuno his in Sabbato,</hi> said
                the Vainglorious
                <hi>Pharisee</hi> in S. <hi>Lukes</hi>
                Gospel; and many times
                they did
                impose upon themselves
                a seven days
                Fast, the better to profess their sorrow and bewail their
                sins.
              
              For which consult 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxxi. 13.  1
                <hi>Chron.</hi> x. 12. 2 <hi>Esdras</hi> v. 13, 20. And we
                have reason to believe that there
                were
                certain and determinate forms
                of publick
                worship for all the residue, because we find
                them
                on those last. What was
                the course observed
                in reading
                of the Law upon the second and fifth
                days
                of the week, we have seen
                before; and shall add only this at present, that they
                Assembled
                in those days
                in their several Synagogues,
                not only in the greater
                Towns,
                but the smaller
                Villages;
              
              as the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                tell us. But for the seven days
                Fast, the form and order of the same,
                according
                as it was
                performed
                by those which dwelt
                in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                was
                this as followeth,
                <hi>When they prayed
                after this order in</hi> Hierusalem,
                <hi>they went
                into the Mountain of the Temple, against the East gate.
                And when the Apostle of the Congregation</hi> (<hi>the
                same who in S.</hi> Luke <hi>is
                called
                the Minister,</hi> cap. iv. 20.)
                <hi>was
                come unto the prayer which began
                with this,</hi> He that heard
                <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                c. <hi>and ended
                with these words,</hi>
                viz. Blessed
                be thou, O Lord God our God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                from generation to generation: <hi>The People
                answered,</hi>
                Blessed
                be the name of his glorious Kingdom to all
                generations,
                and for evermore. <hi>Then said
                the Officer of the Synagogue unto the
                Priests
                which blew
                the Trumpets,</hi>
                Sound ye the Sons
                of <hi>Aaron,</hi> sound, <hi>and then
                prayed
                again.</hi> And though it seemeth
                by the <hi>Rabbin,</hi>
              
              that this prescribed
                form was
                fitted
                only to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of
                <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                yet there is
                little question to be made,
                but that it served
                also for all the Synagogues
                about <hi>Judaea;</hi> there being
                no imaginable reason why a prescript form of
                publick
                worship (conceive me in the moral
                parts
                thereof) which was
                observed
                in the Temple, should not be used
                in the Synagogues;
                which in performance of Gods
                service, was
                to take pattern from the Temple. Only some difference
                there was
                in the present case, but such a difference as
                is
                a matter of meer
                nicety, not of any moment. For when this form
                was
                used
                in the Synagogue, the People answered
                <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of the Prayer: But when they
                used
                it in the Mountain of the Temple, that
                is,
                within the outmost compass of it, their Answer
                was,
                <hi>Blessed
                be the name of his glorious Kingdom,</hi> c. as
                before was
                said,
                it being
                not usual with the People as the
                <hi>Rabbins</hi>
                note,
              
              to answer <hi>Amen</hi> within the Mountain of the Temple.
                So punctual were
                they in their forms,
                as not to vary in a word or title, from that which
                was
                prescribed
                in their publick
                Liturgies.
                And finally,
                that they had
                a prescribed
                form of words
                for their solemn and occasional
                Feasts,
                is
                evident by that of <hi>Abel,</hi> cap. ii. 17. where the
                words
                occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to look back upon the Celebration of the daily
                Sacrifices,
              
              besides
                the testimonies
                of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                and that of the <hi>Samaritan Chronicle</hi>
                produced
                before; we have it thus described
                by Jesus the Son of <hi>Syrac,</hi>
                an
                Author of unquestionable credit to the point in hand.
                Speaking
                of <hi>Simon</hi> the Son of <hi>Onias,</hi> who
                was
                the High Priest at the time, and his
                officiating
                at the Altar, he proceeds
                as followeth.
              
              <hi>And finishing
                the Service at the Altar, that he might adorn the
                Offering
                of the most high Almighty, he stretched
                out his hand to the Cup (wherewith the
                Drink-offering
                was
                to be made)
                and poured
                of the blood of the Grape; he poured
                out at the foot of the Altar, a sweet
                smelling
                savour unto the most high King of all. Then
                shouted
                the Sons
                of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and sounded
                the silver Trumpets,
                and made
                a great noise to be heard,
                for a remembrance before the most High. Then all the
                People hasted
                together, and fell down to the Earth upon their
                faces,
                towards
                the Lord God Almighty the most High. The
                Singers
                also sung
                praises
                with their voices,
                with great variety of sounds
                was
                there made
                sweet melody. And the People besought
                the Lord most High by prayer, before
                him
                that is
                merciful, till the Solemnity of the Lord
                was
                ended,
                and they had
                finished
                his Service. Then went
                he down, and lifted
                up his hands
                over the whole Congregation of the
                Children
                of</hi> Israel, <hi>to give the
                blessing
                of the Lord with his lips,
                and to rejoyce
                in his Name. And they bowed
                themselves down to worship the second time, that they
                might receive a blessing
                from the most High.</hi> So far the Author of
                <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> who lived
                in the latter end of <hi>Ptolemy Euergetes</hi> King of
                <hi>Egypt,</hi> as himself tells
                us in his Preface. Now in these
                words
                of
              
              
              
              his, if we mark them
                well, we find particularly
                all the parts
                of publick
                worship which before we spake
                of. The daily Sacrifice performed
                by the Priests
                alone; the moral part of Gods
                divine service joyntly
                discharged
                by Priests
                and People. The Singers
                we find singing
                Hymns
                and Songs
                of Praise to the Lord their God, the People first
                making
                Confession of their Sins,
                and to that purpose falling
                flat upon their faces;
                and after pouring
                out their souls
                in prayer for his grace and mercy; the High Priest
                giving
                of the blessing
                to the Congregation, as the Lord
                appointed;
                the people bowing
                down and worshipping
                at the receiving
                of the same. And all this in a regular and
                prescribed
                way; nothing in all the course thereof
                being
                left unto the liberty of Priest or People, but the
                confession of their private and particular
                sins,
                which every one had
                leave to cast in what mould he would. As for the
                reading
                of the Law and Prophets,
                it's true we find no mention of it in this description of
                the service by the Son of <hi>Syrac.</hi> But then perhaps
                the reason was,
                because the reading
                of the Law was
                only used
                as an
                ordinary
                part of the publick
                Liturgy on the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
                days;
                and it appeareth
                not by the place that this was
                done
                upon the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Finally
                such, and none but such, was
                the daily service of the Synagogue,
                excepting
                that there was
                no Sacrifice to be done
                therein. Of
                which this <hi>Maimony</hi> the
                learnedest
                and most exact of all the <hi>Rabbins:
                Let a man</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>go always
                Morning and Evening to the Synagogue, for his Prayer
                is
                not heard
                always
                but in the Synagogue. And he that
                dwelleth
                in a City where there is
                a Synagogue, and prayeth
                not there with the Congregation, this
                is
                he that is
                called
                a bad Neighbour.</hi>
              
              And certainly,
                as 'tis well noted
                to my hand, he well may be called
                a bad Neighbour, who will not lend his
                Neighbours
                Prayers
                the strength of his own; but himself
                finds
                the fruit of his own bad Neighbourhood, when his own
                prayers
                want the assistance of his Neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mentioning
                of Jesus the Son of <hi>Syrac</hi>
                serves
                here most fitly
                as an
                Usher to make room for Jesus the Son of God,
              
              whose testimony to the point in hand, whether by way of
                Affirmation or of Approbation, will be worth our
                having.
                For sure there's no man so profanely
                impudent, as to affirm; so impiously
                wretched, as to think, that Christ our Saviour would have
                kept
                himself to the <hi>Jewish</hi> forms,
                in case the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church
                had
                done
                amiss in the devising
                of such forms
                and other Ceremonies,
                or wanted
                good Authority
                to enjoynn the same. In those points
                therefore, wherein he conformed
                himself to
                the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ordinances,
                there is
                no question to be made,
                but that those Ordinances
                were
                conform to the Word of God. When they
                were
                otherwise in such points
                as they made
                the Word of God of <hi>none effect, by their
                traditions,</hi>
                he therein left them
                to themselves, and gave
                no countenance at all unto them
                by the authority of his practice. Their
                Synagogues,
                for which they had
                no special warrant from the Word of God, he
                liked
                well enough, and therefore often
                honoured
                them
                with his blessed
                presence.
                The weekly reading
                of the Law and Prophets,
              
              for which there was
                no order and command of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                or of any other of Gods
                Secretaries,
                (for ought which hitherto
                appears)
                he approved
                right well; taking
                the book, when it was
                offered
                by the Minister, reading
                the place or lesson destinate to the present day, and
                after preaching
                on the same.
              
              The course of publick
                worship in the holy Temple, he esteemed
                so highly,
                that he confirmed
                the title given
                unto it in the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                namely that glorious
                Attribute of <hi>Domus Orationis,</hi> or
                <hi>an
                House of Prayer.</hi> And for the Feast of
                Dedication,
                though of no other institution than
                meerly
                Ecclesiastical and humane, he thought it no disparagement
                to the Lord and Master of the Feast to keep and celebrate
                the same with the rest of the people.
              
              <hi>It was
                at</hi> Hierusalem
                <hi>the Feast of the Dedication: And Jesus
                walked
                in the Temple in</hi> Solomons
                <hi>Porch.</hi> But that wherein he
                shewed
                himself most punctually
                conformable to the <hi>Jewish</hi>
                rites,
                was
                in the keeping
                of the Passeover.
                Of which,
              
              thus <hi>Aynsworth</hi> in his notes
                on <hi>Exodus. These observations
                of the Jews</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>whiles
                their Common-wealth stood,
                and to this day, may give light unto some
                particulars
                in the Passeover,
                which Christ kept;
                as</hi> viz. <hi>why they lay down one
                leaning
                on anothers bosom,</hi> Joh. xiii. 23. <hi>contrary to the
                first institution of it; why he rose from Supper, and
                washed,
                and sate down again,</hi> Joh. xiii. 4, 5, 12. <hi>why he
                blessed
                or gave
                thanks
                for the bread apart, and for the cup apart,</hi> Mark.
                xiv. 22, 23. <hi>why it is
                said
                he took
                the cup after Supper,</hi> Luk. xxii. 20. <hi>And
                finally,
                why they sung
                an
                Hymn or Psalm at the end of the Supper,</hi> Mat. xxvi.
                30. <hi>Beza</hi> goeth
                somewhat further yet, and to those
                points
                before observed,
                addeth
                also this, <hi>Ex iis demum intelligitur, quaenam sit illa
                panis
                benedictio, fracti, 
                porrectio,
                itidemque poculi mutua praebitio;</hi>
              
              by which he makes
                the blessing,
                breaking
                and distributing
                both of the bread and cup in the
                blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to have been
                borrowed
                from those Rites.
                But he that hath
                gone
                furthest
                is
                the famous <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who doth affirm
              
              
              expresly
                of our Saviour Christ,
              
              <hi>nihil immutasse in ritu,</hi> that he
                did
                vary in no point of circumstance from the usual
                rites,
                save that he changed
                those words
                which the Ancients
                used,
                in giving
                to their guests
                the Bread and Wine; and substituted
                others in the place thereof, more
                sutable
                to his intention. So that whatever poor opinion the world
                hath
                entertained
                of late concerning
                Liturgies
                and set forms
                of Prayer; and of the authority of the Church in
                ordering
                matters
                which concern Gods
                publick
                worship: It seems
                our Lord and Saviour was
                persuaded
                otherwise, he had
                not else so punctually
                and precisely
                conformed
                unto the one, and obeyed
                the other. And therefore, O most
                blessed
                Saviour, since thou didst
                think it no dishonour to thy glorious Majesty to frame thy
                self unto those publick
                forms
                and rites
                of religious worship which were
                prescribed
                by that Church, wherein thou didst
                vouchsafe to sojourn for a certain season: Continue unto
                us that humble modesty, that we may
                gladly
                yield obedience to those forms
                of worship, which were

              Thus having
                drawn
                down the beginning
                and success of Liturgies
                (or of prescribed
                and determinate Forms
                of Worship,
              
              call it which you will) from the first
                times
                unto the best; from the first giving
                of the Law to the end thereof: we might now see in what
                condition they have stood
                in the Christian Church, and that too in the
                purest
                and best times
                of Christianity. But we must first observe what the
                Gentiles
                did,
                who being
                another of those integral parts
                whereof the Church of Christ consisted
                (both Jews
                and Gentiles
                making
                up one Church to our Lord and Saviour) and
                having
                their own forms
                and rites
                of religious worship (if the Idolatrous service of their
                gods
                may be so entituled)
                are in the next place to be looked
                upon; that we may see how univerfally
                all sorts
                of people have agreed
                in this, to institute set forms,
                and determinate rites,
                whereby to order and direct their whole
                devotions.
                And having
                shewn
                out of their most unquestionable
                Records
                and Monuments,
                with what a general consent they
                entertained
                those publick
                <hi>formulas</hi> which had
                been
                recommended
                to them
                by the former
                times;
                we shall proceed to the affairs
                of the Christian Church, so far forth as they do concern
                this present business. And then I hope it will seem
                reasonable to the indifferent
                and sober Reader, that if a prescribed
                Form of Worship hath
                been
                admitted
                in the world, <hi>semper, ab omnibus  ubique,</hi>
                according
                to the rule of <hi>Lyrinensis,</hi> at all
                times
                formerly,
                in all places
                too, and by all sorts
                of people of what Sect soever: It must
                needs
                be a most unheard of novelty to reject
                them
                now; and hazard all the publick
                worship of Almighty God, either upon no
                Forms
                at all, or such as no man is
                obliged
                to observe and hold to. A matter which which the very
                Gentiles,
                though men
                of excellent
                wits
                and eloquence thought not fit to do; their
                gods,
                though gods
                of earth, made
                of gold and silver, and far worse
                materials,
                being
                conceived
                of too great Majesty
                to be spoken
                unto, in such an
                unprepared
                and unpremeditated manner, as some
                men
                now affect to speak in, to the God of Heaven. And this we
                shall deliver in one Chapter only, with as much brevity as
                may be; and so pass forward to the
                Forms
                or Liturgies
                used
                from the first beginnings
                of the Christian Church, which is
                the matter most especially
                to be looked
                into.

              IT is
                observed
                by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
              
              
              that from the time of <hi>Adam</hi> unto that of
                <hi>Serug,</hi> there were
                no different opinions
                in the world about Religion, , no
                sides
                nor factions
                fostered
                by the Sons
                of men,
                in matters
                which concerned
                Gods
                worship; but that Gods
                Servants
                were
                distinguished
                from other men,
                by the piety and integrity of their conversation.
                . It was
                the piety and impiety of their lives,
                (saith
                he) which made
                all difference. But in the times
                of <hi>Serug,</hi> the people being
                scattered
                and divided
                into several Languages,
                and not communicating
                with each other as before they used,
                began
                to take up several opinions
                in the things
                of God, which brought
                them
                at the last unto Idolatry; their
                errors
                in the point of practice being
                grounded
                on their mispersuasions
                in point of judgment.
                Yet so, that there accrewed
                unto them
                no particular name, by which to difference
                them
                from the rest, till the days
                of <hi>Abraham;</hi> from which time forward the world
                began
                to be divided
                into <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi>
              
              , as he tells
                us after. Upon which ground it may be
                probably
                inferred,
                that in the worshipping
                of those Idols,
                <hi>Ninus,</hi> or whosoever else
                brought
                in Idolatry, retained
                that form of Sacrifice and publick
                Worship, which they had
                seen
                observed
                and practised
                in the Service of God. For <hi>Belus,</hi> the
                <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarch, the Son and
                Successor
                of <hi>Nimrod</hi> (from whom
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                in succeeding
                times
                borrowed
                the names
                of <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi>)
                being
                the first whose <hi>Statua</hi> or Image
                was
                advanced
                and worshipped,
                ,
              
              as mine Author hath
                it, by those that lived
                under his Dominion; was
                the first also unto whom
                they offered
                Sacrifices,
                and other rites
                of divine worship, ,
                saith
                the Father plainly.
                Now <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Serug</hi>
                were
                Contemporaries,
                as appears
                evidently
                in all Chronology. And therefore when <hi>Lactantius</hi>
                tell us of <hi>Meliseus</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi>
              
              <hi>primum diis sacrificasse,</hi> that he
                was
                the first who offered
                Sacrifice unto the Gods;
                it must be understood,
                with no doubt, reference to <hi>Europe,</hi> and these
                Western parts
                of the world. Or else it must be
                meant
                that he set forth the Sacrifices
                of the gods,
                after a more pompous and magnificent
                manner, than
                formerly
                had
                been
                accustomed;
                <hi>ac ritus novos, sacrorumque pompas introduxisse,</hi>
                as the words
                next following
                do seem to intimate.
              
              So that however it be true which <hi>Tully</hi>
                tells
                us, <hi>nulla gens tam barbara,</hi> that there
                was
                never any Nation known
                so rude and barbarous, which was
                not well enough persuaded
                that there was
                a God; and that it was
                imprinted
                in their souls
                by the stamp or character of nature, that God
                was
                to be Worshipped
                by them,
                and that too in the first place, (,
                said
                the <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator) yet for the form and manner
                of his Worship,
              
              the Rites
                and Sacrifices
                which they used
                in the first times
                of their Idolatry, I rather think they
                took
                it on tradition, and from hand to hand, than that the
                light of nature did
                direct them
                in it. But be this as it will, it
                comes
                all to one, as to the business now in hand; which
                aims
                no further than to shew
                that anciently
                the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                had
                their Sacrifices,
                when yet no Sacrifices
                were
                enjoyned
                by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                And if they had
                their Sacrifices,
                as 'tis plain they had,
                and took
                them
                up upon the practice of Gods
                Servants,
                as 'tis most probable they did;
                we may conceive that with those
                Sacrifices
                they did
                joyn
                such Prayers
                and Praises,
                as were
                agreeable to their occasions
                and necessities,
                when they made
                their Offerings,
                accordingly
                as had
                been
                done
                by the holy <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>
                Unto what
                purpose did
                they , which
                is
                the word that <hi>Cyril</hi> useth,
                were
                it not that they made
                their Prayers
                to those wretched Idols,
                and implored
                their favours?
            </p>
            <p>
              And it was
                partly thus in the times
                succeeding.
              
              For when the Tribes
                of <hi>Israel</hi> were
                disposed
                and setled
                into a Constituted
                Church, and had
                their prescribed
                Rites
                of Sacrifice, their Temple, Priests,
                their solemn and appointed
                times,
                and set forms
                of Worship; it was
                not long before the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                had
                the like. The difference was
                no more but this, that the first
                Sacrifices,
                and the rites
                thereof which had
                been
                used
                amongst the
                ancient <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                descended
                on them
                by tradition; whereas those later
                adjuncts
                of Religious Worship, (pardon theh profanation of the
                phrase) were
                taken
                up on imitation. And therefore as they
                had
                their Sacrifices
                and their Altars
                in the former
              
              
              times,
                in the unpolished
                ages
                of Idolatry; so by degrees
                as they grew
                more exact and punctual in their wicked
                ways,
                they set apart selected
                times
                for the performance of their Idol-worship,
                made
                choice of persons
                to attend that Service, and Consecrated
                sumptuous Houses
                to be the seat or receptacle of those several
                gods,
                to whom
                that service
                was
                intended.
                The several Gods
                in <hi>Rome,</hi> if one went
                no further, the stately and magnificent
                Temples
                unto them
                belonging,
                the several monthly
                Festivals,
                and annual Solemnities,
                together with those many Colledges
                of Priests
                maintained
                and founded
                for the Service of those several
                Gods,
                were
                proof enough of this, if there were
                no more. And though we might content our
                selves
                with this general note, yet we will speak a word or two of
                those times
                and places,
                which they had
                dedicated
                to the service of the gods
                they worshipped;
                to shew
                that though they could not reach the height of the true
                Religion, and knew
                not the intent of those legal Sacrifices,
                which were
                imposed
                upon the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                yet they resolved
                to come as near it as they could, and miss. First for the
                time, the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                hallowed
                constantly
                three days
                in the every moneth,
              
              <hi>viz.</hi> the first, the fourth, the
                seventh.
                , as it is
                in <hi>Hesiod;</hi> whereof the first
                was
                consecrated
                to <hi>Apollo,</hi> the fourth to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the
                seventh
                again unto <hi>Apollo,</hi> as is
                observed
                by <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro.</hi>
              
              And this (the last I mean) is
                noted
                by the <hi>Scholiast</hi> also. <hi>A novilunio exorsus
                laudat tres, omnes sacras dicens,</hi> septimam <hi>etiam
                ut</hi> Apollinis <hi>natalem celebrans.</hi>
                Particularly
                the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                did
                offer unto <hi>Theseus</hi> their
                greatest
                and more solemn Sacrifice upon the
                eighth
                day of <hi>October,</hi> because of his arrival on that
                day from <hi>Crete,</hi> and kept
                an
                half holiday as it were,
                , upon the eighth
                day of every moneth,
                because of his descent from <hi>Neptune,</hi> to
                whom
                the eighth
                of every month had
                before been
                Consecrated.
                The sect of Epicures
                hallowed
                the 20th. day of every Moon, it may be to their god, the
                belly; others the last of every
                moneth
                to <hi>Pluto.</hi>
              
              So for the <hi>Romans</hi>
                who came
                after in respect of time, besides
                the second day of every moneth
                to the <hi>Bonus Genius,</hi> and the
                fifteenth
                to <hi>Minerva,</hi> they consecrated
                the ninth
                to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which was
                indeed the greatest
                and most solemn of their monthly
                Holidays;
                <hi>Nundinas</hi> Joyis <hi>ferias esse ait Gravius
                Licinius,</hi> as it is
                noted
                by <hi>Macrobius.</hi> Besides
                which monthly
                times
                of worship,
              
              and those which ever private man might separate for his
                own occasions;
                both people also had
                their solemn standing
                Anniversaries,
                kept
                with great pomp, and celebrated
                with variety of Rites
                and Sacrifices;
                the Catalogue of the which who list to see, may find
                them
                gathered
                to his hand in that laborious Treatise of
                <hi>Hospinian,</hi> entituled
                <hi>De Origine festorum.</hi> By which we see, that though
                the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                did
                not keep the weekly Holiday, which
                was
                imposed
                upon the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                yet they had
                several days
                each moneth,
                as many as the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                though not the same for publick
                worship; and for the number of their Annual
                feasts,
                their times
                of pompous and more solemn worship, they
                went
                far beyond them.
                But that wherein they came
                most near the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                was
                in the building of their Temples,
                which in the Form and distribution of the
                parts
                were
                so contrived,
                as if their workmen
                had
                proceeded
                by the pattern of King <hi>Solomons</hi>
                Temple. For as the Temple (taking
                it in the circuit and out-works
                thereof) did
                contain three parts,
                <hi>viz.</hi> the Courts,
                the <hi>Sanctum,</hi> and the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi>
                according
                to their several ministeries
                by the Law required;
                so were
                the Temples
                of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                cast into three parts
                also, that is
                to say, the Courts
                or <hi>Areas,</hi>
              
              the body of the same which they
                called
                <hi>Basilicas,</hi> and last of all their <hi>Adyta,</hi>
                or more secret places,
                wherein the worshipped
                deity was
                supposed
                to be. The <hi>Areas</hi> of these
                Temples,
                and the <hi>Porticos,</hi> together with the <hi>nave</hi>
                or body of them,
                were
                easily
                accessible to all sorts
                of people; but for their <hi>Adyta,</hi> they
                were
                conceived
                to be , not to be
                trod
                upon,
              
              or looked
                into but by the Priests.
                And hereto <hi>Caesar</hi> doth agree, where
                speaking
                of the <hi>occulta  remota Templi,</hi> the secret
                and remote parts
                of their Temples,
                which sometimes
                they called
                <hi>Penetralia,</hi> and sometimes
                , he adds
                this brief note;
              
              <hi>Quo praeter sacerdotes adire fas non est,</hi> that
                none were
                suffered
                but their Priests
                to go into them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus have we found amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                Temples
                and Priests,
              
              as well as Gods
                and Sacrifices;
                and more than so, prescribed
                and determinate times,
                whereon those Priests
                and Temples
                were
                to be imployed,
                on which those gods
                were
                to be feasted
                with Oblations,
                and made
                fat with Sacrifices.
                The next thing here to be considered
                are the certain Forms
                (if any such be to be found amongst
                them)
                which were
                accustomably
                used
                in those solemnities.
                For that some certain Forms
                there were,
                from which it was
                not lawful for the Priest to vary in the performance of
                his office, nor for the people to dissent when they
                made
                their Prayers,
                or brought
                their Offerings,
                is
                evident to any one that hath
                consulted
                with the Ancients;
                many of which shall be collected
                and presented
              
              
              
              in that which followeth.
                These they comprised
                together in a Book or Volume, which
                was
                committed
                to the Priests
                for their instruction  direction, to be
                made
                use of in their Sacrifices,
                or other parts
                of Worship, as occasion was.
                So witnesses
                <hi>Agellius</hi> plainly,
                or <hi>A. Gellius,</hi> if you will; for I dispute not of
                the name, so I have the man. <hi>Comprecationes

                are made
                to the immortal Gods,
                are all comprised
                in the Books
                belonging
                to the Priests
                of the people of <hi>Reme,</hi> and in most ancient
                Prayers
                (or Orations)
                which still remain upon record. And this I take to be
                an
                evidence above all exception; as to the <hi>quod sit</hi>
                of the point, that such Forms
                they had.
                And these I take it were
                the Books
                which <hi>Lactantius</hi> calls
                <hi>Pontificum ipsorum scripta;</hi>
              
              and to the which he doth refer his reader to be more
                throughly
                informed,
                <hi>de sacrificiis  mysteriis deorum,</hi>
                touching
                the mysteries
                or sacrifices
                of their several gods.
                Their Rituals
                we may rightly
                call them.
                For further proof whereof (if more proof be needful) I
                would fain know what else should be the
                meaning
                of those <hi>verba certa,  solennia,</hi> which do
                occur so often in the ancient writers
                of that people; in case they do not mean those set
                Forms
                or words,
                which both the Priests
                and People were
                to use, in Celebrating
                their accustomed
                Sacrifices,
                or other parts
                of publick
                worship. What else should be the
                meaning
                of these <hi>solennes
                preces</hi> which we find in <hi>Ovid. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de
                Fastis;</hi> of the <hi>solennem precem quindecim
                virorum,</hi> mentioned
                in <hi>Statius Papinius, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sylv.</hi> or of
                that of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian,
              
            </p>
            <q>
              <l>In vota superos voce solenni voca,</l>
              <l>Arasque dono thuris Eoi extrue?</l>
            </q>
            <p>
              No question, but in all those passages,
                the <hi>solennes
                preces,</hi>  <hi>solennis vox</hi> are to be
                understood
                of those Forms
                of prayer, which were
                prescribed
                unto the Priests,
                and by him
                dictated
                unto the people. In which regard, as they
                were
                sometimes
                called
                <hi>verba certa,</hi> so they are
                called
                other-whiles
                <hi>verba dictata.</hi> For thus the Poet <hi>Juvenal ---
                Dictata{que} verba praetulit, i. e.</hi> as the old
                <hi>Scholiast</hi> doth expound it,
              
              <hi>dictata  Sacerdote vel haruspice,</hi> such
                words
                as had
                been
                dictated
                by the <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Augur,</hi>
                according
                to the publick
                <hi>Ritual.</hi>
              
              And to this purpose that of <hi>Valerius Flaceus, Dictat
                pia vota sacerdos,</hi> the Priest
                did
                dictate to the party, the set words
                or Form, in which the Vow was
                to be conceived.
                And for the <hi>Verba certa,</hi> which before we
                spake
                of, they are no other than those
                words
                or Forms,
                which were
                prescribed
                in the performance of these publick
                offices.
                For thus saith
                <hi>Cicero,</hi> speaking
                of some of the Ancients
                Generals,
                who willingly
                had
                offered
                up their lives
                to preserve their Countrey;
                he tells
                us of them
                that they did
                <hi>seipsos diis immortalibus,
                velato capite, VERBIS CERTIS pro Repub. devovere.</hi>
              
              So <hi>Varro,</hi> the most famous
                Antiquary of the <hi>Latines,</hi>
                gives
                us this character or definition of their
                <hi>dies
                Fasti,</hi> that they were
                such, <hi>quibus</hi> certa verba <hi>legitima sine
                piaculo Praetoribus licet fari.</hi> And thus the old
                Grammarian <hi>Pompeius Festus,</hi>
                telling
                us what is
                meant
                by <hi>Minora Templa,</hi> saith
                that they are <hi>loca aliqua ab Auguribus VERBIS CERTIS
                definita,</hi> places
                laid
                out and limited
                by the <hi>Augurs</hi>
                under a certain Form of words,
                as in another place he tells
                us, that Temples
                are sometimes
                called
                <hi>Fana, a Fando;</hi> and gives
                this reason of the same, <hi>quod dum Pontifex dedicat
                CERTA VERBA fatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Temple being
                Consecrated,
              
              and the Priest in readiness, we must next go unto the
                Sacrifice, to look upon the Rites
                and set Forms
                of that. These we will borrow from <hi>Rosinus,</hi>
              
              who doth at large describe them
                in this wise, as followeth.
                <hi>Cum</hi> sacerdos <hi>victimam ad aram adduxisset,
                stans manu Aram prehendebat,  preces fundebat.
                Principium
                precationis </hi> Jano <hi>fieri oportehat, quae in omnibus sacris praecipua
                numina erant,  in votis nuncupandis compellationem
                primam meruerant; inde, quod per eos aditus ad caeteros
                patere opinio erat. Et observabatur in ea
                precatione
                nt</hi> Jupiter <hi>Pater Opt. Max.
                omnes{que}
                dii caeteri</hi> Patres <hi>advocarentur. Ne quid vero
                verborum praeteriretur, aut praepostere
                recitaretur,
                descripto</hi> praeire <hi>aliquem, ruisusque alium
                custodem dari, qui attenderet sedulo; alium qui
                favere</hi> linguis <hi>juberet  tibicinem canere, ne
                quid infaustum audiretur, oportebat.</hi> i. e.
              <q>
                when the Priest had
                  brought
                  the Sacrifice unto the Altar, he
                  stood
                  and held
                  the Altar in his hand, (or his hand rather upon it) and
                  made
                  the ordinary Prayers.
                  His Prayers
                  were
                  to begin with invocation of <hi>Janus</hi> and
                  <hi>Vesta,</hi> as having
                  the chief place in all their Sacrifices,
                  and being
                  usually
                  first called
                  upon in all their vows
                  and supplications,
                  on an
                  opinion that by them
                  the way was
                  made
                  more facile to the other Gods.
                  And 'twas observed
                  that in that Prayer, not only Father <hi>Jupiter</hi>
                  the best and greatest
                
                
                was
                  invoked
                  or called
                  upon, but also all the residue of the
                  greater
                  Deities.
                  And that there might no word be
                  pretermitted
                  or spoke
                  out of order, the custom was
                  that some did
                  first repeat the solemn words
                  as they were
                  described
                  in the <hi>Ritual,</hi> which were
                  said
                  after him
                  by the people present; others were
                  appointed
                  for overseers,
                  to attend the office; others there
                  were
                  who did
                  command the people Silence, and set the
                  Musician
                  to his singing,
                  lest any ominous or unlucky sound should be
                  heard
                  amongst them.
                  This in the way of preparation.
              </q>
              And all this as you see consisted
                in Prayers
                and Orizons
                unto the gods,
                that they would graciously
                accept the intended
                Sacrifice; and those not arbitrary, at the discretion of
                the Priest, but such as were
                prescribed
                and limited
                both for the method, and the manner. Which
                being
                written
                in a book (or Ritual as before I call'd it) the Priest
                did
                thence <hi>praeire verba,</hi> pronounce the usual and
                accustomed
                words,
                the people saying
                after him
                what he thence pronounced.
                And whereas it is
                said
                by <hi>Resnus</hi> here, that some of the
                attendants
                used
                to command the people silence, saying
                <hi>favete linguis,</hi> as we saw
                before; even those were
                words
                prescribed
                and limited,
                solemn and formal words
                in all publick
                Sacrifices.
                For thus we find it in the Poet <hi>Horace, Favete
                linguis, Carmina non prius audita, Musarum sacerdos
                virginibus puerisque canto;  Statius Papinius,</hi>
                thus, <hi>Lucanum canimus, favete linguis:</hi>
              
              And <hi>Servius</hi> on those words
                of <hi>Virgil, Ore favete omnes,  cingite
                temporaramis,</hi> makes
                this observation, <hi>Apto sermone
                usus est in sacrificiis  ludis. Nam in sacris
                taciturnitas necessaria est, quod etiam Praeco magistratu
                sacrificante dicebat, Favete linguis.</hi> The like we
                also have in <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his Book <hi>de beata
                vita ad Gallionem.</hi> But to proceed, as they
                made
                way unto their Sacrifices
                with certain and determinate Prayers
                to those several <hi>numina,</hi> to
                whom
                the service was
                intended,
                so when the Sacrifice was
                ended,
                and the Rites
                performed,
                they shut up all with Hymns
                and Praises,
                of which thus <hi>Rosinus. Ubi quod diis tributum esset
                conflagrasset, ad epulas ipsi  convivia
                convertebantur. Inter vescendum diis laudes canebant.</hi>
                i. e.
              
              <q>After the portion of the Sacrifice which
                was
                appropriated
                to the gods,
                was
                burnt, they all betook
                themselves to feast and banque;
                and in the middle of their meat,
                sang
                Hymns
                or Songs
                of praise unto their gods,
                and playing
                on their Cymbals
                danced
                about the Altars.</q>
              The reason of which last is
                thus given
                from <hi>Servius, ut nulla pars corporis sit quae non
                sentiret religionem,</hi> that there might be no part of
                the body without some sense of religious action, which
                was
                then in hand; the Songs
                relating
                to the mind or soul; the dancing
                to the motions
                of the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next for the Sacrifice it self, he
                describes
                it thus.
              
              
              <hi>His peractis, sacrum ab</hi>

                words
                <hi>Rosinus;</hi> the sense and substance of the which
                take from an
                Author of these times,
                as followeth,
              
              <q>
                The Priest or Sacrificer having
                  ended
                  his preparatory
                  Prayers,
                  he laid
                  upon the head of the Beast a little Corn, together with
                  a Cake made
                  of Meal and Salt, called
                  in Latine,
                  <hi>Mola.</hi> From this ceremony, the act of
                  Sacrificing
                  hath
                  been
                  called
                  <hi>Immolatio.</hi> After this he
                  drank
                  Wine out of an
                  earthen or wooden Chalice, called
                  in Latine
                  <hi>Simpulum</hi> or <hi>Simpuvium;</hi> which
                  afterwards
                  was
                  carried
                  unto all the people, that they might also
                  <hi>libare,</hi> which is,
                  lightly
                  taste thereof, which Rite was
                  therefore called
                  <hi>Libatio.</hi> Every one having
                  tasted
                  thereof, the rest of the Wine with Frankincense
                  mixt
                  in it, was
                  to be poured
                  on the Beasts
                
                
                
                head betwixt the horns;
                  and the Priest plucking
                  off some of the Beasts
                  hairs
                  which grew
                  between the horns,
                  did
                  cast them
                  into the fire, calling
                  them
                  his <hi>prima Libamina,</hi> or first
                  offerings.
                  Then turning
                  his face towards
                  the <hi>East,</hi> he drew
                  a long crooked
                  Knife from the forehead of the Beast unto his tail;
                  commanding
                  his inferiour
                  Ministers,
                  which from this Knife were
                  called
                  <hi>Cultrarii,</hi> and <hi>Victimarii,</hi> as also
                  <hi>Popae,</hi> and <hi>Agones,</hi> to kill the Beast.
                  And of the people standing
                  by, some did
                  with Vessels
                  save the blood, others did
                  flay or skin the Beast, and others
                  washed
                  it. Anon the Soothsayer, Priest, or Flamen
                  did
                  observe the intrails,
                  and turning
                  and winding
                  them
                  with a knife, which was
                  called
                  <hi>Secespita  secando;</hi> for he might not
                  touch them
                  with his hand, for fear lest some pollution might befall
                  the Sacrifice, and therewithal
                  his hand have perished.
                  Now after the Soothsayer or Priest
                  had
                  sufficiently
                  turned
                  the Intrails,
                  and found no ill token therein, then
                  did
                  those Ministers
                  or Underofficers
                  cut off from every bowl some part or portion, which
                  after they had
                  rouled
                  in Barley-meal, they presented
                  it in Baskets
                  to the Priests,
                  who laid
                  them
                  on the Altar, and there burnt them;
                  and this was
                  properly
                  termed
                  <hi>litare</hi> and <hi>reddere,</hi> i. e. to
                  satisfie
                  by Sacrifice, or to pay the Sacrifice which
                  had
                  been
                  owing
                  to the gods.
                  Add here, that for the fire with which they
                  used
                  to burn their Sacrifice, it was
                  not to be made
                  of the Olive-tree, nor of the Bay-tree, nor
                  an
                  Oak of a thicker bark, or which
                  was
                  of an
                  hollow or spungious body; these
                  trees
                  being
                  of an
                  ominous and suspected
                  quality.
              </q>
              
              And 'tis observable withal, <hi>Singulis diis victimas
                suas deputatas esse,</hi> that every god
                had
                his distinct and several sacrifice, both in kind and
                numbers,
                which are recited
                by <hi>Rosinus</hi> in the place aforesaid, and there may
                easily
                be found. It is
                enough that we have noted
                here those determinate Rites,
                those prescribed
                Forms
                and ceremonies,
                wherewith their Sacrifices
                were
                performed,
                that it may thereby be demonstrated
                how little (or indeed nothing in a manner)
                was
                left unto the Priests
                discretion, for Form or matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then perhaps it may be said,
              
              that this is
                to be understood
                of such Rites
                only, as wholly
                did
                consist in action; and that there might some liberty be
                left (notwithstanding
                this) in words
                and matter of expression. That therefore shall be
                looked
                on next; and being
                looked
                on, will be found to be as much
                prescribed
                and limited,
                as the other were.
                For first, it was
                the custom of the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                in the beginning
                of their Sacrifices,
                to use these words
                (and these words
                always)
                to the people, , <hi>i. e.</hi> who
                is
                here? to which the people did
                as constantly
                return this answer, ,
                many
                men
                and good.
              
              A proem very pertinent to the work in hand; the
                gods
                being
                thought of too great majesty, to be
                attended
                by a few, and sacrifice a work of too great piety, to be
                performed
                in the presence of a wicked person. In which regard as
                well the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                as the <hi>Romans</hi>
                did
                use a certain Form of words
                before they entred
                on their Sacrifices,
                whereby they warned
                all wicked and unholy persons
                not to come too near.
              
              The Form used
                by the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                was
                this, , be all profane far hence, from
                this holy business. And hereto <hi>Orpheus</hi> doth
                allude, when he would have the Temple
                doors
                shut against the wicked, lest they should enter in and
                profane the ceremony.
              
              ; which words
                of <hi>Orpheus</hi> are cited
                both by <hi>Justin M.</hi> and by <hi>Tatianus,</hi> two
                very ancient Christian
                writers,
                though by the fault of the Transcriber, instead of
                , which is
                the true and proper reading,
                we find there, . Which rather
                seems
                to keep the wicked and profane persons
                in the Temple,
              
              than to shut them
                out. Now that it was
                the shutting
                out of such, which is
                here intended,
                appeareth
                by that passage touching
                <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a famous Sophister, who
                having
                made
                an
                Hymn in the praise of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in the
                reciting
                of the same ()
                according
                to the usual Form, ,
              
              commanded
                all unholy and profane to avoid the room. And now I
                am
                fallen
                upon this Hymn to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> I shall add thus much,
                that in the Sacrifices
                made
                unto him,
                the Priests
                did
                thus bespeak the people, , <hi>Sing ye
                praise to God;</hi> and thereunto the people
                answered,
                . <hi>O Semeles fili,</hi>
              
              <hi>Iacche, largitor opum.</hi> But this
                is
                somewhat from the purpose, I return again; and in
                returning
                find the self same Form to have
                been
                used
                also by the <hi>Latines.
                Procul, O procul ite PROFANI, Conclamat vates, totoque
                absistite luco,</hi> as it is
                in <hi>Virgil,</hi> where he describes
                the Form of Sacrifice which was
                then in use much after that, which
                was
                collected
                from <hi>Rosinus.</hi> The like
                hath
                <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> on the like occasion,
              <q>
                <l>Tune puppe
                   media magno clamore Sacerdos,</l>

                <l>Et <hi>procul hinc,</hi> moneo, <hi>procul hinc</hi>

              </q>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
              The like hath
                <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> where
                speaking
                of <hi>Medea</hi> and her incantations,
                he thus brings
                it in:
              
              <q>
                <l>Hinc <hi>Procul</hi> Aesonidem, <hi>procul hinc</hi>
                  jubet ire ministros,</l>
                <l>Et monet arcanis oculos removere PROFANOS.</l>
              </q>
            </p>
            <p>
              In all which passages
                the Poets
                plainly
                do allude to the usual Forms
                wherewith the Priests
                began
                their Sacrifices.
                And yet for further proof thereof, lest
                possibly
                it may be thought that the aforesaid Form of
                words
                hath
                more of the Poet in it than of the Priest, we have
                <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking
                of those Rites
                and Ceremonies
                wherewith the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                did
                initiate or begin their Sacrifices,
                and therein using
                this expression, <hi>Cum semper impiae initiationes
                arceant PROFANOS.</hi>
              
              This Form, or if you will, those formal
                words,
                as they were
                constantly
                observed
                in the beginning
                of the Sacrifice, so were
                there others no less duly
                used
                in the very middle of the same. For when the Priest
                did
                pour the Wine upon the head of the Beast (whatsoever it
                was)
                which was
                intended
                for the Sacrifice, (and so he was
                to do, as was
                shewn
                before) he always
                used
                this Form of words,
                <hi>Mactus hoc vino inferio esto.</hi> And thus
                observed
                by <hi>Servius</hi> in his notes
                on <hi>Virgil,</hi>
              
              <hi>Quoties aut thus aut vinum super victimam fundebatur,
                dicebant,</hi> mactus est Taurus vino vel thure, <hi>hoc
                est, cumulata est hostia,</hi> i. e. <hi>magis aucta,</hi>
              
              Yet so that any times
                the Form did
                vary, according
                to the service of the god to whom
                the Sacrifice was
                offered.
                For if the Sacrifice were
                made
                to <hi>Janus,</hi> then the words
                ran
                thus, <hi>JANE Pater,</hi>
              
              <hi>uti te strue commovenda, bonas preces bene precatus
                sum, ejusdem
                rei ergo, Macte vino inferio esto:</hi> but if to
                <hi>Jupiter</hi> then thus, <hi>JUPITER Dapalis, macte
                istace dape pollucenda esto, macte vino inferio esto.</hi>
                Where note that howsoever there appear a difference in the
                first part of these two Forms,
                which were
                to be disposed
                and fitted
                according
                to the several occasions
                of the several Offerings;
                yet for the last clause, that which
                was
                said
                upon the pouring
                of the Wine on the head of the Sacrifice, there
                is
                no difference at all. And note withal, that the Wine here
                is
                called
                <hi>vinum inferium,</hi> either <hi>ab inferendo,</hi>
                because it was
                brought
                in for that end and purpose to be
                bestowed
                upon the gods;
              
              or else as <hi>Festus</hi> rather
                thinks,
                <hi>quod in sacrificando infra paterae labrum
                ponebatur,</hi> because that in the act of
                Sacrificing,
                it was
                placed
                within the lip or brim of the platter.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But not to spend more time (all that we have
                being
                too little for this following
                search) amongst our <hi>Criticks</hi>
                and <hi>Grammarians;</hi>
                from Forms
                of words
                though strictly
                both prescribed
                and practised,
                let us go on to Forms
                of Prayers.
                Where first, besides
                that made
                to <hi>Janus</hi> before remembred,
                we have another of that kind, and on that
                occasion,
                said
                usually
                <hi>in strue Jano commovenda</hi> (now <hi>strues</hi>
                was
                a kind of Cake which the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                offered
                to their Gods)
                and is
                this that followeth.
              
              <hi>JANE Pater, te hac strue commovenda bonas preces
                precor, uti sies volens propitius mihi, liberisque meis,
                domo, familiaeque
                meae.</hi> And besides
                that to <hi>Jupiter Dapalis,</hi> which we
                saw
                but lately,
                we have another of the same, made
                at the offering
                of a Cake also, which they called
                <hi>Fertum,</hi> thus, <hi>JUPITER te hoc ferto obmovendo
                bonas preces precor, uti sies volens propitius mihi,
                liberisque meis, domo, familiaeque meae;</hi>
              
              the very same, no more than the change of the
                oblation,
                as before to <hi>Janus.</hi> It
                seems
                that both these Prayers
                and Offerings
                were
                made
                unto the aforesaid gods,
                upon the coming
                in of Harvest, when they had
                gathered
                in their Corn, and satisfied
                themselves with the fruits
                thereof. For theh prosperity of which
                fruits,
                whilst they were
                yet growing,
                I find a very formal Prayer to be
                said
                to <hi>Mars,</hi> at such time as they
                made
                Procession to view their Fields,
                and pray unto the gods
                for their blessing
                on them.
                But why to <hi>Mars,</hi> more than to any other of the
                gods,
                that I cannot say; unless perhaps because he
                was
                the proper Deity of the <hi>Fratres arvales,</hi> a
                Colledge
                or fraternity of Priests
                so named,
                <hi>quod sacra publica faciunt, propterea ut fruges ferant
                arva,</hi> because they used
                to offer publick
                Sacrifice,
              
              that the earth might bring forth her increase. But
                whatsoever was
                the reason of it, I am
                sure that the Prayer was
                this, and 'tis the most compleat
                and perfect of any one that I have
                met
                with. <hi>MARS te precor quaesoque uti sies volens
                propitius mihi domo familiaeque nostrae. Cujus rei erge,
                agrum, terram, fundumque meum,</hi> Suovetaurilia (what
                they were,
                we shall see hereafter) <hi>circumagi jussi; uti tu morbos
                visos invisosque viduertam vastitudinemque, calamitates
                inteperiasque prohibisses, defendas, averruncesque uti in
                fruges, frumenta, vineta, virgultaque grandire, beneque
                evenire sinas, passores, pecuaque salva servasses; duisque
                bonam salutem, valetudinemque mihi, domo, fawiliaeque
                nostrae. Harumce rerum ergo,</hi>
              
              Macte hisce Suovetaurilibus esto. Which Prayer
                being
                very full and punctual, as you see it
                is,
                is
                thus contracted
                by <hi>Tibullus,</hi>
              <q>
                <l>Dii Patrii purgamus agros, purgamus agrestes;</l>
                <l>Vos mala de nostris pellite limitibus.</l>
              </q>
              
              
              
              And on the other side it is
                as much extended
                or drawn
                out in length by <hi>Ovid,</hi> in his Book <hi>de
                Fastis,</hi>
              
              where he describes
                the Feast which they called
                <hi>Palilia,</hi> and thither I refer the Reader. For
                other Prayers,
                but of a different kind, as of a different occasion from
                those before, take this of <hi>Psyche</hi> unto
                <hi>Juno;</hi> which though it be
                recorded
                in a fabulous story, is
                yet according
                to the Forms
                which were
                then in use, and is
                this now following.
              
              <hi>Magni JOVIS germana  conjuga, sive tu SAMI, quae
                querulo partu, vagitu{que}  alimonia tua gloriatur,
                tenes vetusta delubra; sive celsae</hi> Carthaginis,
                <hi>quae te virginem, vectura Leonis coelo commeantem,
                percolit, beatas sedes frequentas; sive prope ripas</hi>
                Inachi, <hi>quite jam nuptam Tonantis,  Reginam
                dearum memoras, inclytis Argivorum praesides
                moenibus;
                quam cunctus Oriens</hi> Zygiam <hi>appellat; sis meis
                extremis casibus JUNO sospita, me{que} in tantis
                exantlatis laboribus defessam, imminentis periculi metu
                libera; quod sciam soles
                periclitantibus subvenire.</hi> And
                finally,
                take this for a close of all, used
                at the Consecrating
                of a Grove for religious uses,
                at which they sacrificed
                a Swine or Porker with this solemn Form. <hi>Si deus, si
                dea es quorum illud sacrum est, uti tibi jus siet porco
                piaculo facere,</hi>
              
              <hi>illiusque sacri, coerandi ergo, sive Ego, sive quis
                jussu meo fecerit, uti id recte factum siet; ejus rei ergo
                te hoc</hi> Porco <hi>piaculo immolando bonas preces
                precor, uti sies volens propitius mihi, domo familiaeque
                meae, liberisque meis. Harumce rerum ergo,</hi> Macte hoc
                porco piaculo
                immolando <hi>esto.</hi> More of these
                instances
                might be produced,
                were
                not these sufficient, to shew
                that even the Gentiles
                were
                no strangers
                to set Forms
                of Prayer; whether we look upon
                them
                in their solemn Sacrifices,
                or their occasional devotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now as they used
                set Forms
                of Prayer when they applyed
                themselves unto the gods,
              
              for the obtaining
                of their favours;
                so did
                they tye
                themselves to prescribed
                Forms,
                either of Invocation or of Adjuration, when they
                intended
                to devote themselves to some sudden death, for
                preservation of their Country; or
                practised
                to entice the gods
                of other Nations,
                to leave their former dwellings,
                and repair to them.
                This last, a thing much used
                amongst them
                in those times
                of darkness, on a conceit, that there
                was
                little hope to subdue those people against
                whom
                they had
                waged
                wars,
                or to be Masters
                of that City, State or Country, whose conquest they
                had
                undertaken;
                till the said
                People, City, State, or Countrey
                should be forsaken
                of their gods.
                This made
                the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                endeavour
                with such care and cunning, to get into their
                hands
                the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> called
                the <hi>Palladium;</hi>
              
              being
                well assured
                in their own opinion, that <hi>Troy</hi> could never be
                surprized
                or forced,
                till they were
                masters
                of that piece. And to this <hi>Virgil</hi> doth allude,
                where he complaineth
                that the gods
                had
                forsook
                their Altars,
                and dwelt
                no longer
                in their <hi>Adyta,</hi> the most
                retired
                and inward part of all their Temples,
                as before was
                shewn.
              
              <hi>Excessere omnes</hi> Adytis <hi>arisque relictis Dii
                quibus imperium hoc steterat,</hi> as the Poet
                hath
                it. Upon which place it is
                observed
                by <hi>Servius</hi> briefly,
                <hi>ante expugnationem,</hi> evocari
                <hi>ab hostibus numina, propter evitanda sacrilegia;</hi>
                which is
                the same in substance with that before. But for a
                larger
                and more full description both of the thing it self, and
                the reason of it, take this of <hi>Ludovicus Vives; Cum
                oppugnabantur civitates, eratque in animo Imperatoribus
                eas demoliri, ne contra deos bellum geri videretur, iique
                suis sedibus moveri
                inviti, quod nefas erat,</hi> evocabantur <hi>ex obsessa
                civitate ab Imperatore obsidente, ut in
                urbem victricem
                volentes migrarent.</hi>
              
              And this, saith
                he, did
                <hi>Camillus</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Veii, Scipio</hi> at
                the subversion of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
                <hi>Numantia,</hi> and <hi>Mummius</hi> at the destruction
                of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Now for the Form or
                prescribed
                words
                of Evocation, which were
                used
                herein, they
                were
                these that follow, as they were
                used
                by <hi>Scipio</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Carthage. Si deus,
                si dea est, cui populus civitasque</hi> Carthaginiensis
                <hi>est tutela, Teque maxime ille qui urbis bujus
                populique tutelam recepisti, precor venerorque veniamque
                 vobis peto, ut vos populum,
                civitatem</hi> Carthaginiensem <hi>deseratis, loca,
                Templa, sacra, urbemque eorum relinquatis,
                absque his abeatis, eique populo, civitati metum,
                formidinem, oblivionem injiciatis, proditique</hi> Romam
                <hi>ad me, meosque veniatis, nostraeque</hi> urbis
                <hi>loca, templa, sacra, urbs acceptior
                probatiorque
                sit, mihique populoque</hi> Romano <hi>militibusque meis
                praepositi sitis, ut sciamus intelligamusque.
                Si ita feceritis,</hi>
              
              <hi>voveo vobis Templa ludosque facturum.</hi>
                Shorter
                was
                this, but to the same effect and purpose,
                used
                by <hi>Camillus</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Veii,</hi> when
                he enticed
                Queen <hi>Juno</hi> to desert the place. <hi>Te simul JUNO
                Regina, quae nunc</hi> Veios <hi>colis, precor, ut nos
                victores in nostram tuamque mox futuram urbem sequare; ubi
                te dignum amplitudine tua Templum accipiat.</hi>
              
              It seems
                the Form increased
                both in words
                and circumstance, according
                to the growth and puissance of the <hi>Roman</hi> State,
                which was
                far greater
                in the time of <hi>Scipio,</hi> than when
                <hi>Camillus</hi> governed
                the affairs
                of <hi>Rome.</hi> Put all together, and you will think the
                <hi>Tyrians</hi>
                had
                good reason for what they did,
                (the dotage of the times
                considered)
                when having
                <hi>Apollo</hi> in suspicion that he
                meant
                to leave them,
                or
              
              
              possibly
                might be thus inticed
                from them,
                they fastned
                him
                unto their Altars
                with a massie
                chain, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth relate the story.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus also when some zealous Patriot
                had
                a purpose to devote himself unto sudden and unavoidable
                destruction,
              
              for preservation of his Countrey
                from some imminent ruine;
                they did
                it not without a certain Form of
                words,
                dictated
                to them
                by the Priest, who attended
                on them
                for the promotion of that service. That so they
                did,
                we have examples
                many in the stories
                both of <hi>Greeks</hi>
                and <hi>Romans;</hi>
                amongst which, that of <hi>Codrus</hi> the
                <hi>Athenian</hi> King, and <hi>Decius</hi> the
                <hi>Roman</hi> General, are of most antiquity.
              
              And for the Form in which they did
                it, we have it thus laid
                down in that of <hi>Decius,</hi> when in a war against the
                <hi>Latines,</hi>
                the <hi>Romans</hi>
                beginning
                to give ground, he said
                aloud unto theh Priest or Pontifex, who
                did
                attend upon the Army, <hi>Poutifex</hi> praei verba,
                <hi>quibus me pro legionibus devoveam,</hi> that they
                should dictate to him
                the accustomed
                words,
                in which he was
                to dedicate or devote himself unto the
                gods,
                for theh preservation of the Legions.
                This said,
                the Priest appointed
                him
                to put on his Gown (which they called
                <hi>toga praetexta</hi>) and with
                an
                hood upon his head, and his hand
                raised
                up unto his chin, to stand upon a Dart or Weapon, and to
                say as followeth,
                <hi>Jane, Jupiter, Mars pater, Quirine, Bellona, Lares,
                Divi Novensiles, Dii indigetes, Divi quorum est protestas
                nostrorum hostiumque, Diique manes,
                vos precor, veneror, veniam peto feroque uti populo Romano
                Quiritium
                vim victoriamque prosperetis; hostesque populi</hi> Romani
                Quiritium <hi>terrore, formidineque
                morteque afficiatis. Sicut verbis nuncupavi, ita pro
                Republica</hi> Quiritium, <hi>Diis
                manibus
                Tellurique DEVOVE.</hi> Which said
                he furiously
                cast himself into the middle of the
                Enemies,
                as if he had
                been
                sent
                by the gods
                of purpose,
              
              <hi>qui pestem ab suis aversam in
                hostes
                ferret,</hi> to carry all their anger with
                him
                to the adverse party. And that this
                was
                the solemn Form used
                constantly
                on those occasions,
                appears
                not only by the words
                of <hi>Decius</hi> to the Priest or <hi>Pontifex,</hi>
                before remembred,
                but also by the following
                practice; the self same Form, <hi>quo pater DECIUS bello
                Latino se jusserat DEVOVERI,</hi>
              
              being
                used
                after by the younger
                <hi>Decius,</hi> on the like occasion, in a War against
                the <hi>Gauls</hi>
                and <hi>Samnites.</hi>
                Such also was
                the solemn Form which the <hi>Romans</hi>
                used
                when they devoted
                any of their Enemies,
                their Camps
                and Cities
                to the same perdition. A copy or record
                wherof
                is
                still remaining
                in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> from whom
                take it thus. <hi>Dis Paters,</hi>
              
              <hi>sive Jovis Manes,
                sive quo alio nomine fas est nominare, ut omnes illam
                urbem</hi> Carthaginem, <hi>exercitumque
                quem ego me sentio dicere, fuga, formidine, terrore
                compleatis, quique adversus legiones
                exercitumque nostrum arma telaque ferent, uti vos eos
                exercitus, eos hostes,
                eosque homines,

                regionibusque agris urbibusque habitant, abducatis, lumine
                supero privetis; exercitusque hostium, urbes agrosque
                eorum quos me sentio dicere, uti vos eas urbes agrosque
                capita aetatesque eorum DEVOTAS consecratasque habeatis,
                illis legibus, quibus quandoque sunt maxime
                hostes</hi>
                devoti; <hi>eosque ego Vicorios pro me, fide,
                magistratuque meo,  pro populo</hi> Romano,
                <hi>exercitibus Legionibusque nostris</hi> devoveo; <hi>ut
                me, meamque fidem, imperiumque Legiones exercitumque
                nostrum, qui in his rebus gerundis sunt, bene salvos
                sinatis esse. Si haec ita faxitis, ut ego scidm, sentiam,
                intelligamque tunc quisquis votum hoc faxit, ubi faxit,
                recte facium esto, ovibus atris tribus, Tellus mater,
                teque Jupiter obtestor.</hi> In the performance of which
                part of their devotions,
                it is
                observed
                by my Author, that when the party, whosoever he
                was,
                named
                the Earth, or <hi>Tellus,</hi> he
                stooped
                unto the ground and touched
                it; when he named
                <hi>Jove,</hi> he lift his hands
                up to the Heavens;
                and when he came
                to the devoting
                of the place or people, he layed
                them
                then upon his breast. Sufficient evidence, that not alone
                the Forms,
                but their very gestures
                were
                prescribed
                and regulated.
            </p>
            <p>
              For further proof whereof (of the last I mean) if we
                consult the <hi>Latine</hi>
                Authors
                of best rank and credit,
              
              it will soon be found that there
                was
                little in the point of gesture left at liberty; but almost
                every circumstance in the Act of Worship,
                determined
                and appointed
                to their hands;
                the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                generally
                making
                their Prayers
                upon their knees,
                their hands
                stretched
                unto the Heavens,
                their faces
                looking
                towards
                the East, and their heads
                uncovered.
                These are the most considerable
                passages
                in the Act of Worship; and these we shall run over
                briefly.
                First that they prayed
                upon their knees,
                and more than so, lay prostrate
                sometimes
                on the earth in the act of Worship,
                is
                evident by
                several testimonies,
                both of their own Writers
                and of the Christian. For <hi>Ovid</hi>
                tells
                us of the <hi>Roman</hi> Matrons
                that <hi>genibus nixas dees orasse,</hi> that they
                kneeled
                on their knees
                when they made
                their Prayers;
                the like saith
                <hi>Livie</hi>
                also, whereof more anon;
              
              and <hi>Apuleius</hi> brings
                in <hi>Psyche</hi> falling
                on her knees,
                when she poured
                forth her Prayers
                to <hi>Juno.</hi> Thus <hi>Ovid</hi>
                tells
                us also of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha,</hi>
              
              that when they came
                unto the
              
              
              
              Temple,
              
              <hi>Procumbit uter{que} pronus bumi,</hi> they both fell
                prostrate on the earth. And so <hi>Tibullus</hi> of
                himself, that he would never stick at that, <hi>viz.</hi>
                to fall down prostrate, yea, to kiss the pavement.
            </p>
            <q>
              <l>Non ego, si merui,
                dubitem <hi>procumbere</hi> Templis,</l>
              <l>
                Et dare sacratis <hi>oscula</hi> limitibus.
                
              </l>
            </q>
            <p>
              More of this kind might be added
                here, were
                not these sufficient. And for the
                Christian
                writers,
                they observe it also: <hi>Arnobius</hi>
                noting
                of the Gentiles,
                <hi>deorum ante ora prostratos esse,</hi> that they fell
                prostrate when they came
                before their gods;
                <hi>limina ipsa osculis converrentes,</hi>
              
              and did
                even sweep the pavement with their
                kisses.
                And <hi>Prudentius</hi> also tells
                us of them,
                <hi>genua incurvare Dianae,  plantis Herculis
                alvolvi,</hi> that they did
                bow the knee before <hi>Diana,</hi> and cast themselves
                down at the feet
                of <hi>Hercules.</hi> 'Tis true, they
                used
                to sit sometimes
                when as the Priest was
                at the sacrifice, and presently
                assoon as their Prayers
                were
                ended:
                But then it is
                as true withal, that by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> their
                irreverence therein is
                much condemned,
              
              who could not patiently
                endure it, and therefore sheweth
                how much he did
                dislike that irreverent gesture. For which
                consult
                him
                in his Book <hi>de Oratione,</hi>

                up of the hands
                to Heaven,

                that Poet; hardly
                one book in all the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> in which that
                posture is
                not spoke
                of. In <hi>Ovid</hi> it is

              Thus <hi>Livie</hi>
                tells
                us of the matrons
                before remembred,
                <hi>nixas genibus, supinas manus ad caelum ac deos
                tendere,</hi>
              
              that being
                on their knees,
                they lifted
                up their hands
                unto the Heavens,
                and so made
                their prayers.

              More of this we need not. And much there
                needs
                not to demonstrate, that they turned
                their faces
                towards
                the <hi>East,</hi> in the solemnity of their
                devotions;
                the point being
                made
                so universally
                apparent, by this note of <hi>Servius.</hi> For whereas it
                is
                said
                by <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the description of a sacrifice,
              <q>

              The old <hi>Grammarian</hi> would not have you think that
                this was
                spoken
                of the Sun-rising
                <hi>Jam dudum enim dies
                erat,</hi>
              
              For it had
                long before been
                day. NOt so, saith
                he, <hi>Sed disciplinam ceremoniarum secutus est, ut</hi>
                orientem <hi>diceret spectare eum, qui precaturus
                offerat;</hi> He only doth observe the ancient discipline
                and ceremonies,
                that he who was
                to pray, should look toward the <hi>East.</hi> And this
                may also be collected
                from the contrivance of their Temples,
                which were
                so fashioned,
                as the great Architect <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
                noteth,
                <hi>ut qui adierint ad aram immolantes,</hi>
              
              <hi>ant sacrificia facientes, spectent ad partem coeli
                Orientem,</hi> that they who offered
                sacrifice, or made
                their prayers
                (for so it followeth
                in the next words)
                might look towards
                the <hi>East.</hi> Finally,
                for the uncovering
                of the head in the Act of Worship, it
                was
                used
                generally
                by the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                both in their Sacrifices
                and their Prayers,
              
              and is
                therefore called
                <hi>Graecus ritus,</hi> in <hi>Macrobius:</hi> And by the
                <hi>Romans</hi>
                also in the Prayers
                and Sacrifices
                made
                unto <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> whereof
                consult <hi>Macrob.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.  10.
                and <hi>Dionysius Halicarnass. hist. Rom. lib.</hi> 1. as
                also in all acts
                of worship whatsoever, performed
                at that great and ancient Altar,
                called
                <hi>Ara Maxima,</hi> of old erected
                by the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
              
              before the coming
                of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> with his
                <hi>Trojan</hi> ceremonies.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
              And now I am
                fallen
                upon the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                and their gestures
                in the Act of Worship, I will lay down the form and
                ceremonies,
                in which their Sacrifices,
                which were
                their greatest
                Acts
                of Worship, were
                performed
                and celebrated.
                Of these I had
                intended
                to say nothing here, partly because the punctual practice
                of the <hi>Romans</hi>
                would give sufficient light and evidence unto the business
                now in hand; but principally
                because the Estates
                of <hi>Greece</hi> being
                very many, and those too absolute and independent, I
                doubted
                I should find but small agreement in their
                Rites
                and Forms.
                But finding
                a set Form of Sacrifice used
                by those of <hi>Athens,</hi> painfully
                collected
                to my hand by Mr. <hi>Francis Rous</hi> of <hi>Oxon,</hi>
                in his three books
                of the <hi>Athenian Antiquities;</hi>
              
              in honour of his learned
                industry, I will here present it,
                leaving
                the Allegations
                and Authorities
                to be consulted
                in the Authors
                margin. Thus then saith
                he, <hi>The Priests
                being
                purified
                and prepared,
                they came
                and stood
                round the Altar, having
                with them
                a Basket, in which was
                the Knife hid,
                (covered
                with flower and salt) wherewith they cut the throat of the
                Victim. Then they purified
                the Altar, going
                about it with the right hand towards
                it; which lustration was
                made
                with Meal and Holy-water sprinkled
                thereon. This water is
                called
                , in which they
                quenched
                a Fire-brand taken
                from the Altar, with which they
                bedewed
                the standers
                by, accounting
                it a cleansing;
                from whence 
                was
                forbidden
                him,
                whom
                they took
                for a forlorn and polluted
                wretch. Then they cast some of the flour on
                them.
                And having
                thus expiated,
                they cryed
                out,</hi> ; who
                is
                here? <hi>to which they made
                reply,</hi> ,
                many and good.
                <hi>Then they prayed,
                speaking
                with a loud voice before they began,</hi>
                , i. e. Let us pray.
                <hi>Supplications
                being
                ended,
                they drew
                the Victim so, as, if it were
                to the gods
                above, the head might look upwards;
                if it were
                to the Heroes
                or Demy-gods,
                with his throat downwards.
                Then they slew
                him
                and skinned
                him,
                and cutting
                out thehuck, shinbones
                and banch, they covered
                them
                with fat, which is
                called</hi>
                , <hi>(whence the
                gods
                of the Heathen are said
                by</hi> Nazianzen, , <hi>to
                rejoyce
                in the fat) to the end that they may burn all out in a
                great flame. For the</hi> Grecians
                <hi>accounted
                it unlucky, if it did
                not so consume, and thought that it
                was
                not</hi> . Upon the
                 <hi>they cast small
                pieces
                of flesh cut from every part of the beast,
                beginning
                with the shoulder (which in</hi> Greek
                <hi>is</hi>
                ) <hi>from whence this action
                is
                called</hi>
                . <hi>The reason</hi> Eustathius
                <hi>gives,</hi>
                , c. <hi>that they might seem to
                consume all, which the</hi> Athenians
                <hi>did
                not, being
                commanded
                by Law to carry some of the Sacrifice home. By reason of
                which injunction they did
                so strain courtesie
                with their gods,
                that the illiberal or niggardly sort of people, would sell
                that which was
                left, and so make a gain of their devotion. That which
                they offered
                was
                the haunch-bone, or the entrails,
                or somewhat of no great worth; where by
                entrails
                you must understand the spleen, the liver, and the heart,
                which</hi> Homer <hi>calleth</hi>
                . <hi>These the
                ancients
                did
                divide amongst them
                at Sacrifice to feed on, and afterwards
                cut out the rest to roast; for when they
                had
                finished
                their devotions,
                they let loose the reins
                to all voluptuousness. For many
                times
                they left nothing
                of their Sacrifice, especially
                when they offered
                unto</hi> VEsta; <hi>whence the Proverb</hi>
                , <hi>to Sacrifice to</hi> Vesta,
                <hi>is
                to eatup all.</hi> He also notes
                from <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> that they
                had
                their Meat-offerings,
                and their Drink-offerings;
                that in their Meat-offerings,
                it was
                required
                that it should be sound and without blemish, whether it
                were
                an
                Ox, Sheep, Goat, Swine, or Calf; that he whose poverty
                was
                such that he could not afford a Sheep, or the like, might
                with acceptance to the Gods,
                offer a little Cake or Mola, which by the
                richer
                sort was
                mingled
                with Oyl
                and Wine; and finally,
                that instead of this, the wealthier
                sort used
                to cast frankincense upon the Altar. Such
                were
                the prescribed
                Rites
                and Forms,
                in which the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                offered
                Sacrifice to the gods
                of <hi>Attica:</hi> And doubt we not but that the other
                States
                of <hi>Greece,</hi> as they had
                gods
                to whom
                to Sacrifice, and Sacrifices
                for their gods;
                so were
                they also regulated
                by a prescript Form, in which their
                gods
                were
                to be Worshipped,
                their Sacrifices
                to be tendred.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to return again to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                Forms,
                to put an
                end to this discourse,
              
              we will a little look on their Forms
                of Marriage, so far forth and no further, as they
                did
                relate to religious Worship and Invocation of their
                gods.
                For though they made
                no care nor conscience in breaking
                of the Bond of Marriage upon all
                occasions,
                yet did
                they seldom make a Marriage to which the
                gods
                were
                not invited,
                or not called
                upon. For anciently
                there was
                no making
                of a Marriage wherein the Soothsayers,
                or Auspex was
                not consulted.
                This <hi>Servius</hi> hath
                observed
                in his notes
                on <hi>Virgil,</hi>
              
              <hi>Romani nihil nisi captatis faciebant auguriis,
                praecipue NUPTIAS,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi>
                did
                not any thing (saith
                he) without consulting
                with the <hi>Augur,</hi> especially
                in point of Marriage. In celebrating
                of the which, as there were
                certain formal words,
                so were
                there also solemn Sacrifices.
                First, for the formal words
                of Marriage, <hi>Boetius</hi> doth report
                them
                thus. <hi>Coemptio certis
              
              
              
              solennitatibus peragebatur,  sese in coemendo invicem
                interrogabant, Vir</hi> ita, <hi>an
                sibi mulier materfamilias esse vellet, illa respondebat
                velle: item Mulier interrogabat,
                an
                sibi vir Paterfamilias esse vellet, ille respondebat
                velle,</hi> c. That kind of Marriage
                (saith
                he) which is
                called
                <hi>Coemption,</hi>
              
              was
                done
                with certain and determinate solemnities,
                proposing
                to each other these Interrogatories.
                The Man demanded
                of the Woman, if <hi>she would be his
                Wedded
                Wife,</hi> and she said,
                <hi>I will:</hi> And then the Woman
                asked
                the Man, if <hi>he would be her
                Wedded
                Husband,</hi> and he said,
                <hi>he would;</hi> which said,
                the Man took
                the Woman into his hands,
                and from thenceforth she was
                his Wife. Next for the solemn Sacrifice
                performed
                at Weddings,
                there was
                a Form of Marriage which they called
                <hi>Confarreatio,</hi> because the
                Married
                couple used
                to eat of a Barley cake, which had
                been
                offered
                in the Sacrifice: From whence perhaps the use of Bride
                cakes
                came
                first into this Countrey
                with the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                as many other of their customs
                did.
                And this was
                Solemnized
                saith
                the great Lawyer <hi>Ulpian,</hi>
              
              <hi>Certis verbis,  testibus decem
                praesentibus,
                 solenni sacrificio facto, in quo
                panis
                farreus adhibetur,</hi> under a certain and
                prescribed
                Form of words,
                ten Witnesses
                at the least being
                present, and a solemn Sacrifice,
                wherein the Barley-cake was
                used,
                which before we spake
                of. The Beast prepared
                for the Sacrifice,
              
              was
                commonly
                a Swine or Porker, as it is
                in <hi>Varro.</hi> And if a Sacrifice
                were
                offered,
                as it seems
                to be, no question but it was
                attended
                with Prayers
                and Orizons
                unto the gods,
                for the prosperity of the parties.
                This affirmed
                plainly
                by <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi> in his <hi>Argonautica.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
              <l>Inde ubi sacrificas cum conjuge venit ad aras</l>
              <l><hi>Aesonides,</hi> unaque adeunt, pariterque precari
                Incipiunt, <hi>c.</hi></l>
            </q>
            <p>
              Finally,
              
              besides
                the laying
                down of money at the time of Marriage, in the way of
                dowry, from whence it seemeth
                to be called
                <hi>Coemption;</hi> the Bridegroom
                used
                to put a Ring on the fourth finger of his Spouse, when he
                made
                the Contract. The thing affirmed
                by <hi>Juvenal</hi> amongst the
                Ancients,
              
              where speaking
                of a Contract or Espousal, he thus
                glanceth
                at it, <hi>Jamque  tonsore magistro Pectoris,
                 digitis pignus fortasse dedisti.</hi> The reason of
                it given
                by <hi>Gellius,</hi>
              
              and since him
                by others, because it was
                observed
                by the <hi>Auatomists, repertum esse nervum quendam
                tenuissimum ab eo uno digito ad Cor hominis pergere ac
                pervenire,</hi> That from that finger there
                passEd
                a small and slender nerve to the heart of man. More of
                this we may see hereafter, when we are come unto the Form
                of Marriage in the Christian Church; to the determinate
                Forms
                whereof we are come at last.

            <p>
              THus have we taken
                a distinct and several view of those
                Forms
                of Worship,
              
              which anciently
                were
                used
                by the <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                whilst they stood
                divided;
                whilst they were
                separated
                by that partition-wall which the Apostle
                speaks
                of, whereby they were
                indeed divided
                both in opinions
                and affections.
                But that partition-wall being
                broken
                down by our Lord and Saviour,
              
              he did
                withal <hi>abolish in his flesh that enmity</hi> which
                had
                been
                between them,
                even the <hi>Law of Commandments
                contained
                in Ordinances,
                for to make in himself of twain one new man; so
                making
                peace</hi> between the parties,
                <hi>ut reconciliaret
                ambos in unto corpore, that he might reconcile both to
                God, being
                united
                in one body by the Cross of Christ.</hi> And indeed how
                could he do otherwise, who was
                as well designed
                by Almighty God, to be a <hi>light to lighten the</hi>
                Gentiles,
                as to <hi>be the glory of his People</hi> Israel?
              
              The promise which God made
                to <hi>Abraham</hi> was
                not unto his Seed alone, but to all the
                Nations
                of the World by it: And although <hi>Shiloh</hi>
                was
                to come from the loins
                of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet was
                he also <hi>expectatio Gentium,</hi> as the Vulgar
                reads
                it,
              
              and <hi>to him
                should the gathering
                of the People be.</hi> Therefore however he
                was
                pleased
                to declare at first, that he was
                <hi>tnot sent
                but to the lost
                Sheep of the House of</hi> Israel,
              
              and did
                accordingly
                grant out a limited
                Commission unto his Disciples;
                yet he enlarged
                it in the end,
              
              giving
                them
                an
                especial
                charge to <hi>go teach all Nations.</hi>
              
              And when he found them
                backward in pursuit thereof, he
                quickned
                <hi>Peter</hi> by a Vision, and
                called
                <hi>Paul</hi> as it were
                of purpose,
              
              <hi>to bear his name before the</hi>
                Gentiles,
                <hi>to open their eyes,
                and to turn them
                from darkness unto light,</hi>
              
              <hi>and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> So that
                although the <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                were
                not collected
                into one body, in our Saviours
                time,
              
              I mean the time in which he pleased
                to sojourn here upon the Earth: yet
                being
                done
                by his Authority, and by the conduct
                and direction of his blessed
                Spirit, it can be said
                of none but him,
                <hi>quod fecit utra{que} unum,</hi> that <hi>he
                made
                both one,</hi> bringing
                them
                both into one Church,
              
              and making
                both partakers
                of the same communion, who were
                before at such a distance, as was
                conceived
                to be irreconcilable. Unto the constituting
                of which Church, our Saviour brought
                not any thing of Rite or Ceremony,
                determined
                nothing that we meet with in his holy
                Gospels,
                touching
                the time or place of publick
                Worship, the Form and manner of the same; save that he
                gave
                a general intimation, that <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                should no longer
                be the place, in which men
                should be bound
                to Worship.
              
              The pains
                he took
                were
                principally
                spent
                in points
                of Doctrin,
                clearing
                the truths
                of holy Scripture from those false
                glosses
                and corrupt traditions,
                which had
                been
                put upon it by the <hi>Scribes</hi>
                and <hi>Pharisees;</hi>
                and setting
                forth a new and clearer
                body of Divinity than had
                been
                taught
                the people in the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi>
                that the Father might be worshipped
                in succeeding
                times
                with a greater
                measure of the spirit, and a more perfect knowledge of the
                truth,
              
              than he had
                been
                formerly.
                As for the circumstances
                and out-parts
                of Worship, he left them
                in the state he found them,
                that is
                to say, to the disposing
                of the Church, in whose power it
                was
                to institute such Rites
                and Ceremonies
                as might apparently
                conduce to the increase of Piety, and to the
                setting
                forth of Gods
                praise and glory. Himself had
                given
                a personal and most exemplary obedience to the Church of
                <hi>Jewry,</hi> conforming
                to such Rites
                and Ordinances
                (wherein there was
                no deviation from the Law of God) as
                had
                in former times
                been
                setled
                by the power thereof. And therefore
                had
                no cause of his collecting;
                a Church conducted
                in those points
                which pertain to godliness, by such a visible co-operation
                of the Holy Ghost; especially
                considering
                what a fair example
                of Conformity he should leave behind
                him.
                Besides
                all people of the world, both <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                were
                setled
                at that time in a full perswasion
                of the necessity of set times
                and determinate places,
                for the assembling
                of themselves together in the acts
                of Worship; and had
                their prescribed
                Forms
                both of Prayer and Praise, their
                Rituals
                and established
                Ceremonies;
                and therewith also an
                opinion that those things
                were
                to be eprformed by the Priest alone. Which
                being
                agreed
                on in the general, both people might be
                brought
                with more facility, to fall on some particular
                conclusions,
                to which they were
                inclined
                already by their common principles.
                And so indeed it proved
                in a short event; times,
                places,
                and set Forms
                for worship, being
                unanimously
                and universally
                received
                amongst them,
                within a very little while after our
                Lords
                departure. The <hi>Jews</hi>
                already had
                their Synagogues,
                their <hi>Proseuchas</hi> or <hi>Oratories,</hi>
                as before was
                said.
                How small a labour was
                it to the blessed
                Apostles,
                and their successors
                in that work, to turn those Synagogues
                of theirs into Christian Churches,
                for Preaching
                of the Word of God, and the administration of the
                Sacraments;
                accordingly
                as they did
                win upon the <hi>Jews</hi>
                to embrace the Gospel? Nor is
                this only a bare speculation, it
              
              
              
              was
                done
                <hi>de facto,</hi> it being
                recorded
                in a book ascribed
                unto <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that on the
                converting
                of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                Inhabitants
                of <hi>Beritus,</hi> to the faith of Christ,
                ,
              
              that the Bishop who had
                laboured
                in it, converted
                the Synagogue of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                into a <hi>Christian</hi> Church, and
                dedicated
                it to our Lord and Saviour. And for the
                Temples
                of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                when once their superstitions
                were
                suppressed,
                and the Gospel countenanced
                by Authority, they were
                converted
                also to the self-same use,
              
              as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogues
                had
                been
                in other places:
                Gods
                Servants
                being
                in the mean time contented
                with such safe retreats,
                as their necessities
                inforced
                them
                to make use of in those fiery times;
                or with such publick
                places
                of Assembly,
                but mean and under the degree of envy, as either upon
                sufferance or by special leave they
                were
                permitted
                to erect. As soon, if not more suddenly,
                all parties
                also were
                agreed
                on the times
                of worship, which was
                reduced
                with general and joynt
                consent unto the first day of the week, the
                Lords
                day, or the <hi>Sunday,</hi> call it which you will;
                wherein all members
                of the Congregation were
                to meet together for Gods
                publick
                Service. A business, wherein the Church
                proceeded
                with great care and wisdom; setting
                apart one day in seven, to hold the
                fairer
                quarter with the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                who were
                so zealous of a <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but
                altering
                the day it self, and paring
                off those legal Ordinances
                which had
                made
                it burdensome, the better to content the
                <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                Yet so that they had
                also their daily meetings
                as occasion served,
                for celebration of the Sacrament of the
                blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in those fiery
                times.
                Whereof, as being
                instituted
                for the <hi>Christian</hi> Sacrifice, and of the
                <hi>Evangelical</hi> Priesthood to attend the same, we
                shall speak anon.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mean time,
              
              the next thing here to be considered,
                is
                the form and order wherein the Church
                did
                celebrate Gods
                publick
                Service in those purer
                times;
                those Forms
                of Prayer and Invocation, wherewith they
                did
                address themselves to the Lord their God. That all
                Religious offices
                in the House of God should be performed
                in form and order,
              
              is
                not only warranted,
                but enjoyned
                by the Apostles
                Canon, made
                for those of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and
                consequently
                for all Churches
                else. And that for the avoiding
                of <hi>Battologies,</hi>
                and all effusions
                of raw and undigested prayers,
                besides
                what hath
                been
                shewn
                before to have been
                generally
                in use both with <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> in
                being
                bound
                and regulated
                by set Forms
                of Prayer: We have a Form laid
                down by our Lord and Saviour, both for our use and
                imitation. And first, that it was
                made
                for our imitation is
                generally
                agreed
                on, even by those, who otherwise approve not set
                Forms
                of Prayer.
              
              <hi>Calvin</hi> doth so resolve it,
                saying,
                <hi>In hunc finem tradita est haec
                regula, ad
                quam preces nostras exigere necesse est, si legitimas
                censeri Deoque probari cupimus.</hi> And in the
                words
                not long before, <hi>Non jubet Christus suos conceptis
                verbis orare, sed tantum
                ostendit quorsum vota omnia precesque referri deceat.</hi>
                The meaning
                in both passages
                is
                no more than this, that Christ obliged
                not his Disciples
                to the very words,
                but only shewed
                them
                how they were
                to pray, and what to pray for, if they would order
                them
                aright, and did
                desire to have them
                acceptable in the sight of God. To this doth
                <hi>Musculus</hi> agree, besides
                many others, whom
                here indeed I had
                not named,
                but that he doth translate the Text in a different manner,
                from all the rest which I have met
                with. For whereas <hi>Beza, Calvin, Erasmus, Castalio,
                Paraeus,</hi> and indeed who not, do read it <hi>sic
                orate,</hi> as the Vulgar doth: <hi>Musculus,</hi> to
                decline the easier
                all set Forms
                of prayer,
              
              doth translate it thus, <hi>ad hunc ergo modum orate,</hi>
                pray according
                to this manner,
                and thereupon infers
                <hi>non dicit, hanc ergo orationem, vel haec verba
                proferte,</hi> c. Christ doth not say,
                saith
                he, repeat this Prayer, or use these
                words
                which you hear me speak; but let your
                Prayers
                be made
                by this rule and pattern which is
                laid
                before you. In which, if they intend no more than this,
                that Christ our Saviour did
                not so confine his followers
                to those very words,
                but that they might express their
                minds,
                and represent their Prayers
                unto the Lord in such other Forms
                as might be serviceable to that end and purpose, for which
                Prayers
                are made;
                they shall take me with them.
                I know not any sober-minded
                man, who will gain-say them
                in this matter, if they mean no otherwise. S.
                <hi>Augustin</hi> did
                so state it many years
                agone. <hi>Liberum quidem est</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>aliis atque aliis verbis, eadem tamen, quae haec
                oratio continet, in orando dicere; sed non est liberum
                alia  diversa  contraria dicere.</hi>
              
              But if they mean that this celestial Form
                was
                made
                for imitation only, not at all for use, I mean not to be
                used
                precisely
                in our saviours
                words;
                I must needs
                crave their pardon, if I leave them
                there. For when it is
                affirmed
                by <hi>Musculus, non dicit, hanc ergo orationem, vel haec
                verba proferte,</hi> when it is
                said
                by <hi>Calvin, non jubet Christus suos conceptis verbis
                orare;</hi> when it is
                thought to be so <hi>hard a task to prove from
                Scripture,</hi>
              
              <hi>that the Disciples
                were
                tyed
                to the use of this</hi>
              
              
              Form; and that the often reiterating
                thereof in our publick
                Liturgy, is
                judged
                a matter so
                impertinent, as to be reckoned
                for <hi>a stumbling
                block before the feet
                of many.</hi>
              
              I cannot sec
                but that their meaning
                is
                to exclude the use of this divine and Heavenly Prayer from
                Gods
                publick
                Worship, if not from the devotions
                also of Gods
                Saints
                in private. This if it be their mind and
                meaning,
                as by the practice of some men
                it may seem to be; I must there leave
                them
                to themselves. Our Saviours
                <hi>dicite</hi> delivered
                plainly
                and expresly
                in his holy Gospel, is
                no idle word, who being
                required
                by his Disciples
                to teach them
                what and how to pray, tells
                them
                in plain terms,
                <hi>Dicite,</hi> say, <hi>Our Father which art in
                Heaven,</hi> with the rest that
                followeth.
                And this, as is
                affirmed
                by good interpreters,
                and very faintly,
                if at all gain-said
                by <hi>Calvin (in his hac ale re cum nemine pugnare
                volo</hi>) was
                at a different time, and on a different occasion, from
                that which by S. <hi>Matthew</hi>
                was
                before related.
                Though <hi>sic,</hi> or <hi>ad hunc modum,</hi> as it
                is
                in <hi>Musculus,</hi> may serve
                exceeding
                well for imitation: yet <hi>Dicite,</hi> of it self,
                without either of them,
                will not be denied,
                to serve as strongly
                for the use. And sure the Fathers
                so conceived
                it. Of whom
                thus <hi>Cyprian, Qui enim fecit vivere, docuit 
                orare, ut dum prece  oratione
                quam filius docuit, apud patrem loquimur, facilius
                exaudiamur.</hi> He,
              
              saith
                the holy Martyr, who made
                us to live, hath
                also taught
                us to pray, that while we speak unto the Father in that
                prayer and orizon
                which the Son hath
                taught
                us, we may be heard
                with more facility. And not long after, <hi>Agnoscat pater
                filii verba cum precem facimus;</hi> Let the Almighty
                Father hear the words
                of hsi blessed
                Son, when we make our prayers.
                The like to which we have in <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> if not
                hence derived,
              
              <hi>Cognoscit Pater filii sui sensus  verba,</hi>
                that the Heavenly Father knows
                right well the words
                and meanin gof his Son. And what else doth
                <hi>Tertullian</hi> mean, when he
                informs
                us that this most excellent
                prayer being
                then animated
                by the spirit, when it proceeded
                from the divine mouth of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Suo
                privilegio ascendit in coelum, commendans Patri quae
                filius docuit,</hi> doth by a special
                priviledge
                ascend to Heaven,
              
              commending
                to the Father
                those devotions
                which were
                taught
                and dictated
                by the Son? Add here the care that
                hath
                been
                taken
                in the times
                of old, that Children
                should be taught
                this Prayer in their tender years,
                (for which consult S. <hi>Austin,
                Serm.</hi>
                1. Mat. 2. in <hi>Dominica</hi> 10. <hi>de Christiano
                nomine,  Concil.
                Rhemens.</hi> cap. 2.) and then I doubt not but it will
                appear to indifferent men,
                that this most excellent Form of Prayer
                was
                prescribed
                for use, and not laid
                down only for our imitation, and no more than so.
            </p>
            <p>
              So then, we have a Form of Prayer
                prescribed
                by Christ to his Disciples,
              
              to be used
                by them
                on occasions,
                at the least in private. When it
                became
                a part of the publick
                Liturgy, and by whose Authority, we shall
                shortly
                see. In the mean time, the next thing here to be
                considered,
                is,
                the institution of the Sacraments;
                in both of which, our Lord prescribed
                not the matter only, but the Form and
                words,
                wherewith the one is
                to be ministred,
                and the other celebrated.
                But you must understand me of that Form, those
                words
                which are essential to the Sacraments;
                and not of those which have been
                added
                by the Chuch for the procuring
                of a greater
                reverence to those Acts
                of Worship, and the exciting
                of devotion in all those that attend the Service. The Form
                of Baptism so determined
                in those words
                of Christ, <hi>go ye and teach all
                Nations,
                Baptizing
                them
                in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
                Ghost:</hi>
              
              That when the <hi>Arrians</hi>
                were
                suspected
                not to use the same, but rather to
                Baptize
                <hi>in nomine patris, per filium in Sp. sancto,</hi> as
                'tis said
                they did;
                it was
                decreed
                in the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> that if upon examination
                it did
                so appear,
              
              those who had
                been
                Baptized
                in so void a Form, should be a new
                admitted
                to that holy Sacrament. And for the
                Sacrament
                of the blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> so far forth as the
                Rites
                and Form of Celebration used
                by Christ our Saviour, are declared
                in Scripture, there is
                no question made
                amongst Learned
                men,
                but they were
                Obligatory to the Church for succeeding
                Ages.
                The blessing
                of the Bread, the breaking
                of it, and the distributing
                thereof unto his Apostles;
                the blessing
                of the Cup, and the communicating
                of the same to all the Company: those formal Energetical
                words,
                <hi>Take, eat, this is
                my Body,</hi> and <hi>drink ye all of this, this
                is
                the Cup,</hi> c. and all this to be
                <hi>done
                in remembrance of me:</hi> Are rites
                and actions
                so determined,
                words
                so prescribed,
                and so precisely
                to be used,
                that it is
                not in the Churches
                power (unless she mean to set up a Religion of her own
                devising)
                for to change the same. And this, I take it,
                is
                agreed
                on by all Learned
                <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                Certain I am,
                it was
                so in the Churches
                practice from the first beginning;
                as may appear to any one who will take the
                pains
                to compare the Rites
                and Form of administration used
                by S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Associates
                in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
              
              with that which was
                both done
                and prescribed
                by Christ, according
                as it is
                related
                in the holy Gospel. A further
              
              
              
              proof hereof we shall e're long. Nor find I any difference
                considerable amongst moderate
                men,
                touching
                the Priest or Minister ordained
                by Christ, for the perpetuating
                of this Sacrament, for the commemoratingof his death and
                passion, until his coming
                unto judgement. The publick
                exercises
                of Religion would be but ill performed
                without a
                Priesthood; and that would soon be
                brought
                to nothing, at least reduced
                unto contempt and scorn, if every one that
                listeth
                might invade the Office. Our Saviour therefore, when he
                did
                institute this Sacrament (or as the
                Fathers
                called
                it without offence in those pious
                times,
                the Sacrifice of the blessed
                <hi>Eucharist, Cum novi Testamenti novam docuit
                oblationem,</hi>
              
              to use the words
                of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) give an
                <hi>hoc facite</hi> unto his Apostles,
                a faculty to them
                and their successors
                in the Evangelical Priesthood, to do as he
                had
                done
                before, that is
                to take the Bread, to bless to break it, and to distribute
                it amongst the Faithful, to sanctifie
                the Cup, and then to give it to the Congregation,
                Men
                of on Orders
                in the Church, may <hi>edere  bibere,</hi> as the
                Lord appointed;
                and happy 'tis, they are permitted
                to enjoy such sweet refection. But for <hi>hoc
                facere,</hi> that's the Priests
                peculiar. And take they heed who do usurp upon the Office,
                lest the Lord strike them
                with a fouler
                Leprosie
                than he did
                <hi>Uzzah,</hi>
              
              when he usurped
                upon the Priesthood, and would needs
                offer Incense in the House of God. These
                points
                are little controverted
                amongst sober men.
                The matter most in question which
                concerns
                this business, is,
                whether our Redeemer used
                any other either Prayers
                or Blessings,
                when he did
                institute
                this blessed
                Sacrament, than what were
                formerly
                in use amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                when they did
                celebrate their Passeover;
                and if he did,
                then whether he commended
                them
                unto his Apostles,
                or left them
                to themselves to compose such Prayers
                as the necessities
                of the Church required,
                and might seem best to them
                and the Holy Ghost. This we shall best discover by the
                following
                practice, in which it will appear on a careful search,
                that the Apostles
                in their times,
                and the Church afterwards
                by their example, did
                use and institute such Forms
                of Prayer, and Praise, and Benedictions
                in the Solemnities
                of the blessed
                Sacrament, of which there is
                no <hi>constat</hi> in the Book of God, that they
                were
                used
                at that time by our Saviour Christ. And if they
                kept
                themselves to a prescript
                Form in celebration of the Eucharist, as we shall
                shortly
                see they did;
                then we may easily
                believe it was
                not long before they did
                the like in all the acts
                of publick
                Worship; according
                as the Church increased,
                and the Believers
                were
                disposed
                of into
                Congregations.
            </p>
            <p>
              And first,
              
              beginning
                with the Apostles,
                it is
                delivered
                by the Ancients,
                that in the Consecration of the Sacrament of Christs Body
                and Blood, they used
                to say the Lords
                Prayer.
              
              There is
                a place in <hi>Hierome,</hi> which may seem to intimate
                that this was
                done
                by Christs appointment. <hi>Sic docuit Apostolos suos</hi>
                (saith
                that Reverend Father) <hi>ut quotidie in corporis illius
                sacrificio credentes audeant loqui, Pater noster,</hi>
                c. Whether his words
                will bear that meaning
                I can hardly
                say. Certain I am,
                they are alledged
                to this purpose by a late Learned
                writer,
              
              who saying
                first, <hi>Eam</hi> (i. e. <hi>orationem Dominicam</hi>)
                <hi>in Missae sacro dicendam Christus ipse Apostolos
                docuit,</hi> that Christ instructed
                his Apostles
                to say the Lords
                Prayer in the Celebration of that Sacrament (or in the
                Sacrifice of the Mass, as he calls
                it there) doth for the proof thereof vouch these
                words
                of <hi>Hierome.</hi> But whether it
                were
                so or not, most sure it is
                that the Apostles
                are reported
                to have used
                that Prayer, as often as they Celebrated
                the Communion. <hi>Mos fuit Apostolorum</hi>
                (saith
                S. <hi>Gregory</hi>) <hi>ut ad ipsam solummodo orationem
                Dominicam, oblationis hostiam consecrarent.</hi>
                It was,
              
              saith
                he, the use or custom of the Apostles
                to Consecrate the Host or Sacrament with
                reciting
                only the Lords
                Prayer. Which passage, if he took
                from that of <hi>Hierome,</hi> as some think he
                did,
                the one may not unfitly
                serve to explain the other. The like
                saith
                <hi>Durand</hi> in his <hi>Rationale.</hi> The Lord
                saith
                he did
                institute the Sacrament
                with no other words
                than those of Consecration only; <hi>Quibus Apostoli
                adjecerunt
                orationem Dominicam,</hi> to which the
                Apostles
                added
                the Lords
                Prayer: And in this wise did
                <hi>Peter</hi> first say Mass (you must understand
                him
                of the Sacrament) in the <hi>Eastern</hi>
                parts.
              
              <hi>Platina</hi> saith
                the like as to S. <hi>PETER, Eum ubi consecraverit,
                oratione</hi>
                Pater noster <hi>usum esse,</hi> That in the Consecration
                of the Sacrament, he used
                to say the Lords
                Prayer, or the <hi>Pater noster.</hi> See to this purpose
                <hi>Antonius,</hi> tit. 5. cap. 2. §. 1.
                <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> and
                some later
                Writers.
                By which, as it is
                clear and evident, that the Apostles
                used
                the Lords
                Prayer in the Celebration of the holy
                Mysteries,
                which is
                a most strong argument that it was
                given
                them
                to be used
                or said,
                not to be imitated
                only: So it may seem by <hi>Gregories solummodo,</hi> that
                they used
                the Lords
                Prayer and nothing else. And therefore that of
                <hi>Gregory</hi> must be understood,
                either that they used
                no other Prayer in the very act of Consecration, or that
                they closed
                the Form of
              
              
              Consecration with that Prayer of Christs; which may well
                be without excluding
                of the words
                of Consecration which our Saviour
                used,
                or such preparatory Prayers
                as were
                devised
                by the Apostles
                for that great solemnity. For certainly
                we must not take the words
                of <hi>Gregory</hi> to be so exclusive, as to shut out the
                words
                of Institution, or any of those
                Prayers
                or Benedictions
                which our Saviour used,
                or the Apostles
                guided
                by the Lords
                example, might think fit to imitate. To think that
                willingly,
                or rather wilfully,
                they should omit the words
                of their Lord and Master, which
                were
                so <hi>Operative</hi> and <hi>Energetical,</hi> would
                prove too great a scandal to those
                blessed
                spirits.
                And therefore <hi>Ambrose,</hi> when he
                puts
                the question, touching
                the Consecration of the Elements,
              
              <hi>Consecratio
                igitur quibus verbis est,  cujus sermonibus,</hi> by
                what words,
                and by whose it is
                made
                or celebrated;
                makes
                answer, <hi>Domini JESU,</hi>
                by the words
                of the Lord Jesus. And if the Elements
                are to be Consecrated
                by no other words
                (as the continual practice of the Church of Christ
                seems
                to say they may not) there is
                no question to be made,
                but that the Apostles
                used
                those words
                of Consecration, which they had
                heard
                before delivered
                from our blessed
                Saviour. We could not say they did
                <hi>hoc facere,</hi> according
                to the Lords
                injunction, if it had
                been
                otherwise. And no less probable it
                is,
                that in a work of so great consequence, they fell not
                presently
                upon the words
                of Institution, making
                a bare recital of them,
                and no more than so; and used
                not some preparatory Prayers
                to set an
                edge on the devotions
                of Gods
                people, according
                as the Lord had
                done
                before, who blessed
                the Bread before be brake
                it, and therefore
                of necessity before he gave
                it. Certain I am,
              
              that so it is
                affirmed
                by <hi>Rabanus Maurus, Cum benedictione
                 gratiarum actione
                primum Dominus corporis  sanguinis sui sacramenta
                dedicavit,  Apostolis tradidit, quod exinde Apostoli
                imitati fecere,  successores suos facere docuerunt,
                quod  nunc per totum orbem terrarum generaliter tota
                custodit Ecclesia.</hi> The Lord,
                saith
                he, first dedicated
                or ordained
                the Sacrament of his Body and Blood with Benediction and
                Thanksgiving, and gave
                the same to his Apostles;
                which the Apostles
                after imitating,
                did
                both do themselves, and taught
                their successors
                to do it also; so that it is
                now generally
                practised
                by the Church throughout the world. Here then we take it
                <hi>pro confesso,</hi> that in the Celebration of the
                blessed
                Sacrament, besides
                the words
                of Consecration which our Saviour
                used,
                the Apostles
                added
                the Lords
                Prayer: And we conceive it to be probable that they
                used
                certain Prayers
                and Benedictions
                by way of preparation to so great a business; of which
                more anon.
            </p>
            <p>
              For further proof whereof,
              
              that such preparatory Prayers
                and Benedictions
                were
                used
                originally
                in the Celebration of this Sacrament; we will first see
                what ground is
                laid
                by the Apostles,
                and after look upon the building which
                hath
                been
                raised
                on the same by the holy Fathers.
                First the Apostle layeth
                this ground,
              
              <hi>I exhort therefore that firstof all
                Supplications,
                Prayers,
                Intercessions,
                and giving
                of Thanks,
                be made
                for all men;
                for Kings,
                and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a
                quiet and a peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty;
                for this is
                good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</hi>
                Which words
                are generally
                understood
                not of private Prayers,
                but those which are made
                publickly
                in the Congregation.
              
              <hi>Calvin</hi> doth so expound it for the
                <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers;
                and so doth <hi>Estius</hi> for the
                <hi>Pontificians,</hi>
                as is
                elsewhere noted.
                And that the <hi>Western</hi> Church may not stand alone,
                <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> do both
                expound the words,
                , of the daily service,
              
              which from the first beginning
                had
                been
                Celebrated
                in the Church of God. This I premise as
                granted
                without more
                adoe.
                Which being
                so premised
                and granted,
                and the ground thus layed;
                we are to look upon the building, as before
                was
                said,
                raised
                by the Fathers
                on the place. And here we will begin with S.
                <hi>Austin</hi> first, as one that
                hath
                more punctually
                observed
                the place, and traversed
                the whole ground, and each part thereof, than any one that
                went
                before him;
                who writing
                to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> doth thus build upon it.
              
              <hi>Multa hinc quippe
                dici possunt quae improbanda non sunt, sed eligo in his
                verbis hoc intelligere, quo omnis vel paene omnis
                frequentat Ecclesia; ut precationes accipiamus dictas,
                quas facimus in celebratione
                Sacramentorum, antequam illud quod est in mensa Domini,
                incipiat benedici: Orationes, cum benedicitur, 
                sanctificatur,  ad distribuendum comminuitur, quam
                tot am
                petitionem
                fere omnis Ecclesia DOMINICA ORATIONE
                concludit: Interpellationes autem
                (five ut nostri codices habent, postulationes) fiunt cum
                populus benedicitur, tunc enim Antistites velut advocati
                susceptos suos per manus impositionem misericordissimae
                offerunt potestati. Quibus peractis  participato
                tanto sacramento, Gratiarum actio cuncta concludit, quam
                in his etiam verbis ultimam commendavit Apostolus.</hi> I
                have put down the words
                at large, because they are so full
                an
                Exposition of the several words
                used
                by the Apostles;
                and not an
                Exposition only, but an
                Application, according
                to the several parts
                of the publick
              
              
              
              Liturgies.
                The sense and meaning
                of them
                is
                as followeth.
                <hi>Many things
                may be hence inferred</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>not to be distliked, but I choose raher so to
                understand the same, according
                unto that which I find observed
                in every, or at least every Church almost; that
                is
                to say, that here by Supplications
                we mean those Petitions,
                which we make in Celebration of the
                Sacraments,
                before we come unto the consecration of the
                Elements;
                by Prayers,
                the sanctifying
                and blessing
                of the Bread and Wine, when it is
                put into a readiness to be distributed
                unto the people, which action or Petition every Church
                almost concludeth
                with the Lords
                Prayer.</hi> (Where by the way, we may observe what place
                the Lords
                Prayer had
                of old in the Celebration.)
                <hi>The Intercessions
                are made
                then, when the people do partake of the
                publick
                blessing;
                for then the Prelates
                of the Church, like Advocates
                or Sureties,
                do by the laying
                on of hands,
                present them
                to the merciful protection of the Lord their God. Which
                ended,
                and the people being
                made
                partakers
                of so great a Sacrament, all is
                concluded
                or shut up with giving
                thanks,
                which therefore is
                last spoken
                of by the Apostle.</hi> So far the
                words
                of <hi>Austin,</hi> and it is
                worthy the
                noting,
                that <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> making
                a Commentary on S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
                Epistles,
                collected
                out of several passages
                of this Fathers
                works,
                puts
                down these words
                at large, as before recited,
              
              for the full meaning
                of the place. And if S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                was
                not out in his Exposition, as I have
                heard
                of none that do charge him
                with it, we have not only Prayers
                and Benedictions,
                used
                and commanded
                to be used
                at the Celebration; but such a prescribed
                and determinate Form, as quickly
                was
                received
                over all the Church, The Commentaries
                commonly
                ascribed
                to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which if not his, are
                certainly
                both very pious and of great Antiquity, give us the matter
                of those Prayers,
                which here by the Apostles
                rule, were
                ladi first of all, as a preparatory to the Celebration.
                <hi>Haec regula Ecclesiastica est tradita 
                magistro Gentium, qua utuntur sacerdotes nostri, ut pro
                omnibus supplicent,</hi>
              
              c. <hi>This Ecclesiastical Ordinance</hi>
                (saith
                he) <hi>was
                given
                by by the Doctor of the</hi> Gentiles,
                <hi>which our Priests
                use unto this day, making
                their Prayers
                to God for all men.
                Praying
                for the Kings
                of the world, that they may have their people in
                obedience, that being
                governed
                in peace, they may serve the Lord in rest and quietness of
                mind; as also for all those which are in Authority under
                them,
                that they may govern the Common-wealth in truth and
                equity, with plenty of all things,
                that so all tumults
                and seditions
                being
                far removed,
                joyfulness
                may succeed in the place thereof. For it
                is</hi>
                Bread that strengtheneth,
                and Wine that maketh
                glad the heart of man. <hi>They intercede also for all
                those who are in misery or necessity, that
                being
                delivered
                from the same, they may praise the Lord, the Author of all
                health and safety; finally
                giving
                thanks
                to God for all those blessings
                which he affordeth
                us in this life, that God may so be
                praised
                from whom,
                and Christ, by whom
                so many benefits
                are bestowed
                upon us; that all things
                being
                composed
                and quieted,
                which might prove dangerous unto the Empire, we may have
                liberty to serve the Lord in godliness and honesty.</hi>
                Thus he. And this I could fain know, how little, if at
                all, this differs
                either for matter, form, or place, from the Prayer
                entituled,
                for <hi>the Church militan here on Earth,</hi>
                continued
                till this day in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And that
                according
                to S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (if the work be his) <hi>Secundum
                regulam Ecclesiasticam traditam  Magistro
                Gentium,</hi> conform unto a rule of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
                prescribing.
                I add but this, which is
                observed
                unto my hand by a very learned
                and industrious Gentleman (for I
                am
                willing to acknowledge by whom
                I profit) that in the meaning
                of the Apostle,
              
              as well as in the practice of the primitive Church,
                Prayers
                and Supplications
                were
                to be made
                for all men,
                in the Celebration of the Eucharist, for
                Kings,
                <hi>c.</hi> it being
                neither strained
                nor forced
                (as he notes
                full well) to take the word , or
                thanksgiving (which S. <hi>Paul</hi> there
                useth)
                in that very sense, in which it
                hath
                been
                used
                by <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the
                Apostles
                Scholars,
                for the Celebration of the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> for the
                whole action, and all the Prayers
                and supplications
                which it was
                celebrated
                withal. For why not thus, as well in this place of S.
                <hi>Paul,</hi>
              
              as in another not so likely, where the Apostle
                asks
                this question, <hi>HOw shall he which
                occupieth
                the room of the unlearned
                say</hi> Amen, <hi>at thy giving
                of thanks,
                seeing
                he understandeth
                not what he saith?</hi>
                Of which thus <hi>Beza</hi> in his
                notes,
                <hi>Suspicor Apostolum
                attingere,</hi>
              
              <hi>celebrandae Domini coenae ritum,  solennem illam
                gratiarum actionem.</hi> I am,
                saith
                he, of an
                opinion, that the Apostle in this place doth point unto
                the Rites
                of Celebrating
                the Lords
                holy Supper, and that solemn giving
                of thanks
                which was
                therein used;
                a full description of the which, he
                gives
                us out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> which we shall see anon
                in its
                proper place. Whence had
                the blessed
                Sacraments
                the name of <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
              
              if our <hi>Grammarians</hi>
                and <hi>Philologers</hi>
                be not much mistaken,
                but from this solemn giving
                thanks
                which was
                used
                therein?
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus am
                I fallen
                at last upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle unto those of
                <hi>Corinth,</hi> wherein it is
                conceived
                that the performances
                of the Church are most fully
                handled,
                as they relate
              
              
              unto the publick
                worship of Almighty God. Which though it be, as in
                relation to those times
                in which there were
                such wonderful effusions
                of the holy Spirit, yet being
                that those effusions
                were
                miraculous, and the publick
                offices
                of the Church were
                governed
                by the immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, there are
                not many things
                therein, which may be drawn
                into example in these later
                times,
                in which we must not look for such
                effusions:
                For it is
                well observed
                by <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
              
              . That many of those
                miracles
                which were
                frequent then, are not to be expected
                now. These extraordinary graces
                were
                not given
                but for an
                extraordinary end, which was
                the planting
                of the Gospel in the midst of <hi>Paganism;</hi>
                or where it was
                encountred
                by an
                obstinate faction of obdurate <hi>Jews.</hi>
                And therefore they that do pretend to such special
                gifts,
                as were
                in those times
                necessary for theordering and edification of the Church;
                may by as strong a Charter, for ought I can see, lay claim
                unto the gift of Tongues,
                and the power of Healing,
                and the spirit of Prophesie;
                which yet I see but few of them
                do aspire unto. Passing
                by those things
                therefore in this Epistle, which are not to be
                drawn
                into example, if will appear most
                clearly
                from the xiv. Chapter, that to the
                constituting
                of Gods
                publick
                Service in the Congregation, there
                went
                these three parts,
                Prayer, Praise, and Prophesie;
                which we have formerly
                observed
                to be the three ingredients
                that make up the same. This last, we find much
                spoke
                of throughout that Chapter, particularly
                and by name, verse 1, 3, 5, 22, 29, 31, 32, 39. The other
                two he joyneth
                together in one verse,
              
              <hi>viz. I will pray with the spirit, and will pray with
                understanding
                also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with
                understanding
                also.</hi> Himself informs
                us what he means
                by <hi>Prophesying,</hi>
                where it is
                said,
                that he who <hi>Prophesyeth, speaketh
                unto men
                to edification, and exhortation,</hi>
              
              both which, as the times
                then were,
                there was
                a great ambition in the Prophets
                of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for ostentation of
                their gifts,
                to utter them
                in Tongues
                not understood
                by the common people. This is
                the thing most blamed
                by the Apostle in the present Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that
                in their exhortations
                to the people, or explications
                of the Scriptures,
                they used
                to speak in unknown tongues,
                and not interpret.
              
              And that they did
                the like in the act of Prayer, is
                conceived
                by <hi>Beza,</hi> where he thus
                glosseth
                on the Text, <hi>Orabo spiritu,</hi> i. e. <hi>lingua
                peregrina quam mihi dictat spiritus;</hi>
              
              I will pray in the spirit, that
                is
                (saith
                he) in such an
                unknown tongue as the spirit dictates;
                yet so, that I will pray with the
                understanding;
                that is
                (saith
                he) <hi>in etiam ab aliis intelligar  alios
                instituam,</hi> that I may be understood
                of others, for their information. And this might be, I
                mean they might affect to pray in
                an
                unknown tongue, although the Prayers
                themselves had
                been
                predetermined
                of both for Form and matter. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> if I
                understand him
                rightly,
                seems
                to say no less. For writing
                on these following
                words,
                <hi>Else when thou shalt
                bless with the spirit,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>
                saith
                <hi>Beza,</hi> in <hi>peregrima lingua,</hi>
              
              in an
                unknown tongue) <hi>how shall he which
                occupieth
                the room of the unlearned,
                say</hi> Amen, <hi>at thy giving
                of thanks,
                seeing
                he understandeth
                not what thou sayest?</hi>
                He thus gives
                the sense. ,
              
              c. If thu blessest
                in a barbarous or unknown tongue, the Laity (for he
                had
                said
                before , that by the
                unlearned
                there, he meant
                the Laity) not understanding
                what thou sayest,
                nor being
                able to interpret, cannot by <hi>Amen;</hi> because not
                hearing
                this, , that
                is
                to say, <hi>world without end,</hi> with which the prayer
                or blessing
                is
                concluded,
                he cannot say <hi>Amen</hi> unto it. <hi>Theophylact</hi>
                from him
                to the same effect.
              
              , For whilst thou
                sayest
                <hi>world without end,</hi> obscurely
                in an
                unknown tongue, he hears
                not what thou used
                in the Congregation, were
                prescribed
                and known,
                or else how could the close or end thereof be so
                known
                and certain? Nor is
                this my collection only, it is
                <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi>
                too, as well as mine. <hi>Chrysostomus hunc locum
                tractans,</hi>
              
              c. So <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on this place
                (saith
                he) tell us, that if the people
                did
                not hear these words,
                , they could by no
                means
                say <hi>Amen. Ex quo loco habemus etiam primis illis
                temporibus preces publicas consuevisse per haec verba in
                secula seculorum absolvi.</hi> And from this place we may
                perceive, that <hi>world without end,</hi> even in those
                first times,
                was
                used
                in the close of their publick
                prayers.
                So far <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              And this may yet appear more plainly
                by that other part of publick
                worship,
              
              which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks
                of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of singing.
                For if they did
                not sing at random, as the spirit
                moved
                them,
                but did
                confine themselves unto such Psalms
                or Hymns
                as were
                received
                in the Church; it may the better be
                believed
                that they did
                hearken
                also to
              
              
              
              such prayers
                as their spiritual guides
                had
                provided
                for them.
                Now that they did
                not sing at random, every one as the spirit
                moved
                him,
                needs
                no other argument, but that confusion both of tune and
                matter (especially
                if they used
                also Instruments
                of Musick,
                whereof more anon) which must needs
                follow thereupon; more dreadful than the noise of
                <hi>Babel.</hi> Nor is
                it evident, that he to whom
                the spirit did
                first prompt such a Psalm or Hymn,
                did
                like the Chanter in our Quires,
                or any other of our Vicars
                Choral, sign the verse alone, and then the Congregation
                sing it after him,
                as the Quire or Consort. For though <hi>Paraeus</hi> seem
                to be of this question, <hi>alios decantare hymnos
                sacros
                 spiritu dictatos vel meditatos,</hi>
              
              That some, according
                to their gifts,
                did
                sing some holy Hymns,
                which had
                been
                dictated
                by the spirit: Yet I subscribe rather unto that of
                <hi>Calvin,</hi> who thinks
                that it is
                meant
                of <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms,
                which were
                accustomed
                to be sung
                in the Christian church, even from the first
                beginnings
                of it, according
                as before in that of <hi>Jewry. Nec vero mihi dubium
                est</hi> (as he states
                it there) <hi>quin ritum Judaicae
                Ecclesiae statim ab initio in Psalmis fuerint
                imitati.</hi>
              
              <hi>Musculus</hi> is
                of this mind also, save that to
                <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms,
                he adds
                such other Hymns
                and spiritual songs
                <hi>(sive Psalmos Davidis
                five alia quaedam cecinerint)</hi> which
                were
                composed
                for the use of the Congregation.
              
              And certainly
                it is
                a matter past all question, that these
                Coelestial
                songs
                of <hi>David,</hi> and such others (if more such there
                were)
                who did
                contribute to the making
                up of the Book of Psalms,
                have been
                a special part of Gods
                publick
                worship, even from the cradle of the Church. It
                had
                not else been
                grown
                to so considerable an
                esteem in the publick
                Liturgy, in and before the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> (and
                consequently
                of S. <hi>John</hi>) as we find in <hi>Pliny;</hi> who
                tells
                us of the Christians
                then, that they did
                <hi>stato die ante lucent convenire,</hi>
              
              <hi>carmenque Christo quasi deo dicere secum invicem,</hi>
                Assemble before light on the days
                appointed,
                and sing praise (or Hymns)
                to Christ, as God, with one another. But we shall speak
                with <hi>Pliny</hi> more at large hereafter. In the mean
                time, if any question should be
                moved,
                what the Apostle did
                dislike in the act of singing,
                (for somewhat he disliked
                most certain;) we answer, as before in the case of prayer,
                that he disliked
                their affectation in singing
                the accustomed
                Psalms
                in an
                unknown
                language.
              
              S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> toucheth
                on this string, where he observeth
                <hi>homines Latinos Grace cant are,</hi> that many of the
                <hi>Latines</hi>
                used
                to sing in <hi>Greek,</hi> being
                taken
                only with the smooth cadence of the
                words,
                <hi>nescientes tamen quid dicant;</hi> but yet not
                knowing
                what they said.
                But <hi>Musculus</hi> is
                more express and positive to the point in hand,
                conceiving
                that the fault here found by the Apostle,
                was
                that some of them
                used
                to sing <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms
                in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue,
              
              which was
                not understood
                by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                being
                most part <hi>Grecians;</hi>
                and that he therefore did
                admonish them,
                <hi>sub sua persona,</hi> as speaking
                of himself in his own person, to sing the
                Psalms
                in such a Tongue as might be understood
                of the Congregation. If any shall observe yet further from
                the present
                Text, that besides
                the use of Psalms
                and Anthems
                in the Congregation, they used
                also Instruments
                of Musick
                in those early times,
                when, and as often as they sung
                those Hymns
                or Psalms,
                <hi>per me licet,</hi> I will be no hinderance. The word
                there used
                in the Orignial will bear it well.
              
              , <hi>Citharam pulsantes, fidibus
                canentes;</hi> and , proprie de sonitu
                fidium dicitur; say no mean <hi>Grammarians.</hi>
                And this is
                noted
                also by as great Divines.
                <hi>Psallere proprie est ad instrumentum canere,</hi> as
                we read in <hi>Musculus;</hi>
                , <hi>apud Graecos non est canere
                simpliciter, sed ad musicum instrumentum;</hi> and from
                thence came
                the Instrument which is
                called
                the Psaltery, so saith
                <hi>P. Martyr;</hi> the very same
                words
                do we find in <hi>Beza,</hi> who
                voucheth
                S. <hi>Augustine</hi> for his Author. And although
                <hi>Musculus</hi> (upon the place)
                takes
                it not for a matter probable, <hi>Primos
                Christianos
                musicis instrumentis usos fuisse in Ecclesia,</hi> that
                the first Christians
                had
                the use of Musical Instruments
                in their publick
                meetings:
                Yet being
                it is
                said
                by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that these first
                Christians
                took
                up the use of singing
                Psalms,
                <hi>ad ritum Judaicae Ecclesiae,</hi> after the usage of
                the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                as before was
                noted,
                why might they not as well have
                Instrumental
                as Vocal Musick
                in their Congregations,
                since the <hi>Jews</hi>
                used
                both? But this is
                only on the by, I insist not on it. Nor would I be
                mistaken
                neither, as if there were
                no use of the gift of Prayer, in those
                Assemblies
                of Gods
                people. I deny not that. All I endeavour to make good,
                is
                no more than this, that as in the first
                dawning
                of the Gospel, the Christians
                in their Acts
                of publick
                Worship, did
                sing <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms,
                or used
                such premeditated
                Hymns
                as were
                composed
                by men
                enabled
                thereunto, for the publick
                use: So there were
                also certain and set Forms
                of prayer, to which the people were
                accustomed;
                and unto which, as oft as they were
                used
                in the Congregation,
                they had
                been
                taught
                to say <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              But not withstanding,
              
              
              it is
                said,
                that <hi>conceived
                prayer was
                in use in the Church of God before
                Liturgies;</hi>
                and a challenge hath
                been
                made
                and published,
                for the <hi>Producing
                any
              
              
              one Liturgy (rejecting
                those which are confessed
                to be spurious) that was
                the issue of the first</hi> 300.
                <hi>years.</hi>
                This is
                a two-edged
                sword, or a <hi>gladius anceps,</hi> as the
                <hi>Latines</hi>
                call it;
              
              and therefore must be answered
                with a double ward. For if their
                meaning
                be in the Church of God, that is,
                in the Assembly
                of Gods
                people, in the Congregation, there
                was
                no Liturgy or set Form of worship during the first three
                hundred years,
                because no Liturgy of that time
                is
                to be produced;
                they may as well conclude, that from S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
                coming
                unto <hi>Rome,</hi> till the time of <hi>Origen,</hi>
                which was
                almost two hundred years,
                there were
                no Sermons
                preached
                unto Gods
                people, because none extant of that time. And if they mean
                by Liturgies,
                a regulated
                course and order to be observed
                in the officiating
                of divine service, according
                to the definition made
                by <hi>Casaubon,</hi>
                and approved
                by the Altar of <hi>Damascus,</hi> as before
                was
                said:
                Such Liturgies
                they <hi>do acknowledge to be used
                both by Jews
                and Christians,</hi>
                as long in use,
              
              for ought they say unto the contrary, as
                conceived
                prayers.
                And if such Liturgies,
                Liturgies
                so defined
                as before is
                said,
                then certainly
                <hi>prescribed
                and stinted
                Forms
                of Administration, composed
                by some particular men
                in the Church, and imposed
                on others.</hi>
              
              For what else is
                <hi>an
                Order observed
                in Church-Assemblies,
                of praying,
                reading,
                and expounding
                the Scriptures,
                administring
                the Sacraments,</hi>
                c. as themselves understand by Liturgy; than a
                <hi>prescribed
                and stinted
                Form of Administration?</hi> And for
                an
                Answer to their Challenge, in case we
                cannot
                shew
                any whole Liturgy, being
                the issue of the first three hundred
                years:
                Yet if we can produce such fragments
                and remainders
                of them
                as have escaped
                the wrack of Liturgies
                there were;
                as a man standing
                on the shore, may gather from the
                ribs
                and <hi>Rndera</hi> of a broken
                ship, that some unfortunate Vessel
                hath
                been
                cast away, although he neither knew
                the owner of it, nor ever saw
                it rigged
                and tackled
                in her former bravery. Nor is
                it so impossible an
                undertaking,
                to venture on the shewing
                of a Liturgy,
                within the space of time prelimited; if
                men
                were
                not possessed
                with prejudice, and took
                not up too much of their opinions
                upon trust and credit. Concerning
                which I rather shall present the
                judgment
                of another man, one every way above exception for his
                abilities
                in learning,
                than lay down mine own; and he thus
                declares
                it.
              
              <hi>I find</hi> (saith
                he) <hi>recorded
                in</hi> Durandus <hi>(but upon what warrant or authority I
                cannot find) that till the time of</hi> Adrian <hi>the
                Emperor</hi> (<hi>which was
                about</hi> 120 <hi>years
                after Christ</hi>) <hi>their Liturgies
                were
                all Celebrated
                in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue; and that then the</hi>
                Oriental <hi>Church began
                first to Celebrate them
                in the</hi> Greek. <hi>Indeed me-thinks
                it is
                possible that the</hi> Christians
                <hi>of the</hi> Gentiles
                <hi>might in honour of the Apostles,
                retain the Apostles
                Liturgies,
                in the very Tongue wherein by the
                Apostles
                themselves they had
                been
                first ordained.
                For it is
                not to be doubted,
                but many years
                passing,
                (about ten) after our Saviours
                Ascension, before the Apostles
                left</hi> Syria, <hi>and sundred
                themselves to preach the Gospel abroad in the world among
                the Gentiles,
                and foreign Nations.
                It is
                not to be doubted,
                I say, but the Apostles
                while they remained
                in</hi> Jewry, <hi>ordained
                Liturgies
                in the Jewish Tongue for the use of those</hi>
                Jews,
                <hi>whom
                they had
                converted
                to Christianity: Which Liturgies
                by the Christian Disciples
                of the Jewish Nation, dispersed
                in many Provinces
                of the</hi> Gentiles,
                <hi>might together with Christian Religion be
                carried
                abroad, and gladly
                entertained
                among the</hi> Gentiles.
                <hi>This is
                possible I say, but if it be also true (as I have not
                observed
                any thing in Antiquity that may
                certainly
                impeach the truth of it:) Yet that which
                is
                spoken
                of</hi> Durandus <hi>of those Liturgies
                in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue, must be
                understood
                (I doubt not) of the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>then vulgar and
                usual, that is
                to say, the</hi> Syriac <hi>Tongue.</hi> In all which
                disputation one may clearly
                see, that he takes
                it for a granted
                and undoubted truth, that the Apostles
                did
                ordain Liturgies
                for the use of the Church: The point in
                controversie
                being
                only this; whether or not they did
                ordain them
                in the learned,
                or the vulgar <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Next to descent unto particulars,
              
              there are three Liturgies
                still extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca
                Patrum,</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> and
                <hi>Latine,</hi>
                ascribed
                to <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>Mark;</hi> which if not
                theirs (and whether they be theirs or not,
                is
                <hi>adhuc sub judice</hi>) are certainly
                exceeding
                ancient, as ancient doubtless as the third Century; though
                true it is
                they have not come unto our hands
                without the intermixture of some unwarranted
                additions.
                And if we look upon them
                well, we may easily
                find, that whose soever names
                they carry, they are indeed the ancient
                Liturgies
                of those several Churches,
                whereof those holy men
                had
                once been
                Bishops:
                and they whose Liturgies
                they were,
                were
                willing, it seems,
                to derive their pedigree as high as
                possibly
                they could, to add some lustre to
                them
                by the names
                of such eminent persons.
                The Liturgy ascribed
                unto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> what is
                it for the main and substance, but the foundation or the
                ground of the <hi>Roman Missal?</hi> as may appear,
                comparing
                the <hi>Canon</hi> of the one, with the
                forms
                and order of
              
              
              
              the other,
              
              according
                as they are laid
                down together in the <hi>Bibliotheca.</hi> And if that
                <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Sivil</hi> be not much
                mistaken,
                S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath
                a better claim to that, or somewhat of this kind, than the
                name and title. By whom
                we are informed,
                <hi>Ordinem Missae vel orationem quibus oblata Deo
                sacrificia consecrantur, primum  sancto Petro
                institutum esse,</hi> that the order of the Mass, and the
                prayers
                thereof, wherewith the Sacrament (or
                Sacrifice)
                is
                consecrate, was
                Instituted
                first by S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and
                is
                the very same (saith
                he) <hi>cujus celebrationem uno eodemque modo universus
                peragit orbis,</hi>
              
              which is
                now universally
                received
                over all the world. He means
                the <hi>Western</hi> world, you must take
                him
                so. That attributed
                to S. <hi>Mark,</hi> if scanned
                and canvassed
                with a diligent eye, will be discerned
                to be no other than the Liturgy of the Church of
                <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of which he
                was
                the first Bishop, as is
                elsewhere proved;
                and will appear to be so on painful search, by the
                agreement which it carrieth
                with that of <hi>Cyril,</hi> one of S.
                <hi>Marks</hi>
                successors
                in that See, and a prime pillar of the Church in the time
                he lived:
                As also by comparing
                it with the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Liturgy
                derived
                from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the mother City, and extant
                with it in the <hi>bibliotheca,</hi> whither I refer you.
                But that whereof there is
                the greatest
                evidence, is
                that ascribed
                unto S. <hi>James;</hi> which if not his,
                is
                questionless the ancient Liturgy of the Church of
                <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                of which he once was
                supream
                Pastor under
                Christ our Saviour. The publisher hereof in <hi>Greek</hi>
                and <hi>Latine</hi>
                gives
                us this short note,
              
              S. <hi>Cyrillum Hierosol. Catechesi quinta Mystagogica
                plura ex illa mutuatum.</hi> That <hi>Cyril,</hi> Bishop
                of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                in the fifth of his <hi>Mystagogical
                Catechizings,</hi>
                did
                borrow many
                things
                from hence. And certainly
                the observation is
                exceeding
                true, as will appear on the examination and comparison of
                the several passages,
                which are still extant in them
                both.
              
              Now <hi>Cyril</hi> B. of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                lived
                about the year 350, and was
                then at his height both for power and credit; and if we
                grant the Liturgy ascribed
                to <hi>James,</hi> to be but 60
                years
                before him,
                it must needs
                fall within the compass, of the first three hundred. This
                though it be enough, we will venture further, and ask what
                inconvenience would ensue, if this Apostle be
                affirmed
                for the Author of it? I mean as to the main and substance
                of it, though not of all the intersertions and
                additions
                which are found therein. That S. <hi>James</hi>
                did
                compose a Liturgy, is
                proved
                by <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> out of <hi>Proclus,</hi>
              
              sometimes
                the Patriarch of <hi>constantinople,</hi> a man of special
                eminence in
                the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council. The
                Fathers
                of the Synod, surnamed
                of <hi>Trullo,</hi> affirmed
                of <hi>James,</hi> whom
                they avow for the first Bishop of
                <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                , that he did
                leave a Liturgy behind in writing,
                alledging
                the Authority thereof, for proof that water
                was
                to be mingled
                with the wine in the blessed
                Sacrament;
              
              which passageis still extannt in the Liturgy,
                intituled
                to him.
                And when we find in <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> as he
                is
                cited
                by <hi>Eusebius, Eum ab Apostolis primum
                constitutum
                fuisse Episcopum  Liturgum,</hi> as
                <hi>Cassander</hi>
                reads
                it: Why may we not conceive that he
                had
                that adjunct, as the first Author of a Liturgy for the
                publick
                use? This may be said
                in the behalf thereof, if one list to plead it. And
                were
                there nothing else to persade me otherwise, than that it
                is
                affirmed
                by <hi>Rivet, has
                omnes profectas esse ab inimico homine,</hi>
              
              c. that this with those before
                remembred,
                proceeded
                from that Enemy, who <hi>sowed
                his Tares
                in the middle of the good Seed whilst the
                Servants
                slept:</hi>
                I should not much be set against
                them.
                Although I honour <hi>Rivet</hi> for his
                parts
                in learning,
                I never held
                his words
                for Gospel; no not although they come
                apparelled
                in the Gospel phrase. That it is
                ancient, yea and holy too, they have not the courage to
                deny; and yet have so much confidence, which I wonder at,
                as to ascribe them
                to the Devil, to whom
                I hope, no holy thing whatever is
                to be ascribed.
                Neither <hi>Rivet,</hi> nor any of the
                Moderns
                are so competent Judges
                in this point, as the Fathers
                in <hi>Trullo,</hi> nor of like credit with S.
                <hi>Austin,</hi> who speaking
                of that noted
                passage of <hi>Sursum Corda,</hi>
                used
                in the Liturgy
                of his time, and long time before,
                saith
                they were
                <hi>Verba ab ipsorum Apostolorum temporibus petita,</hi>
                words
                borrowed
                from the times
                of the very Apostles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This being
                said
                touching
                the Liturgies
                themselves,
              
              we should proceed unto the course and order in the same
                observed,
                and to the Forms
                of Prayer and Benediction contained
                therein. But that would be too large a trouble, the
                business of this Inquisition
                not being
                to transcribe whole Liturgies,
                but to find them
                out; besides,
                that most of the material passages,
                whereof such ancient writers
                as are of an
                unquestionable credit have left us any trace or memory,
                will call us back to look upon them
                in convenient time. On therefore to the next that
                followeth,
                whom
                if we rank according
                to the place and time which is
                assigned
                him
                by the <hi>Pontificians,</hi>
                will be the famous <hi>Areopagite,</hi> even
                <hi>Dionysius,</hi> one of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> first
                fruits
                in <hi>Athens.</hi> I know the Books
                ascribed
                unto him,
                have been
                much questioned
                in these searching
                days,
                whether his or not. Nor do I
              
              
              mean to meddle in so vexed
                a question. And therefore, though I rank
                him
                here, according
                to the time and place assigned
                him
                by the learned
                men
                of the <hi>Roman</hi> party; yet I desire no further
                credit should be given
                him,
                than that which he affirms
                is
                made
                good by others, who lived
                most near the time assigned
                unto him.
                Now for the Celebration
                of the Sacrament of the blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> he describes
                it thus.
              
              'O  c. <hi>The Bishop
                having
                ended
                the Preparatory Prayers,
                said
                usually
                at the holy Altar, doth then and thence begin to cense the
                place, till he hath
                compassed
                it about. Returning
                back unto the Altar, he begins
                the Psalms,
                the Clergy which are present, singing
                with him.
                Then do the Ministers
                read the holy Scriptures</hi>
                () <hi>in their
                appointed
                and determinate order. Which done,
                the</hi> Catechumeni, <hi>and such as are
                possessed
                with unclean spirits,
                or are under penance, are removed
                out of the Church;</hi>
              
              <hi>those only being
                left behind who were
                to be partakers
                of the holy Mysteries.
                The Ministers,
                some stand before the Church-doors
                to keep them
                shut, others attend those Ministrations
                which appertain unto their Order. Some of
                whom
                chosen
                for that purpose, present the Bread and Cup of
                Benediction
                upon the Altar,</hi> , <hi>a general
                Confession being
                first made
                by the whole Congreation.</hi>
              
              <hi>Then doth the Bishop say the
                Prayers,
                and give the peace (or kiss of peace) to all the company;
                who having
                saluted
                one another
                (with an
                holy kiss) the</hi> Diptychs
                <hi>are forthwith recited.
                After the Bishop and the Priests
                having
                washed
                their hands,
                the Bishop standing
                against the middle of the Altar, (the
                Priests
                and Ministers
                being
                round about him,
                and giving
                praise to God for all his works)
                proceeds
                unto the Consecration of the Elements,
                being
                then presented
                to the publick
                view. Which being
                thus Sanctified,
                and publickly
                set forth to view,</hi> , <hi>he first
                partakes
                thereof himself, and then exhorteth
                others to do the like. The blessed
                Sacrament being
                thus given
                and received,</hi>
                , <hi>he finally
                descends
                to the giving
                of thanks,
                and so dismisseth
                the Assembly.</hi>
                This is
                the Form of ministration laid
                down before us in the Books
                ascribed
                to this <hi>Dionysius;</hi> in which I see not any thing
                which may advantage those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                unless it be the use of censing;
                but I see much which makes
                against them,
                <hi>viz.</hi> the giving
                of the whole Communion, <hi>sub utraque specie.</hi> For
                should you stumble at the Altar, which
                is
                mentioned
                here, <hi>Ignatius</hi> who lived
                in these very times,
                <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who lived
                but little after, S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and almost who not
                amongst the Ancients,
                will lend an
                helping
                hand for to raise you up. And if you would sum up the Form
                which is
                described
                here at large, we have the daily Service, which I conceive
                to be those leading
                Prayers
                which the Bishop first said
                at the holy Altar; the Psalms,
                the reading
                of the Scriptures
                in a prescript order, which possibly
                may be the Epistle and Gospel, as we call
                them
                now; then the dismission of all such who are not
                fitted
                to communicate, the placing
                of the Bread and Wine on the holy Table, the general
                confession of the peoples
                sins
                to Almighty God, the kiss of peace and mutual salutation,
                with the commemoration
                of the Righteous. After all this, the Prayer of
                Consecration, and the participating
                of the blessed
                Sacrament, and finally
                Thanksgiving for so great a blessing.
                In all which, there is
                nothing that I can see (except it be the act of
                censing,
                as before is
                said)
                which savoureth
                not of primitive and Apostolical purity; nothing but what
                is
                worthy of the name and piety of <hi>Dionysius;</hi>
                nothing but what we may observe in
                other
                Worthies,
                near about the time, which is
                assigned
                unto this Author. Finally,
                if the Author be not <hi>Dionysius,</hi> which I will not
                take upon me to determine, yet doubtless he
                is
                very ancient; and for the Books
                ascribed
                unto him,
              
              they are acknowledged
                by <hi>Du Moulin</hi> to be <hi>utilia  bonae
                frugis,</hi> which is
                as much as need be said
                in the present case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us next look upon the Form of Baptism,
              
              which is
                another part of the publick
                Liturgy. For howsoever the word Liturgy be
                used
                sometimes
                to signifie
                no more than the Ministration of the
                blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in which respect it
                is
                the same with , and
                is
                expounded
                so by <hi>Balsamon;</hi>
              
              yet doth it signifie
                most commonly
                the whole course And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                was
                foully
                out when he made
                this note, <hi> patribus Graecis vix aliter
                accipi, quam pro minifterio sacrificii Eucharistiae
                offerendi;</hi>
              
              that it was
                seldom used
                otherwise by the <hi>Greek</hi>
                Fathers,
                then for the Celebrating
                of the Sacrifice of the holy <hi>Eucharist.</hi> But let
                that pass <hi>cum caeteris errorbus,</hi> and go we on
                unto our business, to the Form of Baptism; which we find
                thus described
                by the said
                <hi>Dionysius. The day being
                come in which the party is
                to be Baptized,
                and the Congregation being
                Assembled
                in the holy Church,</hi> , c.
                <hi>The Bishop sings
                some Psalm contained
                in the Scripture, the whole Assembly
                joyning
                with him;
                then doing
                reverence
              
              
              
              towards
                the holy Table, he turns
                unto the party offered
                unto Baptism, and asks
                him
                for what cause he cometh;
                who being
                taught
                by his Surety, first making
                known
                his ignorance and want of God, desires
                that he might be admitted
                to these things
                which pertain to godliness. The Bishop next
                letting
                him
                know the rules
                of a Christian life, demandeth
                if he will conform unto them;</hi>
              
              <hi>the which when he hath
                promised
                to do, his name together with his
                sureties,
                are enrolled
                in the publick
                Registers.
                This done,</hi>
                , <hi>the bishop
                saith
                the holy Prayer, which when the whole
                Assembly
                have consented
                to, by saying</hi>
                Amen, <hi>the Deacon doth prepare himself to strip
                him
                and disrobe him
                of his Cloaths,
                and placing
                him
                towards
                the</hi> West <hi>with his hands
                lift up, requireth
                him
                to bid defiance unto Satan thrice;</hi>
                 <hi>and saying
                to him
                the set and solemn words
                of</hi> Abrenuntiation,
                <hi>when he hath
                thrice repeated
                them,
                he is
                turned
                towards
                the</hi> East, <hi>and willeth
                him,
                having
                both his hands
                and eyes
                heaved
                up to Heaven, to joyn
                himself to Christ, and Gods
                holy Word. Which having
                promised,
                and thrice made
                profession of his faith, the Bishop
                layeth
                his hand upon him,
                and prayeth
                over him.
                Then being
                disrobed,
                the Priests
                bring the Oyl
                or chrism, wherewith the Bishop doth thrice sign
                him
                with the sign of the Cross, and after
                delivereth
                him
                unto the Priests,
                who carry him
                unto the Font, where calling
                upon God to bless and sanctifie
                the waters,
                and singing
                to the Lord one of the song or Psalms
                made
                by the inspiration of the Holy ghost, the party
                is
                called
                by his Name, and thrice dipped
                in water, one of the persons
                of the blessed
                Trinity being
                particularly
                named
                and called
                upon, at each several dipping
                or immersion. This done,
                they cloath
                him
                all in white, and bring him
                back unto the Bishop, who once more
                anointeth
                him
                with the Oyl
                or Chrism, and so pronounceth
                him
                to be from that time forwards
                a meet partaker of the blessed
                Eucharist.</hi> So far, and to this purpose,
                <hi>Dionysius.</hi> But then withal you must observe, that
                this was
                <hi>in baptismo Adultorum;</hi> and that there
                was
                not so much ceremony in the Baptism of
                Infants,
                although it was
                the same in both for the main and substance. Now for the
                Form of <hi>Abrenuntiation,</hi> we find it thus
                laid
                down in the Constitutions
                ascribed
                to <hi>Clemens;</hi> of which it may be
                said
                as was
                before of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> that though they be not his
                whose name they carry, yet are they notwithstanding very
                ancient; and do exceeding
                well set forth the Forms
                and usages
                of the primitive Church.
              
              The Form is
                this. , c. <hi>i. e.</hi> I
                forsake the Devil and all his works,
                his pomps
                and service, his Angels
                and inventions,
                with all things
                under his command. Which done,
                he doth rehearse the Articles
                of his belief in this Form that
                followeth;
                , I believe in one unbegotten and only
                true God Almighty, Father of Christ, maker of all
                things,
                and in our Lord Jesus Christ, his only
                begotten
                Son, <hi>c.</hi> Next after
                followeth
                a set Form of prayer used
                by the Bishop, in Consecrating
                of the Oyl
                or Chrism, and sanctifying
                of the Water. And finally
                this prayer to be said
                by them
                who were
                newly
                brought
                into the Church by Baptism.
              
              , c. Almighty God, Father of our
                Lord Jesus Christ, give me a body undefiled, a pure heart,
                a watchful mind, knowledge without error, together with
                the presence of the holy Spirit, that I may both attain
                and hold fast the truth, without doubt or
                wavering,
                through Christ our Lord, with whom
                be glory unto thee
                in the Holy Ghost, world without end, <hi>Amen.</hi> The
                sum of what is
                said
                before in these two last Authors,
                <hi>Clemens</hi> I mean, and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> because
                the Writings
                attributed
                to them,
                are by the Learned
                thought to be none of theirs; we shall find
                presently
                confirmed
                in the words
                of those who lived
                shortly
                after, and are of an
                unquestioned
                credit amongst all Divines,
                both of the Protestant party, and the Church of
                <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time we will sit down and
                repose our selves;
                concluding
                here so much of the present search, as may be found in any
                of the Writings
                of the holy Apostles,
                or such as claim the reputation of
                being
                Apostolical men,
                the Scholars
                and Successors
                of the blessed
                spirits,
                though now disclaimed
                for such by our choicer
                judgements.
                And yet before I leave this Age, I will see if any thing
                occur in St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                touching
                a Form of Common-prayer, or Invocation
                used
                by the Christians
                of his time; who being
                said
                to be that Child on whom
                our Saviour laid
                his hands,
                saying,
                <hi>Except ye receive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little
                Child,</hi> c. But howsoever questionless the
                Apostles
                Scholar, and Successor to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the See of
                <hi>Antioch,</hi> hath
                informed
                us thus, in his Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> of
                which no scruple hath
                been
                raised
                amongst Learned
                men,
                <hi>omnes ad orandum in idem loci convenite, una sit
                communis precatio, una mens, una spes in charitate,</hi>
              
              c. By which it seemeth,
                that as the <hi>Magnesians</hi>
                had
                a Church or meeting
                place, to which they usually
                resorted
                as a House of Prayer, of which more hereafter; so they
                had
                also <hi>una Communis precatio,</hi> one certain Form of
                Common-prayer, in which they all
                concurred
                as if spirited
                by one soul, and governed
                by one hope, in charity
              
              
              and faith unblamable in the Lord Christ Jesus. Which
                is
                as much as we could look for in those
                times,
                and from a man whose writings
                are not many, nor of any greatness,
                his custom being
                to express himself as briefly
                as the nature of Epistles
                could invite
                him
                to.
            </p>
            <p>
              That in this Age,
              
              the day of worship was
                translated
                from the last day of the week to the first, or to the
                Lords-day
                from the Sabbath, will not here be
                doubted;
                nor can it be much questioned
                amongst sober men,
                but that the Chrisitans of these
                times
                did
                Celebrate
                the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> together with that of
                <hi>Whitsontide,</hi>
                as we call them
                now, in honour of the Resurrection of their Lord and
                Saviour, and of the coming
                down of the Holy Ghost, according
                to the Annual Revolution of those great
                occasions.
                That which hath
                most been
                doubted
                for this Time and Age, is,
                whether the Christians
                had
                their places
                of publique
                worship, and whether those places
                of worship had
                the name of Churches;
                both which, I think, may be concluded
                in the affirmative by convincing
                arguments.
                And first it is
                affirmed
                for an
                old Tradition in the Church of Christ, and
                proved
                so to be by <hi>Adricomius</hi> out of several
                Authors,
                that the <hi>Coenaculum</hi> or upper Chamber, in which
                the Apostles
                met
                together after Christs Ascension,
                was
                by them
                used
                for a place of publick
                worship;
              
              this being
                said
                to be that Room in which our Saviour
                Instituted
                the blessed
                Sacrament of his Body and Blood, the same in which the
                Apostles
                met
                for the choice of one, in the place of <hi>Judas,</hi>
              
              the same in which the Holy Ghost
                descended
                on them
                at the Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the same in which they
                were
                Assembled
                to elect the seven. And finally,
                the same in which they held
                the first General Council for pacifying
                the disputes
                about Circumcision, and other ceremonial
                parts
                of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                This was
                called
                then by the name of <hi>Coenaculum Sion,</hi> or the
                <hi>upper Chamber</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi>
                supposed
                by some to have been
                a part of the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Leper,</hi>
                but howsoever of some Disciple of rank and quality, who
                willingly
                had
                devoted
                it to the use of the Church; it
                being
                the custom of such men
                in those early days,
                when they were
                not suffered
                to erect more magnificent Fabricks,
                to dedicate some convenient part of their
                dwelling
                houses
                for the Assembling
                of Gods
                people, and the acts
                of worship.
                Thus find we in the Recognitions
                of <hi>Clemens,</hi> that the House of <hi>Theophilus</hi>
                in the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> (to
                whom
                S. <hi>Luke</hi> dedicated
                both his Gospel and Book of <hi>Acts</hi>)
                was
                by him
                converted
                to a Church for the use of Christians;
                and in the Acts
                of <hi>Pudens,</hi> whom
                we find mentioned
                by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the second to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                that he gave
                his House unto the Church for the same use also; and such
                an
                House, or such an
                upper Chamber
                rather so given
                and dedicated,
                is
                that thought to be in which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                preached
                at <hi>Troas,</hi> and from a window whereof
                <hi>Eutychus</hi> fell down, and
                was
                took
                up dead.
              
              But to return again to the <hi>Coenaculum Sion</hi>
                before-mentioned,
                certain it is,
                that in relation to those duties
                of Religion which were
                there performed,
                it was
                inclosed
                afterwards
                with a beautiful Church, commonly
                called
                the Church of <hi>Sion;</hi> and by S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> a
                godly Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> ,
              
              the upper Church of the Apostles,
                in which the Holy Ghost is
                there said
                by him
                to have fallen
                upon them;
                begirt
                in following
                times
                with the Cels
                or Lodgings
                of religious persons
                in the form of a Monastery, of which <hi>Bede</hi> thus:
                <hi>In superiori montis Sion planicie,</hi>
              
              <hi>monachorum cellulae Ecclesiam magnam circundant,
                illic, ut perhibent, ab Apostolis fundatam, eo quod ibi
                spiritum
                sanctum accepere, in qua etiam locus coenae Domini
                venerabilis ostenditur:</hi> That
                is
                to say, in the uppermost plain of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the
                Cels
                of Monks
                begirt
                a fair and spacious Church there
                founded,
                as it is
                affirmed,
                by the holy Apostles,
                because in that place they had
                received
                the Holy Ghost, and where they shew
                the place in which the Lord did
                institute his holy Supper. Where by the way this Church
                is
                said
                to have been
                founded
                by the Apostles,
                not that they built
                it from the ground, but because
                being
                given
                unto them
                by some godly and devout Disciple, it
                was
                by them
                Consecrated
                for a place of Gods
                publick
                worship. Now that the Christians
                of this time had
                the like places
                for publick
                worship, as well in other Cities
                as in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Troas,</hi>
                is
                evident enough from a remarkable passage in S.
                <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle, according
                to the Exposition of the ancient
                Fathers.
                <hi>What</hi> (saith
                the Apostle) <hi>have ye not Houses
                to eat and drink in,</hi>
              
              <hi>or despise ye the Church of God, and shame
                them
                that have not?</hi> Where by the <hi>Antithesis</hi> or
                opposition between common Houses
                destinate unto eating
                and drinking
                on the one side, and the Church of God
                designed
                unto Religious uses
                on the other side, it appeareth
                plainly
                unto me, that by those words
                <hi>Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> or the Church of God, we are not
                to understand the Congregation, or the
                men
                assembled,
                but the very place of the Assembly.
                And to this sense the general current of the
                Fathers
                gives
                a strong assurance, none speaking
                more plainly
                than S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and therefore I shall give
              
              
              
              you his words
                at large.
              
              <hi>Ecclesia homines sunt</hi> (faith he) <hi>de quibus
                dicitur; ut exhiberet
                sibi gloriosam Ecclesiam. Hanc tamen vocari etiam ipsam
                domuml orationem, idem Apostolus
                testis est, ubi ait; Nunquid
                domos non habetis ad manducandum  bibendum; aut
                Ecclesiam Dei contemnitis?</hi> That
                is
                to say, the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or the Church, doth
                properly
                signifie
                those men,
                of whom
                it is
                said
                by the Apostle, <hi>that he might present it to himself a
                glorious Church;</hi> and yet that it doth also
                signifie
                the House of Prayer or publick
                worship, is
                testified
                by the same Apostle, saying,
                <hi>Have ye not Houses
                to eat and to drink in, or despise you the Church of
                God,</hi> c. See to the same effect and purpose S.
                <hi>Basil</hi> in his moral, <hi>Reg.</hi> 30. The
                Commentaries
                on S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,
                ascribed
                to <hi>Hierome,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Sedulius</hi> on the
                same Epistle; St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon the place; and
                finally,
                the same affirmed
                by <hi>Theodoret, Theophylact,</hi> and
                <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (all good men
                and true) to whom
                for further satisfaction I refer the Reader. The like
                Argument may be also borrowed
                from those Texts
                of the Apostle, in which he maketh
                mention of the Church which was
                in the House of some particular
                persons,
                whom
                he there remembreth;
                the church which was
                in the House of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi>
                Rom. 16.4, 5. and again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. The Church
                that is
                in the House of <hi>Nymphas,</hi> Col. 4.15. The Church
                that was
                in the House of <hi>Philemon,</hi> in the first
                words
                of that Epistle. Where clearly
                he intendeth
                not by that expression the Christian
                Families
                of those persons,
                whom
                he there remembreth,
                but the Assemblies
                of Gods
                people convened
                together in their Houses,
                which they had
                dedicated
                to those pious and religious exercises,
                as by many other godly persons
                had
                been
                elsewhere done.
                For where he mentioneth
                the Families
                of such godly Christians,
                who had
                not given
                their Houses,
                or some convenient parts
                thereof, to this publick
                use, he doth it in a different expression, and of less
                significancy; as the House of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> 2 Tim.
                4.19. The Houshold
                of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> Rom. 16.18. The
                Houshold
                of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> vers. 11. <hi>Asyncritus,</hi>
                c. and the Brethren that are with
                them,
                <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Philologus,</hi> c. and all
                the Saints
                that are with them,
                <hi>vers.</hi> 15. Brethren, and
                Saints,
                and Housholds,
                in the Texts
                last mentioned,
                but Churches
                in the Text before; because the
                Houses
                of those men,
                or some parts
                thereof had
                been
                converted
                into Churches
                for the publick
                use, as the Houses
                of these last were
                not. And for this Exposition of these
                Texts
                of Scripture, I must ingenuously
                confess my self indebted
                to <hi>Joseph Mede</hi> (a man of most acute and
                discerning
                judgment)
                who taking
                his hint from <hi>Oecumenius,</hi>
                hath
                very rationally
                pressed
                and enforced
                this Argument. This therefore being
                taken
                for granted,
                as I think it may, we have not only set and
                appointed
                places
                for Gods
                publick
                worship in <hi>Jerusalem, Troas,</hi> and
                <hi>Corinth,</hi> but also at <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                where <hi>Philemon,</hi> at <hi>Colosse</hi> where
                <hi>Nymphas,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> where <hi>Aquila</hi>
                and <hi>Priscilla</hi> had
                their Habitations;
                and questionless in many other places
                accordingly,
                and these too honoured
                by the Spirit of God with the name of
                Churches.
                Which makes
                it the more strange unto me, that the name of Church (as
                it denoteth
                the publick
                meeting
                place of Gods
                people, the material Church) should grow so much into
                contempt in these later
                days,
                that our own Sectaries
                at home should in derision call those Holy
                places,
                by the name of Steeple houses;
                or that the <hi>Hugonots</hi>
                in <hi>France,</hi> in opposition to the
                Papists,
                should call them
                Temples,
                choosing
                to symbolize
                rather with the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                than their Christian Brethren.

              WHat doth occur concerning
                Liturgies
                or set Forms
                of prayer,
              
              in the first and Apostolical Ages
                of the Church of Christ, we have
                seen
                before. We will next look into those
                times
                which intervened
                betwixt the blessed
                death of S. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle,
                and the establishment of the glorious reign of
                <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor: During which time, the
                Church was
                always
                strugling
                between hope and fear, whether to conquer and bring in the
                <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                or be mastered
                by them.
                And yet in those uncertain
                times,
                we find apparent certainty of those
                publick
                Forms
                which we are in quest of; and that not only for the
                Ministration of the holy Sacraments,
                but also for the Cement
                of Baptism, I find it thus in <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi>
                , c. <hi>Whosoever
                is
                perssaded,
              
              and doth believe that those things
                which we teach are true, and doth resolve to live
                accordingly,
                are taught
                to fast and pray, and call on God for the remission of
                their sins;
                the whole Church also fasting
                and praying
                with them;
                then are they brought
                by us to a certain place, in which water
                is,
                and are regenerated
                in the same manner as we were
                before; being
                Baptized
                in the Name of the Lord God, Father of all
                things,
                and of Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost. This laver, as
                he after tells
                us, is
                called</hi>
                , Illumination, <hi>because the
                minds
                of those who dispose themselves to learn those
                things,
                are enlightned
                by it. Then he proceeds,
                and lets
                us know,</hi>
              
              , c. <hi>That after the party
                was
                Baptized,
              
              they brought
                him
                to the place of the Congregation, whither the Brethren
                were
                Assembled,</hi>
                , animo intento,
                <hi>saith
                the</hi> Latine,
                <hi>with all the earnestness they could; that they might
                all be found fit and worthy to know the truth, and become
                fruitful of good works,
                that so they might be found to have
                been
                faithful keepers
                of Gods
                Commandments,
                and finally,
                enjoy everlasting life. Which prayers
                being
                ended,</hi>
                , <hi>We salute one another with
                an
                holy kiss.</hi> This is
                the Form summed
                up in brief by <hi>Justin Martyr;</hi> in which, if we
                find not any thing of the Cross, the several
                Abrenuntiations,
                nor any of the other Ceremonies
                spoken
                of before: It was
                not that they were
                not then in use, (as we shall shew
                very shortly)
                but that the Father purposed
                to express no
                more concerning
                Baptism, than the very substance of that Sacrament. And
                now being
                fallen
                on <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> we will from
                him,
                before we leave him,
                describe the Form used
                int he Celebration of the blessed
                <hi>Eucharist,</hi> together with the course
              
              
              
              and order of the <hi>Sundays</hi>
                service. First, for the <hi>Sundays</hi>
                Service, it was
                thus as followeth.
              
              , c. <hi>Upon the</hi> Sunday,
                <hi>all which Inhabit in the Towns
                or Villages
                do meet together in one place; and there the
                Commentaries
                of the Apostles,
                and Writings
                of the Prophets,</hi>
                 <hi>as much as
                serveth
                for that time are read unto us. The Reader
                having
                done,
                the Bishop or President of the Congregation,
                maketh
                an
                Oration,
                exhorting
                the people to the following
                of those godly lessons,
                and instructions
                which are laid
                before them.
                Then we rise all together,</hi> ,
                <hi>and send our prayers
                up to the Lord. Our prayers
                being
                finished,
                and Bread, and Wine, and Water being
                offered
                or presented
                in a readiness, the Bishop,</hi> ,
                <hi>or if you will, the President of the
                Congregation,
                did
                offer up prayers
                and thanks
                giving
                to the Lord with all his might.</hi> Where by the way, the
                word in the Original is
                . Which howsoever it be
                turned
                by <hi>Langius</hi>
                into <hi>quantum pro virili sua potest,</hi>
              
              and that by some translated
                thus, according
                unto his ability; as if the Bishop
                did
                not pray by a present Liturgy, but
                according
                to his own abilities
                in the gift of prayer; yet plainly
                here it means
                more than , in the former place, to
                shew
                the earnestness he used
                in the performance of his office. Now for the ministration
                of the Eucharist,
              
              he describes
                it thus, , c.
                <hi>Prayers
                being
                done,
                we salute one another with an
                holy kiss. then is
                presented
                to the President
                Bread, with a cup of Water and Wine, who
                receiving
                them,
                gives
                praise and glory unto God the Father of all
                things,
                in the name of the Son and Holy Ghost, and
                rendereth
                thanks
                unto the Lord in that be doth vouchsafe these his
                Creatures
                to us; which prayers
                and giving
                of thanks
                being
                ended,
                the people which are present do with a joyful acclamation
                say</hi> Amen. The President having
                thus Consecrated
                the Eucharist, (for so I take it
                is
                the meaning
                of these words,
                ) and the people
                having
                testified
                their assent thereto, <hi>those who are
                called
                Deacons
                distribute unto every one there present, the
                Consecrated
                Bread and Wine, and carry it to those who are absent.</hi>
                . <hi>This nourishment,
                saith
                he, is
                called
                by us Eucharist, whereof it is
                not lawful unto any to be partakers,
                but such as do believe our Doctrine, and have
                been
                Baptized
                for the remission of their sins,
                and purpose to form their lives
                according
                unto their profession.</hi> This
                was
                the course, or order of divine service in the time of this
                holy Martyr, in which we have an
                intermixture of prayers
                and praises,
                the reading
                of the holy Scriptures,
                and then the Sermon, (as now the Sermon
                followeth
                on the reading
                of the Epistle and Gospel) and after all, the Celebration
                of the Eucharist, the whole being
                shut up with thanksgiving to the Lord our God. A
                clearer
                illustration of this course we shall see anon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mean while proceed we to <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
              
              and see how he describes
                the Rites
                of Baptism, as in his time used.
                <hi>Aquam adituri, ibidem, sed  aliquanto prius in
                Ecclesia sub</hi> Antistitis <hi>manu contestamur nos
                renuntiare Diabolo,  pompae  Angelis ejus.
                Dehinc ter mergitamur,
              
              amplius aliquid respondentes quam Dominus Evangelio
                determinavit.</hi> We go, saith
                he, unto the water, and there, as not long time before, we
                promise in the hands
                of the Bishop, that <hi>we will renounce the Devil, and
                his pomps,
                and his Angels.</hi>
                Then are we thrice dipped
                into the water, making
                more answers
                (to the Interrogatories
                proposed
                unto us) than the Lord prescribed
                in his holy Gospel. And for the Cross, though we find
                nothing in this place, we have it
                surely
                in another, <hi>viz.</hi> in that so
                celebrated
                speech of his,
              
              <hi>Caro signature, ut anima muniatur;</hi> that
                is
                to say, the flesh is
                marked
                or signed
                with the sign of the Cross (for of that he
                speaketh)
                that the soul may be defended
                and fortified
                against all assaults.
                Next let us look on their Assemblies,
                their customs
                and behaviour there; and he makes
                this relation of the course or order
                used
                by the Christians
                of his time in the Congregation. <hi>Coimus in coetum
                 congregationem, ut ad Deum quasi manu fact a
                precationibus ambiamus orantes. Ea vis Deo grata est.
                Oramus etiam pro Imperatoribus, pro Ministris eorum 
                potestaibus, pro statu seculi, pro rerum
                quiete,
                pro mora finis. Cogimur ad sacrarum literarum
                commemorationem, si quid praesentium rerum qualitas aut
                praemonere cogit aut recognoscere. Certe fidem sanctis
                vocibus poscimus, spem erigimus,
                fiduicam figimus;
              
              disciplinam nihilominus praeceptorum inculcationibus
                densamus.</hi>
              <q>
                We meet (saith
                  he) in an
                  Assembly
                  or Congregation, that we may besiege God in our
                  prayers,
                  as with an
                  Army. Such violence is
                  acceptable unto God. We pray for
                  Emperors
                  and their Ministers,
                  and Potestates, for the state of the whole world, the
                  quiet government of the affairs
                  thereof, and for the putting
                  off of the last day. We are assembled
                  to commemorate or hear the holy
                  Scriptures,
                  if the condition of our present state doth either need
                  to be premonished
                  or reviewed.
                  Assuredly
                  by the repetition of those holy
                  words,
                  our faith is
                  nourished,
                  our hope assured,
                  our confidence
                  confirmed;
                  yet so, that the severity of discipline
                  is
                  strengthened
                  by the frequent
                
                
                inculcating
                  of Gods
                  Commandments.
              </q>
              In which description of their meetings,
                there is
                no mention of the Eucharist, not that it
                was
                not Celebrated
                then in all publick
                Assemblies,
                but because as <hi>Cassander</hi>
                well observeth,
                <hi>ad Paganos  nondum initiatos sermo
                haberetur,</hi> he did
                address his whole discourse to Heathen-men,
                such as were
                not yet initiated
                in the faith of Christ; to whom
                the Christians
                of those times
                imparted
                not the knowledge of the holy Mysteries.
                In other of his books,
                especially
                in those entituled
                <hi>ad uxorem,</hi> there's enough of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nor is
                it to be thought, because <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                speaks
                not of the present place,
              
              nor <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in the passage
                produced
                before, that they sung
                no Psalms,
                nor gave
                that part of worship no convenient place in the
                performance of their Service. We find that, and the course
                of their publick
                worship thus pointed
                at unto us in another place. <hi>Jam vero prout Scripturae
                leguntur, aut</hi> Psalmi <hi>canuntur, aut adlocutiones
                proferuntur,</hi>
              
              <hi>aut petitiones delegantur; ita inde materae visionibus
                subministrantur.</hi> Now (saith
                he) as the Scriptures
                are read, or Psalms
                sung,
                or Exhortations
                made,
                or Prayers
                tendred,
                so is
                matter ministred
                unto her visions.
                Where we may see that singing
                of the Psalms
                was
                in use amongst them,
                as well as any other part of publick
                worship, of what sort soever. Conceive by
                singing
                here, as in other Books
                and Authors
                about this time, such singing
                of the Psalms
                as is
                now in use in the Cathedrals
                of this Kingdom, after a plain tune, as it
                is
                directed
                in the Rubricks
                of the Common-prayer book; and not the
                singing
                of the Psalms
                in Metre, as hath
                been
                used,
                and is
                still in <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches.
                The singing
                in those times
                in use was
                little more than a melodious pronunciation, though
                afterwards
                upon occasion of a <hi>Canon</hi>
                made
                in the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it
                came
                to be more perfect and exact, according
                to the rules
                of harmony; and in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time
                was
                so full and absolute, that he ascribes
                a great cause of his conversion to the
                powers
                thereof, calling
                to mind those frequent tears,
                <hi>quas fudi ad cantus Ecclesiae tuae,</hi> which
                had
                been
                drawn
                from him
                by this sacred Musick,
                by which his soul was
                humbled,
                and his affections
                raised
                to the height of godliness. But whatsoever
                was
                the Musick
                of these first times,
                Musick
                assuredly
                they had
                in their publick
                service, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                tells
                us, whom
                we may credit in this point. And if we please to look, we
                may be also sure to find the same in that place of
                <hi>Pliny,</hi> which before we
                touched
                at; Which here take more at large in the
                Authors
                words.
                The Christians
                on examination did
                acknowledge,
              
              <hi>quod soliti essent state die ante lucem convenire,
                carmenque Christo tanquam Deo canere secum
                invicem;
                seque sacramento non in scelus aliquod obstringere, sed ne
                furta, ne larocinia, ne adulteria
                committerent, ne fidem fallerent, ne depositum appellati
                abnegarent: His peractis morem sihi discedendi fuisse,
                rursusque coeundi ad capiendum cibum promiscuum tamen
                 innoxium.</hi>
              <q>They did
                confess (saith
                he) that they were
                accustomed
                to assemble on their appointed
                times,
                before day-light, and to sing Hymns
                or Songs
                of praise to Christ, as to a god, amongst themselves; and
                to bind themselves by Oath or Sacrament, not to the
                doing
                of any wickedness, but not to commit
                Thefts,
                Robberies,
                or Adulteries,
                demanded;
                and this being
                done,
                they used
                to depart, and then meet again to eat
                together,
                their meat being
                ordinary, and the manner of their
                eating
                inoffensive.</q>
              Which last was
                added,
                as I take it, to clear them
                of the slander which was
                raised
                against them
                by their malicious Enemies;
                who charged
                them
                with eating
                humane flesh, and the blood of Infants,
                as you may see in most of the Apologies
                which the Christians
                published
                in those times.
                Note also that their meeting
                thus to eat together,
                which is
                here last spoken
                of by <hi>Pliny,</hi> was
                for their Love-feasts,
                or , described
                so fully
                by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologetick;
                and by him
                also joyned
                to the description
                of their course or order at their
                publick
                meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              But here perhaps it will be said,
              
              that the question is
                not at the present about a set order or
                Rubrick
                of Administrations,
                but about set and imposed
                Forms
                of prayer.
              
              And that although <hi>Tertullian</hi> do describe a set
                course and order, yet he is
                quite against a set From of prayer; where he
                saith,
                <hi>That the Christians
                of those times
                did
                in their publick
                Assemblies
                pray,</hi> sine monitore quia de pectore, <hi>without any
                prompter but their own hearts.</hi>
              
              And say they, that it should be so, <hi>the same
                Father</hi> (as they call him)
                proves
                in his Treatise <hi>de Oratione.
                Sunt quae petuntur,</hi> c. <hi>There are some
                things
                to be asked
                according
                to the occasions
                of every man; the lawful and ordinary prayer (that
                is
                the Lords
                prayer) being
                laid
                as a foundation, it is
                lawful to build upon that foundation other
                prayers,
                according
                to every ones
                occasion.</hi> So they, and to them
                it may thus be answered,
                that either those two passages
                of <hi>Tertullian</hi> are ill laid
                together; or else they must be understood
                of private,
                not of publick
                prayer. For that the latter place
                is
                meant
                of those private prayers,
              
              
              
              which every man may make for his own
                occasions,
                is
                beyond all question. And in their private
                Prayers
                it is
                not denied,
                but men
                may use what words
                and what Forms
                they please; so they consider as they ought, what it
                is
                they ask, and of whom
                they ask it. And if this place be
                meant
                of private prayer, as by the Authors
                drift and scope it appears
                to be; then must the other passage be so
                understood,
                or else they are ill laid
                together, as before was
                said.
                Now that the other place so insisted
                on, is
                also meant
                of private, not of publick
                Prayers,
                will appear by this, that there <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                speaks
                of the private carriage of the <hi>Christians,</hi>
                and of their good affections
                to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                Emperors;
                but medleth
                not with their behaviour as a publick
                body, assembled
                and convened
                for a publick
                end. For if he should, it must needs
                sound exceeding
                harshly,
                that every Member in the Congregation should be left unto
                the liberty of his own expression; and their
                Devotions,
                if so ordered,
                could be entituled
                nothing less than Common-prayers,
                by which name <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
                calls
                them,
                as before was
                shewn.
                But that we may the better understand
                <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                meaning,
                we will first take the words
                at large,
              
              and then conjecture at the sense. The
                words
                are these, <hi>Illuc suspicientes
                Christiani manibus expansis, quia innocuis; capite nudo,
                quia non erubescimus; sine monitore, quia de pectore
                oramus; precantes summs
                omnes semper pro omnibus Imperatoribus, vitam illis
                prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes,
                senatum, fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum, 
                quaecunque hominis vel Caesaris vota sunt.</hi>
              <q>We <hi>Christians</hi>
                looking
                towards
                Heaven, pray with our hands
                stretched
                out to protest our innocence;
                bare-headed,
                because not ashamed;
                without a Monitor, because by heart;
                an
                happy Reign, a secure House, valiant
                Souldiers,
                faithful Counsellors,
                an
                industrious
                People, and whatsoever else the
                Prayers
                of a private man (for it is
                <hi>hominis</hi> not <hi>hominum</hi>) or those even of
                the Emperor himself, can extend unto.</q>
              And this he sheweth
                to be the subject of those Prayers
                which he himself did
                use to make for the <hi>Roman</hi>
                Emperors,
                in the words
                next following,
                <hi>Haec ab alio orare non possum, quam  quo me
                scio consecuturum.</hi> I pray for all this to no other
                than to him
                alone, of whom
                only I am
                certain to obtain the same. And sure <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                was
                a private person; nor de we find that he
                prayed
                thus with others in the Congregation; or if he
                did,
                yet being
                the heads
                are certain which are spoke
                of here, the Form may also be prescribed
                for ought appears
                unto the contrary, which was
                used
                there. And for the Monitor, 'tis true, the
                <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                had
                of old their Monitors,
                not only to direct them
                in what words,
                but to what God also they should make their
                Prayers.
                Which thing the <hi>Christians</hi>
                needed
                not, who knew
                they were
                to make their Prayers
                unto God alone; and being
                accustomed
                to pray in the Congregation, according
                to the Form prescribed,
                for the Emperors
                safety, and the prosperity of his
                affairs,
                could without any Monitor or Prompter pray by heart for
                those things
                which concerned
                the weal and safety of the Emperors,
                and those who were
                in Office and Authority by, and under
                them.
                What the Prayers
                were,
                used
                by the <hi>Christians</hi>
                of those times,
                it is
                hard to say, there being
                so little of them
                extant in Authors
                of unquestioned credit; but that they
                used
                set Forms
                of prayer, is
                not hard to prove, as we shall see in the next Century,
                when we have looked
                into the works
                of <hi>Origen,</hi> and spent
                a little time in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                writings.
                If in their Books,
                one of which was
                cotemporary with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the other
                living
                very near him,
                if not with him
                also, we find prescribed
                Forms
                of prayer: I hope it will be granted
                without great difficulty, that in
                <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                time they had
                prescribed
                Forms,
                although those Forms
                appear not upon good record.
            </p>
            <p>
              But first before we come to that,
              
              we will lay down the course and order of the
                ministration,
                according
                as I find it in the Constitutions
                ascribed
                to <hi>Clemens:</hi> The Author of the which, whosoever he
                was,
                lived
                about these times,
                and may perhaps be credited
                in a matter of fact, although of no Authority (with the
                Learned)
                in a point of Doctrine. Now he describeth
                both the Churches
                and the service thus. ,
              
              c. <hi>When thou</hi> (he speaks
                unto the Bishop) <hi>doest
                call the Congregation to Assemble, as
                being
                the Master of the Ship, command thy
                Deacons
                as the Mariners,
                that places
                be provided
                for the Brethren, who are as passengers
                therein. First let the Church be
                built
                in form of an
                Oblongum, looking
                towards
                the East; and let the Bishops
                Throne or Chair be placed
                in the midst thereof; the Presbyters
                sitting
                on each side of him,
                and the Deacons
                ready and prepared
                to attend the Ministry; to whom
                it appertaineth
                to place the lay-people in their
                ranks
                and seats,
                and set the Women
                by themselves. Then let the Reader from the Desk or Pulpit
                placed
                in the middle of the people, read the
                Books
                of</hi> Moss; <hi>as also those of</hi> Josuah,
                Judges,
                Kings
                <hi>and</hi> Chronicles,
                <hi>and that of</hi> Ezra, <hi>touching
                the return from</hi>
              
              
              Babylon, <hi>as also those of</hi> Job <hi>and</hi>
                Solomon, <hi>and the sixteen Prophets.</hi>
                , c. <hi>Two
                Chapters
                being
                read, let one begin the Psalms
                of</hi> David, <hi>and let the people answer the
                Acrosticks,</hi>
                i. e. <hi>the closes,
                or the burden of the song, as we use to say. Then let
                the</hi> Acts
                <hi>be read, and the Epistles
                of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>which he inscribed
                to several Churches
                by the suggestion of the Holy Ghost.
                Afterwards
                let the Presbyter or Dacon read the
                Gospels
                which</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>have
                left behind them.
                And whilst they read the Gospel let the people stand, and
                hearken
                to the same with silence. For it
                is
                written,</hi>
                Take heed and hearken
                O <hi>Israel; and in another place,</hi> Stand thou there
                and hearken.
                <hi>Then let the Presbyters
                speak a word of Exhortation to the people, not all at
                once, but one by one, and the Bishop last. This
                done,
                all of them
                rising
                up, and turning
                towards
                the</hi> East, (<hi>the</hi> Catechumeni <hi>and those
                which are under Penance, being
                first departed</hi>)
                <hi>let them
                direct their Prayers
                to God, after which some of the
                Deacons
                are to attend upon the Sacrifice of the holy Eucharist;
                others to have an
                eye on the Congregation, and to see that silence be well
                kept.
                Then let the Deacon which assists
                the Bishops,
                thus bespeak the people,</hi> .
                <hi>Let no man here have malice against his Brother; let
                no man harbour any dissimulation: Which
                said,
                the men
                salute the men,
                the women
                those of their own Sex, with an
                holy kiss. After, the Deacon saith
                the Prayer for the whole Church, the universal World, and
                the parts
                thereof; as also for fertility, for the
                Priests,
                the Magistrates,
                for the Bishop and King, and the peace of all.</hi>
                , c. <hi>This
                done,</hi>
              
              <hi>the Deacons
                are to bring the offerings
                to the Bishop, laying
                the same upon the Altar; the Priests
                assisting
                on each side, as the Disciples
                do their Master. Then the Bishop
                praying
                to himself, together with the Priests
                or Presbyters,
                and being
                arrayed
                in a white Vesture, standing
                at the Altar, and maing the sign of the Cross upon his
                forehead, shall say,</hi> The Grace of God Almighty, and
                the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of
                the Holy Ghost be with you all; <hi>and all the people
                shall return this Answer,</hi> And with thy spirit.
                <hi>Then shall the Bishop say,</hi> Lift up your
                hearts,
                <hi>and they reply,</hi> We lift
                them
                up unto the Lord. <hi>The Bishop thus,</hi> Let us give
                thanks
                unto the Lord;
                <hi>the people next,</hi> It is
                meet and right so to do. <hi>And then the Bishop,</hi> It
                is
                meet, right, and our bounden
                duty <hi>above all things,
                to praise thee
                the true God, who wast
                from all eternity, before the foundation of the world
                was
                laid.
                Finally,
                this being
                done,
                let the Bishop give unto the people the
                blessing
                of peace.</hi>
              
              <hi>And as</hi> Moses
                <hi>did
                command the Priests
                to bless the people in these words,</hi>
                The Lord bless thee
                and keep thee,
                the Lord make his Face to shine upon
                thee,
                and grant thee
                peace: <hi>So shall the Bishop use this Form.</hi>
                Conserva
                Domine populum tuum incolumen, <hi>c. Preserve O Lord
                thy people in safety, and bless thine inheritance which
                thou possessest,
                and hast
                purchased
                with the Blood of Christ, and callest
                a Royal Priesthood, and holy Nation.
                Afterwards
                let him
                go to the Consecration, all the people
                standing,
                and praying
                softly
                to themselves; and the Oblation
                being
                made,
                let every one severally
                receive the Body and Blood of our Lord and Saviour,
                coming
                in order thereunto, and with fear and reverence; the
                Women
                being
                also veiled
                or covered,
                as becomes
                their Sex. And whilst that this
                is
                doing,
                let the doors
                of the Church be shut, that neither any Infidel or
                Unbaptized
                person be present at it.</hi> So far, and to this purpose
                <hi>Clemens,</hi> or whosoever was
                the Author of the <hi>Constitutions;</hi>
                which how it doth agree with the
                publick
                Forms,
                still extant on record in the works
                and monuments
                of such Ancient Writers,
                of whom
                there is
                no question amongst Learned
                men,
                we shall see anon.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing must first be taken
                into consideration, and that is,
              
              whether in the reading
                of the holy Scripture, the Minister
                was
                left to his own Election, although not for the number of
                the Sections
                or Chapters
                as we call them
                now, yet to read what and where he would, without
                appointment of the Church. A point which
                hath
                already been
                resolved
                by the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                declaring,
              
              <hi>How it was
                so ordered
                by the ancient Fathers,
                that all the whole Bible (or the
                greatest
                part thereof) should be read over once every year;
                intending
                thereby, that the Clergy, and especially
                such as were
                Ministers
                of the Congregation,
                should (by often reading
                and meditation of Gods
                words)
                be stirred
                up to godliness themselves, and be more ale to exhort
                others by wholesome Doctrine, and to confute
                them
                that were
                Adversaries
                to the truth: And further, that the people by daily
                hearing
                of holy Scripture
                read in the Church, should copntinually profit more and
                more in the knowledge of God, and be the more
                inflamed
                with the love of his true Religion.</hi> And
                certainly
                it was
                a good and godly institution, savouring
                most abundantly
                of the primitive wisdom; though now, I know not how it
                comes
                to pass, it be made
                a matter of no moment, <hi>sive biennio, sive triennio
                absolvatur lectio sacrae Scripturae;</hi>
              
              whether the Scriptures
                be read over in two years
                or three, so it be read at all in the Congregation. So
                little thanks
                or commendations
                hath
                this unhappy Church of <hi>England,</hi> for
                labouring
                to revive the ancient
              
              
              
              orders
                of the Primitive times,
                and to bring the people of the Lord to be
                acquainted
                with his holy Word. But it is
                said,
                that in the Primitive times,
                there was
                no such custom, but all was
                left, both for the choice and number of the
                Lessons,
                <hi>arbitrio Ecclesiae,</hi>
              
              to the discretion of the Church; that
                is
                to say, for nothing else can be the
                meaning,
                to the discretion of the Minister. And this they prove
                from that of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
                produced
                before, where it is
                said,
                that they did
                read the writings
                of the Prophets
                and Apostle, . <hi>i. e.</hi> as they
                translate it, <hi>quoad tempus fert,</hi> as the time
                would bear. But , if
                translated
                rightly,
                is
                indeed <hi>quantum
                licet,</hi> as much as is
                lawful and permitted:
                which quite destroyeth
                their meaning,
                and confirms
                the Churches.
                , <hi>concedo, admitto. Hinc</hi>
                 <hi>impersonaliter,
                exponitur licet, locus est, facultas est,</hi> in the
                common <hi>Lexicon.</hi>
              
              And this appears
                further by the best classick
                Authors;
                , <hi>non licebat
                manere,</hi>
                in <hi>Xenophon;</hi>
                , <hi>quam primum licuerit,</hi> in
                <hi>Herodotus;</hi> so in others also. And that it
                was
                thus in the antient
                practice appeareth
                very plainly
                by that of <hi>Austin,</hi> (though of a
                later
                standing
                than the times
                we speak of) where it is
                said,
                that in the meeting
                or assembly
                for religious Worship, <hi>scripturarum divinarum lecta
                sunt solennia,</hi>
              
              the solemn and appointed
                Lessons
                out of holy Scripture were
                read unto the Congregation. And if they
                were
                <hi>solennia</hi> then, that is,
                set out, determined
                and appointed
                for times,
                and seasons:
                I cannot think thatthey were
                otherwise in these former days,
                unless it were
                on extraordinary and great occasions;
                in which that course might possibly
                be dispensed
                withal; as in the times
                of persecution, and the like extremities.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so we come unto the third age of the Church;
              
              and there we shall begin with <hi>Origen,</hi> who
                grew
                into esteem and credit in the beginning
                of this Century, and so continued
                till the midst. By him
                it is
                observed,
                and exceeding
                rightly,
                <hi>in Ecclesiasticis observationibus nonnulla esse
                hujusmodi, quae omnibus quidem facere necesse est, nec
                tamen rationem
                eorum omnibus patere;</hi> that in the
                usages
                of the Church there are many things
                which of necessary are to be done
                by every man, although the reason of
                them
                be not known
                to all.
              
              Which said
                in general, he thus descends
                unto particulars:
                <hi>Nam quod genua flectimus orantes,  quod ex
                omnibus coeli plagis ad solam Orientis
                partem
                conversi orationem fundimus, non facile cuique puto
                ratione compertum. Sed  Eucharistiae
                sive percipiendae, sive eo ritus quo geritur explicandae,
                vel eorum quae geruntur in baptismo, verborum gestorumque
                 ordinum, atuqe interrogationum ac responsionum, quis
                facile explicet rationem? Et tamen omnia haec operta 
                relata portamus super humeros nostros cum ita implemus ea
                 exequimur, ut  magno Pontifice  ab ejus
                filiis tradita  commendata suscepimus.</hi>
              <q>For when we kneel (saith
                he) in the time of Prayer, and that of all the
                points
                in Heaven we turn unto the East when we make our
                prayers;
                I think the reason why we do so
                is
                not known
                to any. Or who can readily
                assign a
                reason of those Rites
                and Ceremonies,
                used
                both in the receiving
                of the Eucharist, or at the consecrating
                of the same; or of those many things
                which are done
                in baptism, the words
                and gestures,
                the order there observed,
                the Interrogatories
                and the Answers?
                And yet all these we undergo, whether
                revealed
                or hidden
                from us, when we do so fulfil and perform
                them
                all as they have been
                commended
                and delivered
                to us, either by our great Bishop, or his
                Sons.</q>
              Here then we have an
                evident proof, that therer were
                several Rites
                and Ceremonies
                used
                by the Christians
                of this time in the officiating
                of divine Service: several words
                and gestures
                used,
                both in the celebration of the Eucharist, and
                administration of baptism, and divers
                Interrogatories
                with their prescribed
                Answers
                to be used
                therein. Which Interrogatories
                doubtless are the same, which we
                recited
                out of <hi>Clemens</hi> in the former
                Chapter; and
                which this Author also doth recount in another place.
              
              <hi>Recordetur unusquisque
                fidelium, cum primum venit ad aquas Baptismi, cum
                signacula fidei prima suscepit,
                 ad fontem salutaris accessit, quibus ibi tunc usus
                sit verbis,  quid denunciaverit Diabolo: non se
                usurum pompis ejus, neque operibus ejus, neque tellis
                omnino servitiis  voluptatibus ejus pariturum.</hi>
                Let every faithful Christian call to remembrance what
                words
                he used,
                what he denounced
                against the Devil, when first he
                came
                unto the waters
                of Baptism, and received
                the first signs
                of Faith, how he renounced
                all his pomps
                and works,
                and did
                profess that he would never yield obedience to his
                lusts
                and pleasures.
                So that a prescribed
                Form there was
                of abrenunciation, in the Sacrament of holy Baptism: and
                think we that there was
                not also a prescribed
                Form of Prayer, in the time of <hi>Origen?</hi> Himself
                shall tell you that there was;
                and more than so, shall give us such a fragment of a
                prescribed
                prayer, as by that piece we
              
              
              may conjecture at the whole. For thus
                saith
                he, <hi>Frequenter in oratione
                dicimus,</hi>
              
              <hi>Da omnipotens, da partem cum Prophetis, da cum
                Apostolis Christi tui, tribue ut inveniamur ad vestigia
                unigeniti tui.</hi> We say this often in our
                prayers,
                Give us Almighty God, give us our portion with thy
                Prophets
                and with the Apostles
                of thy Christ; and grant that we may tread the
                footsteps
                of thine only Son. In which, saith
                he, we ask we know not what; for in effect we say no
                otherwise, than make us to be hated
                as the Prophets
                were,
                to fall into calamity and persecution as the
                Apostles
                did,
                A prayer this was
                no question, and a prescribed
                prayer, said
                often by the people, in their publick
                worship. And what else think we
                were
                those prayers
                which in another
                place he calleth
                , those <hi>solennes
                preces,</hi> as the <hi>Latine</hi>
                hath
                it: which he saith
                there, they used
                ,
              
              constantly
                and of duty both night and day, that
                is,
                at Morning, and at Evening prayer.
                Assuredly
                it is
                not likely, that if there were
                prescribed
                prayers,
                such as he calleth
                <hi>solennes
                preces,</hi> in the times
                of <hi>Origen:</hi> men
                should be left at liberty in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                days,
                being
                so small a time before, to use extemporary
                prayers
                in Gods
                publick
                worship, of their own fancies
                and devising.
            </p>
            <p>
              The like we may affirm of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> also, in
                whom
                mention more than once is
                made,
              
              of those <hi>Solennia</hi> which
                were
                used
                in the celebration of the blessed
                Eucharist. <hi>Solennibus
                adimpletis, calicem Diaconus offerre
                praesentibus coepit;</hi>
              
              the solemn prayers
                (and therefore a set Form of prayers)
                being
                finished,
                the Deacon began
                to offer the Cup or Chalice to such as
                were
                present. And in another place speaking
                of the Cup, he calleth
                it <hi>Calicem solenni benedictione
                sacratum,</hi> the Cup which had
                been
                consecrated
                with a solemn (or set Form of) benediction. Of which we
                may conclude as before
                we did,
                that if the Forms
                were
                solemn or prescribed
                in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                days,
                they were
                not likely to be otherwise in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                time: whatever other fancies
                have been
                railed
                about it. And that they used
                the solenn or set Form of words
                in the ministration
                of holy things,
                in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                days,
                besides
                the general proof before produced,
                appears
                most plainly
                in his book <hi>de Oratione;</hi>
                where we have it thus.
              
              <hi>Ideo  Sacerdos
                ante Orationem, Praefatione praemissa parat fratrum
                mentes, dicendo Sursum corda: ut dum respondet plebs,
                Habemus ad Dominum, admoneatur nihil aliud se quam
                Dominum
                cogitare debere.</hi> Therefore
                (saith
                he) the Priest before the prayer (that of
                consecration)
                doth by a Preface readily
                prepare the minds
                of the Brethren, saying,
                <hi>Lift up your bearts:</hi> that when the people make
                this answer, <hi>We lift them
                up unto the Lord,</hi> they may be put in mind, that they
                must think of nothing but the Lord, when they are
                pouring
                out their prayers.
                This passage of the Preface (as our and it
                is
                also to be found in those ancient
                Liturgies
                of <hi>Rome, Hierusalem,</hi>
                and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                assigned
                unto SS. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> as
                before was
                said.
              
              That attributed
                to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> thus: . to which
                the people make this answer, . The
                very same with that of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And so
                is
                also that of. <hi>Mark,</hi> or rather of the Church of
                <hi>Alexandria,</hi> save that the word
                 is
                left out, and it runs
                simply
                thus, . In that
                ascribed
                to S. <hi>James</hi> there is
                some difference, the Priest saying
                thus,
              
              . i. e. <hi>Let us lift up our
                minds
                and hearts;</hi>
                to which the people answer there, ,
                <hi>It is
                meet and right so to do.</hi> But this I take to be
                an
                error in the Copy, that being
                the answer of the people to another invitation of the
                Priest, <hi>viz.</hi> to that of <hi>Gratias agamus
                Domino,</hi> Let us give thanks
                unto the Lord: And so it seems
                to be by that which followeth
                of the Priest, in S. <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy: who on
                the peoples
                saying
                it <hi>is
                meet and right,</hi> goeth
                forwards
                in the usual Form, , <hi>it
                is
                very meet and right and our bounden
                duty,</hi> c. But to return again unto S.
                <hi>Cyprian,</hi> we may conjecture by this piece, that in
                his time there was
                a whole and perfect Liturgie,
                though it be not come unto our hands.
                And there's another passage in that very book, <hi>de
                Oratione,</hi>
                which points
                us to that Form of <hi>abrenuntiation,</hi> which
                was
                then used
                by the Church in holy Baptism.
              
              <hi>Potest autem
                tualis abjecimus, cibum nobis tantum petamus 
                victum.</hi> That passage in the Pater noster, <hi>Give us
                this day our daily bread,</hi> may be thus
                interpreted,
                that we which have renounced
                the World, the riches
                and the pomps
                thereof by the benefit of faith and grace spiritual,
                should only crave of God our Meat and Victual. In which we
                have the matter, although not the Form: but that a Form
                there was,
                we were
                shewed
                before out of the Constitutions
                ascribed
                to <hi>Clemens:</hi> and will now further prove it by
                <hi>Tertullian</hi>
              
              
              
              also, who thus brings
                it home. <hi>Aquam ingressi, Christianam fidem in suae
                legis verba profitemur;</hi>
              
              <hi>renunciare nos Diabolo,  pompis ejus  ejus,
                ore nostro contestamur</hi> Entring,
                saith
                he, into the water, we make profession of the Christian
                faith, in the very words
                of his own law: and with our own mouth do contest, that we
                renounce the
                Devil and his pomps,
                and Angels.
                Compare these words
                with those of <hi>Clemens</hi> formerly
                delivered;
                and tell me, if you can, where the difference
                lieth.
                And there's another passage in that book of
                <hi>Cyprians,</hi>
                which points
                us to the hours
                of prayer, at that time in use; <hi>viz.</hi> The third,
                the sixth, the ninth.
                Which having
                shewed
                to have been
                formerly
                in use with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and other holy
                men
                of God, he addeth,
                that besides
                those hours
                observed
                of old, <hi>Orandi spatia  sacramenta
                creverunt,</hi>
              
              the times
                and the occasions
                of prayer were
                both increased.
                <hi>Nam  mane orandum est, ut resurrectio Domini
                matutina oratione
                celebretur; recedente item sole ac die cessante necessario
                orandum est,</hi> c. <hi>For in the morning we must
                pray, that the Lords
                resurrection
                may be celebrated
                by our Morning prayer; and when the Sun
                is
                down and the day determined,
                we must needs
                pray also, that praying
                for the returning
                of the light, we may desire
                of God our Saviours
                coming,
                who will conduct us all unto light eternal.</hi> So great
                assurance
                have we of the point in hand, both for the Form and
                hours
                of prayer, from this book of <hi>Cyprians,</hi>
                that any further search were
                almost unecessary. Now lest it may be
                said,
                as I know some say, that this is
                none of <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                true and genuine writings,
                but thrust upon him
                by some <hi>Sciolist</hi> of a later
                standing:
                S. <hi>Austin</hi> shall come in for witness, who very
                frequently
                doth attest unto it, as <hi>viz. Epist.</hi> 47.
                <hi>lib. de gratia,  libero
                arbitrio.</hi> cap. 13. <hi> lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra
                Julianum,  de bono perseverantiae,</hi> cap. 2.
                Finally
                to dismiss S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the
                <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> though no great
                Friends
                unto the antient
                usages
                of the Church, were
                so convinced,
                (or satisifed, to say the least) with this book of his;
                that they resolve it for a certainty, past all
                peradventure, that anciently
                there were
                set Forms
                of publick
                prayer.
              
              <hi>Formulas denique precationum absque dubio
                habuernunt,</hi> as they state it there; and for the proof
                thereof refer us to this book of
                <hi>Cyprians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              This being
                thus proved,
              
              we may affirm with grief, as some do with scorn, that
                <hi>great must be our loss, who are so
                unhappily
                deprived
                of the best improvement, the Church
                made
                of her peace and happiness,</hi>
              
              <hi>during the first three hundred
                years.</hi>
                No question but the Liturgies
                which were
                then composed
                did
                savour strongly
                both of the piety and affectionof those
                blessed
                times.
                <hi>Whether the blessed
                Constantine was
                herein as unhappy
                as our selves;
                or whether he needed
                not have composed
                a Form of Prayer for his Guard to be
                used
                by them
                on the Lords
                day, but rather might and would have
                taken
                them
                out of the former Liturgies,
                if there had
                been
                any:</hi> will prove a very easie
                Quaere, with whatsoever confidence it be
                made
                a difficulty. For certainly
                there might be former Liturgies,
                and yet no Form of prayer found in
                them
                for that use and purpose, for whch
                that prayer was
                made
                by blessed
                <hi>Constantine.</hi> For we have now a
                Liturgie
                in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (and 'tis my prayer we
                may long have it, naugre the machinations
                of unquiet Men)
                in which are many Forms
                of prayer for Gods
                publick
                worship: yet not so many, nor so
                sutable
                to all occasions,
                but that some Men
                make bold to set forth their own.
                Besides
                the Emperours
                Army did
                consist as the time then were,
              
              partly of Christians,
                and partly of the Gentiles:
                and possibly
                it had
                not proved
                such an
                easie
                matter to bring the Gentiles
                to the use of a Form of prayer (the Christian
                Souldiers
                being
                suffered
                to repair unto the Church upon Sundays,
                and there to make their prayers
                to the Lord their God) which had
                been
                wholly
                taken
                from the Liturgies
                of the Christian Church. But for the prayer
                enjoyned
                by the blessed
                <hi>Constantine,</hi>
              
              it was
                as followeth,
                <hi>Te solum Deum agnoscimus, te Regem profitemur, te
                adjutorem invocamus, per te victorias consecuti sumus, per
                te hostes
                superavimus,
                 te  praesentem felicitatem consecutos
                fatemur,  futuram adepturos
                speramus;
                tui omnes supplices sumus,  te petimus ut
                Constantinum Imperatorem nostrum, una cum piis ejus
                liberis, quam diutissime salvum  victorem
                conserves.</hi>
                In <hi>English</hi> thus.
              <q>We do acknowledg
                thee
                for the only God, we confess thee
                to be the King, we call upon thee
                as our helper and defender: by thee
                alone it is
                that we have got
                the victory, and subdued
                our Enemies;
                to thee
                as we do refer all our present happiness,
                so from thee
                also we expect our future. Thee
                therefore we beseech that thou wouldst-keep
                in health and safety, our noble
                Emperour
                <hi>Constantine,</hi> with his hopeful progeny.</q>
              This was
                the very Form imposed.
                And I believe the blessed
                <hi>Constantine</hi> would never have
                troubled
                himself to compose this Form, had
                he not though that set and prescribed
                Forms
                of prayer had
                been
                very necessary, and more to be
              
              
              considered
                of, than the extemporary prayers
                of his ablest
                Ministers.
                For doubtless, in a CAmp, wherein there
                were
                so many of the Gentiles,
                there must be some Priests,
                to offer sacrifice unto the Gods
                whom
                those Gentiles
                worshipped.
                And it is
                told
                us by <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
              
              that he had
                always
                in his Camp for divine Offices
                divers
                Priest and Bishops,
                Chaplains
                in ordinary to his Majesty: and it
                were
                hard if none of them
                could have made
                a shift, to vent some short extemporary
                prayers
                for the use of the Army. The blessed
                <hi>Constantine</hi> had
                been
                most unhappy, if it had
                been
                so: and pity 'twas, that some of those who are so
                vehemently
                bent against all set Forms,
                had
                not been
                Preachers
                to his Army. Assuredly
                they would have eased
                him
                of that needless trouble. Especially
                since we are told,
                what liberty every Man might take unto himself, in
                praying
                both what and how he listed.
            </p>
            <p>
              For as they say, <hi>this liberty in Prayer
                was
                not taken
                away,</hi>
              
              <hi>nor set and imposed
                Forms
                introduced,</hi>
              
              <hi>until the time that the</hi> Arian <hi>and</hi>
                Pelagian <hi>Heresies
                did
                invade the Church: and then because those
                Hereticks
                did
                convey and spread their poyson,
                in their Forms
                of Prayer and Hymns,
                the Church thought it convenient to restrain the liberty
                of making
                and using
                publick
                forms.</hi>
                A piece of Learning
                not more new, than strange, to us who never
                heard
                of the like before: and such as in conclusion doth destroy
                it self. For if upon the spreading
                of the Heresies
                before remembred,
                the <hi>Church thought it convenient to restrain the
                liberty of making
                and using
                publick
                Forms:</hi>
                there must be publick
                Forms
                before, both made
                and used
                in the Church; and therefore sure they
                came
                not in upon that occasion. And if the
                <hi>Arians</hi>
                and <hi>Pelagians</hi>
                had
                a mind to disperse their poysons,
                and do it with the greater
                freedom: they might have done
                more to purpose (a thing which we observe by too sad
                experience) in arbitrary and extemporary
                prayers
                of each Mans
                devising,
                than being
                tied
                and limited
                by a prescript Form, how well soever
                fitted
                and contrived
                to advance their ends.
                That which they mean, if they mean any thing,
                is
                this, that in the time when <hi>Chrisostom</hi>
                was
                Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the
                <hi>Arians</hi>
                held
                their Congregations
                without the City. But grew
                at last unto that boldness, that when the Orthodox
                Professors
                held
                their publick
                meetings
                as on all Saturdays
                and Sundays
                they used
                to do, the <hi>Arians</hi>
                got
                within the gates,
                .
              
              and there sung
                certain <hi>Hymns</hi>
                and <hi>Anthems,</hi>
                Quire-wise or <hi>alternatim,</hi>
                answering
                one another, which they had
                fitted
                to their lewd and impious tenets.
                This they continued
                for the greatest
                part of the Night, and at day-break
                singing
                thee
                Hymns
                of Songs
                even in the middle of the City, they
                went
                out again to their own places
                of Assembly.
                This when it was
                observed
                by <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to allure many simple
                Men
                to that wicked faction; he called
                out some of his own flock, , who
                falling
                on the same course, and being
                intent on this Night-musick,
                might both suppress the insolency of the <hi>Arian</hi>
                party, and confirm his own people in the faith. This
                is
                the story which they aim at, and this
                makes
                nothing to the purpose. For what
                hath
                this to do with set Forms
                of prayer, so long in use before the time of
                <hi>Chrysostom?</hi> Or if it had,
                yet all that <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                did
                on this occasion, was
                not to take away or restrain the liberty of
                <hi>making
                and using
                publick
                Forms;</hi>
                but rather to increase those Forms
                which were
                made
                before. For 'tis said
                plainly
                in the story, , that he
                increased
                the wonted
                prayers,
                by adding
                those Night-anthems
                to the publick
                service. But they say still that some restrain there
                was,
                of a former liberty,
              
              and such as was
                brought
                in upon occasion of those Heresis
                of which before we spake:
                it being
                first ordained,
                say they, in the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that none
                should pray <hi>pro arbitrio sed semper eaedem
                preces,</hi> that <hi>none should use liberty to vary in
                Prayer, but use always
                the same Form.</hi> Somewhat indeed
                was
                done
                in that ancient Synod,
              
              and somewhat also to this purpose; but neither so as
                is
                delivered,
                nor on that occasion. Not upon that occasion doubtless.
                For if <hi>Baronius</hi> rightly
                calculate the times,
                as I think he doth, the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> with
                those of <hi>Arles, Ancyra,</hi>
              
              and <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi>
                was
                holden
                in the year 314. the <hi>Arian</hi>
                Heresie
                began
                not till the next year after, and the <hi>Pelagian</hi>
                near an
                hundred years
                from that, <hi>An.</hi>
                413. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> not being
                Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> until the year 397. or
                thereabouts.
                So that the Fathers
                in this Council, must needs
                be all inspired
                with the spirit of Prophecie,
                seeing
                they could provide such a certain remedy, so many
                years
                before the mischief.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now as this Council did
                not any thing on this occasion, so whatsoever it
                was
                they did,
                it was
                not so, as is
                delivered.
                The Canon pointed
                to, is
                this,
              
              .
              
              
              
              That the same Office of Prayers
                should be always
                used,
                both in the Morning and the Evening, at nine and night
                (for so I take it we must render ,
                rather than post off both services
                till the afternoon.) These are the
                words,
                which though they serve most evidently
                for set Forms
                of pryaer, composed
                by men
                of eminency for the Churches
                use, and then imposed
                upon the Clergy by the Churches
                power; yet we are told
                that the Forms
                herein spoken
                of, were
                of every several mans
                own composing;
                and that the meaning
                of the Council was
                no more than this, viz. <hi>To forbid
                men
                from varying
                their own prayers
                as they listed,</hi>
              
              <hi>nd to enjoyn
                them
                still to use the same.</hi> By what Authority the Canon
                may be thus perverted
                from its
                proper meaning,
              
              I am
                yet to seek. But sure I am,
                that never was
                the mind or meaning
                of that ancient Synod; or if it
                had,
                they would have put it in such terms
                whereby their mind and meaning
                might have been
                discovered
                in the former times.
                But <hi>Zonaras,</hi> whose glosses
                and interpretations
                I find sometimes
                approved
                by these later
                Scholiasts,
                gives
                us another meaning
                of the Canon, and no doubt a truere; sure I
                am,
                more agreeable to truth of story, and the condition of
                those times.
                And he expounds
                the same directly
                contrary to that which is
                by them
                intended;
                and makes
                the meaning
                to be this, That no man should have liberty to compose
                Forms
                of prayer, or to recite them
                in the Congregation; but only to adhere to those in
                Gods
                publick
                Service, which had
                been
                countenanced
                and confirmed
                by long proscription,
              
              . So his own
                words
                are. And this is
                quite against set Forms
                of ones
                own devising.
                Nor could a worser
                choice in all antiquity have been
                pitch'd upon, to countenance set
                Forms
                of ones
                own devising,
                than was
                this notable Synod of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> wherein there
                is
                so much determined
                for setling
                the received
                Forms,
                and abrogating
                such abuses
                as had
                been
                crept
                into the same, as in no other publick
                monument of
                this time and age. Three of which
                Canons
                I shall here produce, and those three which
                immediately
                precede that now in question. By that we may perceive most
                manifestly,
                how little hope is
                to be found from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> how cold the wind
                blows
                from those <hi>Eastern</hi> parts.
                The first takes
                care to regulate that part of publick
                Worship, which did
                consist in singing
                Hymns
                or Psalms
                to the praise of God, determining
                that none besides
                the ordinary and appointed
                Singers
                should go up into the Desk (or Pulpit) and sing out of the
                Parchments
                in the Congregation. .
              
              That is
                the substance of the Canon. And that, as it excludes all
                other persons
                from singing
                in the Church, but the publick
                Singers,
                such as were
                called
                unto that Office; so it excludes all other
                Books
                of that condition, from being
                brought
                into the Church, but the publick
                Parchments,
                such as were
                framed
                and authorized
                for that very service. Yet so that I conceive with
                <hi>Balsaman,</hi> that is
                to be understood
                no otherwise, than that it was
                not lawful unto every man to go into the Pulpit,
              
              , to name the Psalm, and to begin it
                (as some about this time had
                presumed
                to do:) it being
                permitted,
                as he noteth,
                after the Psalm was
                so begun,
                , that Lay-men
                of what rank soever, if they had
                tuneable voices,
                or could sing their parts,
                might then joyn
                with them,
                asin consort, to make up the Harmony. The next care
                taken
                by this Council was,
                that the Gospels
                and other parts
                of the holy Scripture might be read
                upon the
                <hi>Saturday,</hi> or the old Jewish <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                . Whereof the reason
                is
                thus given
                by <hi>Balsamon,</hi>
              
              because that day had
                been
                formerly
                spent
                in Feasting,
                , and that the people
                used
                not to assemble on it,
              
              for religious offices;
                which to redress it was
                determined
                by this Canon, that on that day as well as others,
                , all sorts
                of Ecclesiastical ministrations
                were
                to be performed.
                The last was
                for the ordering
                of the Psalms,
                concerning
                which it was
                ordained
                that between every portion of the
                Psalms
                (for they divided
                the whole <hi>Psalter,</hi> ,
              
              into several portions)
                , some part of holy Scripture should
                be intermingled,
                lest else the people might be tyred
                with continual singing.
                Here then we have certain prescribed
                Rules
                and Orders
                for the officiating
                of Gods
                publick
                Service, the Palms
                divided
                into Portions,
                those Portions
                intermingled
                with the reading
                of the holy Scripture, a prescribed
                office ordered
                for the <hi>Saturday,</hi>
                and finaly,
                a punctual direction not only who should name or begin the
                Psalm, but from what Book it should be read.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there's another Canon of this Council which
                looks
                more backward,
              
              and did
                not so much introduce any new Orders
                into the Church, as confirm the old; and
              
              
              doth indeed give as full a view of the several
                parts
                and Offices
                of the publick
                Service, as any other of that time whatever. The first
                part of the Service we have seen
                before in <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> that which he
                calleth
                 the Common-prayers
                of the Church, at which all sorts
                of people were
                and might be present. This ended
                with the Sernion, as we saw
                before. And we shall see now more
                particularly
                what they had
                to do, after that was
                done.
                For howsoever it may seem in that place of
                <hi>Justin,</hi> that presently
                upon the conclusion of the Sermon, they
                went
                unto the Celebration of the blessed
                Eucharist; yet that is
                on a supposition, that there were
                none present but Believers
                only, and such as were
                prepared
                to Communicate. But being
                that in those severe Ages
                of the Church, they had
                not only <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> such as
                desired
                to be admitted
                into the bosom of the Church, and
                had
                not yet received
                that Sacrament of Baptism;
                but such as having
                been
                Baptized,
                were
                for their <hi>lapses</hi>
                and offences
                put to open Penance; as well as godly and religious
                persons,
                against whom
                no bar could be pretended;
                the Offices
                of the Church were
                to be so fitted,
                that every one of these conditions
                might not want his part. And this
                is
                that which we find described
                in this Canon thus. ,
              
              c. <hi>After the Bishop hath
                done
                his Sermon, let first the prayer be
                said
                for the</hi> Catechumeni; <hi>they
                being
                gone,
                the prayers
                for such who are under penance, are to be
                dispatched;
                and when they have received
                Imposition of hands,
                and are also gone,
                then let the prayers
                for the faithful be thrice made
                thus,</hi> , c. <hi>the first
                softly,
                every man secretly
                to himself,
                the second and the third aloud, which
                done,
                the Peace, (or kiss of peace) is
                to be given,
                and so they are to go to the Oblation. And let none but
                such as be in Orders
                enter within the rail,</hi> , <hi>or
                come within the place where the Altar
                stands,
                to receive the Sacrament.</hi>
                So far the Canon of the Council, by which it
                is
                apparent that each sort of Auditors
                had
                a peculiar course or Office, besides
                that part of publick
                Service in which they joyned
                all together, as before was
                said.
                But whether the prayers
                here spoken
                of were
                left at liberty, to the discretion of the Minister, or in
                a prescribed
                and determinate
                Form, we must see elsewhere. And in my mind we cannot see
                it at a fuller view, than in the
                Constitutions
                ascribed
                to <hi>Clemens,</hi> undoubtedly
                more ancient than the times
                we speak of, where we find it thus; ,
                c. <hi>All rising
                up, let the Deacon go into some eminent place, and
                say,</hi>
              
              None of the hearers,
                none of the unbelievers
                <hi>depart the place. And silence
                being
                made,
                he saith,</hi>
                , Pray ye hearers.
                <hi>And all the faithful shall pray for
                them
                with a good devotion,
                saying</hi>
                , Lord have mercy upon
                them.
                <hi>Then let the Dacon thus proceed,</hi>
              
              , c. <hi>Let us all pray to God
                for the</hi> Catechumeni, <hi>that our good God of his
                abundant love to man-kind would
                graciously
                hear their prayers,
                and give them
                help, minate their understandings,
                instruct them
                in knowledge, and teach them
                his Commandments,</hi>
                c. , c. <hi>Moreover let us
                beseech God for them,
                that having
                obtained
                remission of their sins
                by Baptism, they may be meet partakers
                of the holy</hi> Eucharist, <hi>and dwell for ever with
                the Saints,</hi>
                c. <hi>Now unto every point or period
                contained
                in this solemn prayer, the people
                answered,</hi>
                , Lod have mercy on
                them,
                <hi>after the manner of the Litany; and the whole prayer
                being
                ended,
                they bowed
                their heads
                under the Bishops
                hands,
                by whom
                they were
                dismissed
                with a Benediction, conform unto the Canon of the</hi>
                Laodicean <hi>Council, which before we
                spake
                of. Which done,
                the Deacon standing
                as before, said
                thus,</hi> , Depart ye
                <hi>Catechumeni</hi> in peace. (<hi>The</hi> Ite missa
                est, <hi>in the</hi> Western <hi>Churches,
                is
                the same with this.</hi>) <hi>Then
                follow
                prayers
                for the</hi> Engergumeni, <hi>or such as
                were
                possessed
                with unclean spirits:
                And that being
                ended,
                together with another for the Baptized
                or</hi> Illuminati, <hi>the Deacon
                said,</hi>
                , <hi>Pray ye
                devoutly
                which be under Penance; and then

              <hi>Pray we for those which be under Penance, that God
                would shew
                them
                the way of repentance, accept
                their Recantation and Confession, and
                finally
                beat down Satan under their feet,</hi>

                mercy on them.
                Thus much and more unto this purpose in the
                Constitutions.
                And I the rather am
                inclined
                to admit these Forms,
                or to resolve it at the least, that set
                Forms
                they had
                for these several Offices;
                because the Minister by whom
                they were
                performed,
                was
                of no higher
                Order than a Deacon. For had
                the prayers
                been
                left to the discretion or ability of
                him
                that made
                them,
                assuredly,
                the <hi>Bishop</hi> or the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                being
                men
                of greater
                gifts,
                and more practised
                in them
                than the <hi>Deacons</hi>
                were
                supposed
                to be, would not have left a business of that weight and
                moment to be discharged
                by men
                of the lowest
                Order, themselves attending
                on the service, as if not concerned.
                And so much for,
              
              
              
              and on occasion of the so Celebrated
                Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> one of the
                ancientest
                upon true record, in the Church of Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              You see by this,
              
              that in the time of the renowned
                <hi>Constantine,</hi> and long time before, the Church
                was
                sorted
                and disposed
                into ranks
                and files;
                and every sort of men
                had
                a particular Form of Service fitted
                and framed
                thereunto, besides
                those Common-prayers
                wherein all did
                joyn.
                We will next see whether they were
                not in condition, as well to amplifie
                the times,
                and beautifie
                the places
                of Gods
                publick
                worship, as to agree upon the Forms;
                and then we will go forwards
                in our purposed
                search, till we have set the business above all
                gain-saying.
                And for the times
                we shewed
                before, with what a general consent they
                had
                transferred
                the <hi>Jewish Sabbath,</hi> on the which God
                rested,
                unto the first day of the week, on the which Christ rose.
                Nor was
                it long before
                they had
                their daily meetings,
                and thereon their set hours
                of Prayer, Morning and Evening, as
                was
                proved
                before from S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                words.
                To which was
                after added,
                as appeareth
                by the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> before
                remembred,
                an
                hour of prayer at nine of the Clock,
              
              , saith
                the Text; which hours
                are still observed
                at nine of the Clock, ,
                saith
                the Text; which hours
                are still observed
                in all the Cathedrals
                of this Kingdom. Besides
                these, as their numbers
                multiplied,
                and their affairs
                were
                crowned
                by God with peace and happiness, they
                instituted
                several Annual Festivals
                to be observed
                with greater
                solemnity and concourse of people, than any of their
                ordinary Assemblies,
                in memory of especial blessings
                which God had
                given
                them
                by his Son, or conferred
                on them
                by his Saints.
                Of these, the Feasts
                of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi>
                as they are most eminent, so they are most
                antient,
                as being
                instituted
                in the times
                of the Lords
                Apostles;
                to which were
                added
                in short time, the two days
                next following,
                that so those seacred Festivals
                might be solemnized
                with the greater
                measure of devotion; in which regard, <hi>Easter</hi>
                is
                called
                by <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi>
              
              , or the three
                days
                Feast. See of this also, <hi>Augustin de Civitate
                Dei,</hi> l. 22. cap. 8. The Feast of Christis Nativity,
                began
                if not before, in the second Age. <hi>Theophilus
                Caesariensis,</hi> who lived
                about the times
                of <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi>
                makes
                mention of it, and placeth
                it on the 25th. of <hi>December, quocunque die</hi> 8.
                <hi>Calend. Januar.
                venerit,</hi> so his own words
                are, as we still observe it. A Festival of so great
                erninency, that <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                entituleth
                it , the mother or <hi>Metropolis</hi>
                of all other Feasts.
              
              See for this also in <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> where it will be
                found to have been
                universally
                received
                before the time of <hi>Dioclesians</hi>
                persecution; who burnt many eminent
                Christians
                at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> whilst they
                were
                Celebrating
                this great Festival in the House God.
              
              That of the Incarnation was
                ordained
                in the beginning
                of the third Century, there being
                an
                Homily of <hi>Gregory</hi> surnamed
                <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi>
                who lived,
                <hi>An.</hi>
                230. entituled
                <hi>de Annunciatione
                B. Virginis;</hi> another (for of this there
                is
                made
                some question) writ by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who
                lived
                in the beginning
                of the following
                Age, whereof there is
                no doubt amongst Learned
                men.
                That of the <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> as
                we call it now, is
                of the same Antiquity, as the other
                was;
                for we find mention of it in the
                Books
                of <hi>Origen.</hi>
              
              And for the Feasts
                of the Apostles,
                Evangelists,
                and other blessed
                Saints
                of God, they took
                beginning
                most of them
                in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who by his Edict
                gave
                command to all the Deputies
                and Lieutenants
                of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that the
                memorials
                of the Martyrs
                should be duely
                honoured,
              
              and solemn Feasts
                to be appointed
                for that end and purpose, most of which
                brought
                their Fasts
                or Vigils
                along with them.
                The Church lost
                nothing of that power by our Saviours
                coming,
                which she enjoyed
                and practised
                in the times
                before; but did
                ordain both Feasts
                and Fasts
                too, if she saw
                occasion, and as she found it might
                conduce to
                the advantage of Gods
                publique
                worship. Now as the Christians
                of these two Ages
                did
                augment the Times,
                so they increased
                the places
                also of Gods
                publique
                worship. In
                the first Age they had
                their meeting
                or Assemblies
                in some privage Houses,
                which being
                separated
                from all profane and common use,
                were
                by the Owners
                dedicated
                to Religious exercises,
                and therefore honoured
                in the Scriptures
                with the name of Churches.
                But as they grew
                in numbers,
                so they grew
                in confidence, and in these Ages
                had
                their Churches
                visible and obvious to the eyes
                of all men.
                Witness hereto <hi>Ignatius</hi> the
                Apostles
                Scholar, and Successor to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the See of
                <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived
                in the beginning
                of the second Century, and writing
                to the <hi>Magnesians</hi> (an
                Epistle hitherto unquestioned by our modern
                <hi>Criticks</hi>)
                doth exhort them
                thus: <hi>Omnes ad orandum in idem loci convenite,</hi>
              
              <hi>una sit communis precatio, una mens, una spes in
                charitate,</hi> c. That is
                to say, Assemble all together in the same place, to pour
                fourth your prayers
                unto the Lord, let there be one Common-prayer amongst you,
                one mind, one onely
                hope, in love and an
                unblamable faith in Jesus Christ, <hi>run all together as
                one man to the Temple
              
              
              of God, as to one Altar, as to Jesus Christ, the High
                Priest of the uncreated
                and immortal God.</hi> Witness hereto for the middle of
                this second Century, two several
                Epistles
                of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the first, (and those unquestioned
                hitherto) which we shall have occasion to make use of in
                the last Chapter of this Tract, and the sixth Section of
                that Chapter. And finally,
                witness hereunto for the close thereof, these
                words
                of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>
                where speaking
                of the spiritual Church, or the Congregation of
                Gods
                Elect, he doth phrase it thus. .
              
              I call not now (saith
                he) the place but the Congregation of
                Gods
                Elect by the name of the Church. By which it
                is
                mosT plain and evident, that the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi>
                or the Church, signified
                in his time, as well the place of the
                Assembly,
                as the general body of the Congregation, or Elect of God.
                Now that these Churches
                mentioned
                by <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the first
                beginning,
                and specially
                by <hi>Clemens</hi> in the latter end of this second
                Century, were
                not only some rooms
                in particular houses,
                or the whole houses
                of some men
                dedicated
                and applyed
                to Religious offices,
                will appear most plainly
                by that of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> in the
                following
                Age, where he divides
                the Churches
                extant in his time into five parts
                or distributions,
              
              according
                to the remoter
                or nearer
                admission then given
                to Penitents;
                a distribution which few houses
                built
                for private uses,
                though afterwards
                dedicated
                to Gods
                service, and no one room in any house could be capable of.
                But it appeareth
                more plainly,
                by that great number of Churches
                or places
                of Gods
                publique
                worship, which either were
                destroyed
                or taken
                from the Christians
                in the persecution of <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> and
                restored
                again by <hi>Galienus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>
                Emperors;
                for which consult <hi>Eusebius, Hist, eccl. lib.</hi> 7.
                <hi>cap.</hi> 12. But it appeareth
                most plainly
                by another passage in the said
                <hi>Eusebius,</hi> where speaking
                of the peaceable times
                which the Church enjoyed
                immediatly
                before the Persecution raised
                by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> he tells
                us of the <hi>Christians.
                Antiquis illis aedificiis haud quaquam amplius
                contenti,</hi>
              
              <hi>amplas spatiosasque in omnibus urbibus ex fundamentis
                erexerunt ecclesias.</hi> That is
                to say, That not contenting
                themselves longer
                with those <hi>antient
                edifices</hi>
                which had
                been
                built
                unto their hands
                in the times
                forgoing,
                they erected
                large and goodly Churches
                from the very foundation in all the
                Cities
                of the Empire. By which last evidence, it
                appeareth
                that the Christians
                had
                in most Cities,
                some Churches
                or places
                of Assembly
                of an
                old erection, as old perhaps as the last
                times
                of the Apostles;
                and that those old erections
                being
                grown
                unable to contain their multitudes,
                they were
                necessitated
                to build new ones
                of a larger
                size, and of capacity proportionable to such infinite
                numbers.
                Which places
                of Assembly,
                as they first called
                <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> as they also
                did
                the Congregation of Assembly
                it self; so in the middle of this Age, they
                began
                to be called
                <hi>Dominicae</hi> by the <hi>Latines,</hi>
                and in the same signification by the
                <hi>Greeks
                Kuriacae,</hi> from which last word, the <hi>English</hi>
                word Church, and the <hi>Kirk</hi> of the
                <hi>Scots,</hi>
                are very probably
                supposed
                to have been
                derived.
                From this time forwards
                the Christians
                spared
                no cost to adorn their Churches,
                the Fabricks
                more magnificent than they had
                been
                formerly,
                the Ornaments
                within proportionable to the outward
                beauties,
                the Altars
                furnished
                with rich plate, even to the envy and astonishment of the
                spightful
                <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                Insomuch as <hi>Felix</hi> a Pro-consul, in the time of
                <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> a little after the
                middle of the following
                Century, at such time as the Churches
                were
                given
                up unto spoil and rapine, is
                said
                to have cryed
                out on the sight thereof, . That
                is
                to say, <hi>Behold, in what rich
                Vessels
                they administer to the Son of</hi> Mary. So little
                was
                it thought in those happy times,
                that there should one day come a
                generation
                of men
                professing
                piety, who should deface those Altars,
                and destroy those Temples,
                and cry, <hi>Down with them,
                down with them
                even to the ground.</hi> But of this great increase of
                Churches,
                with their Solemnities
                and Forms
                of Dedication, we shall speak more hereafter in the close
                of all.

              WE are now come nto the setled
                ages
                of the Church,
              
              when she had
                got
                the better of Idolatry, and stood
                no more in fear of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                fury: and so in probability are like to see a fuller and
                more perfect view of her publick
                Forms;
                than in those more remote and dangerous
                times,
                in which she durst
                not stand so much in the open light. The
                times
                from <hi>Constantine</hi> unto S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                were
                the most glorious and triumphant, that ever
                were
                beheld
                by the militant Church: within which compass we intend to
                contain our selves,
                and to conclude the search which we have in hand. And
                first we meet with <hi>Cyril,</hi> a right godly Bishop,
                who in his <hi>mystagogical Orations</hi>
                made
                by him
                in his younger
                years,
              
              upon the Rites
                and Mysteries
                of the holy Church, presents
                us with such pieces
                of the ancient Liturgies
                (that of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                especially)
                that by them
                we are well assured
                of the whole, that some such there
                were,
                though we are so unfortunate not to have
                them
                now. The first contains
                the Rites
                of Baptism, in which it is
                declared,
                that those who are admitted
                to it, . <hi>Being
                brought
                within the porch unto the place of Baptism, and
                standing
                with their aces
                towards
                the</hi> West, <hi>are commaned
                to stretch forth their hands,
                and to desie the Devil, as if present by
                them.
                The Form of which defiance or</hi> Abrenunciation <hi>he
                delivereth
                thus,</hi>
              
              Renuntio tibi Satana,  omnibus
                tuis operibus,  omni pompae illius (<hi>or</hi> tuae
                <hi>rather</hi>)  omni tuo cultui; <hi>the very same
                with that which we have seen
                before of the former times.
                This done,
                the party which is
                to be baptized,</hi>
                , <hi>being
                turned
                from the</hi> West <hi>towrads the</hi> East,
                <hi>is
                bid to say,</hi> Credo in patrem,  filium, 
                spiritum sanctum,  in baptisma
                poenitentiae. <hi>That is
                to say, I believe in the Father; and in the Son, and in
                the holy Ghost, and in the baptism of repentance. This
                said,
                and being
                brought
                further into the Church,</hi> ,
              
              <hi>they put off their cloaths,
                to shew,
                that they put off the</hi> old man <hi>with all his
                works:
                and being
                thus naked are anointed
                with the holy Chrism. Thence being
                brought
                unto the Font</hi> () <hi>every one of
                them
                is
                interrogated
                whether he doth believe in the name of the Father, and of
                the Son, and of the holy Ghost: and
                having
                made
                confession of thehir faith (according
                as we saw
                before from the Constitutions)
                they were
                thrice dipped
                into the water, in memory of our
                Saviours
                lying
                in the grace three days,
                (the formal words
                of Baptism, being
                therewithal pronounced,
                though not here expressed.)
                Which done,
                the party is
                again anointed
                on the forehead,
                nostrils,</hi>
              
              <hi>ears,
                and breasts,
                (upon the reasons
                there declared)</hi>
                , <hi>and cloathed
                in white garments;</hi>
              
              <hi>which concludes
                the action.</hi> But here it is
                to be observed,
                that this last anointing
                was
                in the way of confirmation: it being
                the custom of those times,
                in the baptizing
                of all such as were
                <hi>Adulti,</hi> or of riper
                years,
              
              
              to minister both <hi>Baptism</hi> and
                <hi>Confirmation</hi> at the same time, as our
                incomparable <hi>Hooke</hi>
                rightly
                noteth.
                And note withal that in the anointing
                of the forehead in his later
                Unction,
              
              the party baptized
                was
                signed
                with the sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> ,
                as the Father there. Which is
                no more than that so celebrated
                passage of <hi>Tertullian, Caro signatur ut anims
                muniatur,</hi> declares
                to be the antient
                and unquestionable practice of the Church of
                <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Next for the celebration of the Eucharist, he
                describes
                it thus.
              
              Things
                being
                in readiness, the Deacon bringeth water for the
                hands
                to the chief Minister,
              
              , <hi>and to the
                Priests
                that stand about the Altar, and then
                saith
                aloud,</hi> Complectimini  osculemini vos invicem,
                <hi>embrace and kiss ye one another; which
                is
                done
                accordingly;
                and this in token of that Union both of
                hearts
                and souls,
                which is
                and ought to be between them.
                Then saith
                the Priests,</hi>
                Sursum corda,
                <hi>or,</hi> Lift up your hearts;
                <hi>the people answer,</hi> We lift
                them
                up unto the Lord: <hi>The Priest again,</hi> Let us give
                thanks
                unto the Lord; <hi>the people say,</hi> Dignum 
                justum est, <hi>or,</hi> It is
                meet and right so to do. And by this place (I note this
                only by the way) we make up the breach in S.
                <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy, being
                the antient
                Liturgy of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                as before was
                said:
                which breach we shewed
                and touched
                at <hi>obiter,</hi> in the former Chapter.
                , c. <hi>Then
                (saith
                he) we make mention of Heaven, Earth, and Sea, and all the
                Creatures
                reasonable and unreasonable, and also of the
                Angels
                and Archangels,
                and the Powers
                of Heaven, praising
                God and saying,</hi>
                Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus Sabbati. <hi>By
                which celestial Hymns
                we do not only sanctifie
                our selves,
                but beseech our good and gracious God, that he would send
                his holy Spirit on the gifts
                presented,
                (that is
                to say, the Bread and Wine) that so the Bread may be
                made
                the Body of Christ, and the Wine his Blood. Then do we
                call upon the Lord,</hi> , <hi>for the
                general peace of all the Churches,
                the tranquillity of all the World, for
                Princes
                and their Armies,
                for our Friends
                and Brethren,
                for all that be in need, sickness, or any other adversity,
                and in a word, for every one that
                wanteth
                help from the hands
                of God.</hi> The rest that followeth
                as a part of this general
                Prayer, upon the alteration of the Form and Person,
                <hi>viz.</hi> from , <hi>We call upon
                the Lord,</hi> in the <hi>third</hi> person, unto
                 in the <hi>second</hi> person;
                is
                most judiciously
                concluded
                by Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi>
              
              to be the fraud and forgery of some Impostor: whose
                judgment
                in the same I heartily
                both applaud and follow. But to proceed with that which
                is
                received
                for true and genuine, and of unquestionble
                credit. This general Prayer being
                thus concluded,
                followe
                tht at, ,
              
              which Christ our Saviour gave
                unto his Disciples;
                the <hi>Lords
                Prayer</hi> he means:
                and meaning
                so, shews
                plainly
                that the Church conceived
                how the Lords
                Prayer was
                given
                to be said
                and used,
                not to be imitated
                only. <hi>Then saith
                the Priest thus,</hi> Sancta Sanctis, <hi>unto the holy
                all things
                are holy, or holy things
                are for holy persons;
                the people answering,</hi>
                Unus sanctus, unus Dominus, JESUS CHRISTUS, <hi>That
                is
                to say, there is
                but one Holy, one Lord, JESUS CHRIST. Then sangt the
                Priest the divine Hymns,
                exhorting
                you to the communion of the holy
                Mysteries,
                and saying,</hi>
                Gustate  videte quam fuavis est Dominus. <hi>O taste
                and see how good the Lord is.
                This said,
                they came
                to the Communion, not with their
                hands
                spread out, nor disjoyned
                singers,
                but with the left hand placed
                under the right, receiving
                the Lord's body in the palms
                of their hands
                (lest any of the consecrated
                Bread should fall to the ground;) and therewith</hi> (viz.
                <hi>to the Priests
                prayer when he gave
                the same</hi>) <hi>each one said</hi>
                AMEN. <hi>After they had
                received
                the Communion of the Body of CHRIST, they
                received
                the Cup also of his Blood (where still we have the whole
                Communion,</hi> sub utraque specie, <hi>what ever new
                Doctrines
                have been
                coyned
                at</hi> Rome) <hi>not stretching
                out the hands,</hi>
                , <hi>but falling
                down, as when Men
                are in the Act of Worship or Adoration, they
                said</hi>
                AMEN, <hi>as formerly
                at the receiving
                of the Bread.</hi> . <hi>Last of all,
                tarrying
                for the parting
                or concluding
                Prayers,
                they gave
                thanks
                to God, who had
                vouchsafed
                to make them
                worthy of his holy Mysteries.</hi>
                This was
                the course, and these the footsteps
                of the Forms
                observed
                of old times
                in the Mother Church, the holy City of
                <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                And if we may conjecture
                <hi>ex pede Herculem,</hi> what the
                dimensions
                were
                of the body of <hi>Hercules,</hi> by the proportion of his
                foot; we may be well conjecture by these evident
                footsteps,
                what the whole bodies
                were
                of the antient
                Liturgies.
            </p>
            <p>
              From <hi>Cyril</hi> on unto St. <hi>Basil,</hi> another
                famous Bishop of the <hi>Eastern</hi>
                Churches.
              
              Who having
                made
                some Rules
                for the better order of those who
                did
                intend to lead a Monastick
                life; and being
                accused
                that in the singing
                of the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                and
              
              
              
              regulating
                the manner of that Melody, he had
                somewhat innovated,
                contrary to the received
                custom of the Church: was
                forced
                to make his own Apology, and send it to the Clergy of
                <hi>Neo-Caesarea.</hi>
              
              Thus then saith
                he, , c. <hi>The
                Rites
                (saith
                he) which we observe amongst us, are such as are agreeable
                and consonant to all the Churches
                of God. Our people rising
                in the night do before day repair unto the
                Chappel
                or house of Prayer: and having
                made
                confession of their sins
                to God, in sorrow, tears,
                and great compunction of the Soul, they rise at last from
                Prayer, and take themselves unto the
                Psalms.
                Being
                divided
                into two parts,
                they sing as it were
                in turns,
                one second another, or Quirewise
                (as is
                used
                in our Cathedrals)
                so taking
                time to meditate on the words
                of God, and therewithal making
                our hearts
                and minds
                more attent thereto. Then one to
                whom
                that charge or Office appertained,
                began
                some other Psalm or Hymn; and all
                sung
                together after him:
                by which variety of singing,</hi>
                , <hi>some Prayers
                being
                interserted
                or mingled
                with it, they past over the night: and on the
                dawning
                of the day, all of them
                joyned
                together,</hi> , <hi>as if they
                had
                but one heart and one mouth amongst
                them,
                and sung
                unto God a Psalm of Confession (most likely one of the
                seven penitential Psalms;)
                and after every one made
                in his own words
                a profession of his penitence; and so all
                returned.</hi>
                Where note, that howsoever this Form of Service
                was
                fitted
                only for a company of private Men,
                who had
                embraced
                the Monastick
                life; and to be used
                only by them
                in their private Oratories:
                yet the most part thereof was
                borrowed
                from the publick
                Forms,
                at that time extant in the Church. Of the which
                Rites
                or Forms
                retained
                amongst them,
                were
                the beginning
                of their service with a confession of their
                sins,
                then p rayers to God, and then the
                singing
                of the Psalms.
                That which was
                singular herein, and needed
                the Apology, was
                that they met
                together before day, and spent
                more time upon the Psalmody, than in
                reading,
                or preaching
                of the Word, or in Common-prayer, or any of the other
                parts
                of publick
                Worship. <hi>Basil</hi> could tell as well as any, wherein
                the Form of Service
                used
                amongst his Monks,
                agreed
                with that which was
                received
                and used
                in publick
                Churches;
                and wherein it differed:
                as having
                took
                the pains
                to compose a Liturgie,
                or rather to compleat
                and polish, and fit unto the publick
                use, such as had
                formerly
                been
                extant. And though that Copy of it which
                occurs
                in the <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi>
                and in the writings
                of <hi>Cassander,</hi>
                have some things
                in it which are found to be of a latter date; yet we shall
                clear that doubt anon, when we come to
                <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                against whose Liturgy I find the like
                Objections.
                Mean time take this of <hi>Basil</hi> for a pregnant
                Argument, that in his time, and long before it, the
                Service of the Chruch
                was
                not only ordered
                by Rules
                and Rubricks;
                but put into set Forms
                of Worship: which we have noted
                in his Books
                <hi>De spiritu sancto,</hi> and
                is
                this that followeth.
                For speaking
                there touching
                those publick
                Usages
                which came
                into the Church from the tradition of the
                Apostles,
              
              he instanceth
                in these particulars.
                , c. <hi>The
                signing
                with the sign of the Cross all those who place their
                hopes
                in Christ, what writing
                teacheth?
                that in our prayers
                we should turn towards
                the</hi> East, <hi>where is
                it taught
                us in the Scripture? And then,</hi> ,
                <hi>Those words
                of invocation wherewithal in the holy</hi> Eucharist
                <hi>we consecrate
                the Bread, and Cup of Benediction, which of those
                blessed
                Saints
                have left in writing?
                For not content with those things
                which the Apostles
                or the Gospel have committed
                to us, many things
                have been
                added
                since, both in the way of preface and of conclusion, which
                are derived
                from unwritten Tradition---</hi> And not long after thus
                of <hi>Baptism,</hi> having
                first spoke
                of consecrating
                the Water, of the Chrism or Oyl,
                and the three Dippings
                then in use: Those other things,
                saith
                he, which are done
                in Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> , the
                <hi>Abrenuntiation</hi> which is
                made
                to Satan and to all his Angels,
                out of what Scripture is
                it brought?
            </p>
            <p>
              Next for S. <hi>Cyrsostom,</hi>
              
              the evidence we have from him
                is
                beyond exception. , c.
              
              <hi>It is
                no now, saith
                he, as in the old Testament, wherein the
                Priests
                eat this, and the people that: it
                being
                unlawful for the people to eat those
                things
                which were
                permitted
                to the Priest. It is
                now otherwise with us. For unto all
                is
                the same Body, and the same Cup
                presented.
                And in our very prayers
                it is
                easily
                seen,
                how much we attribute unto the people.</hi>
                , c. <hi>For both those who are
                possessed
                with the devil, the</hi> Energumeni, <hi>and those who yet
                are under penance, both by the People and Priest</hi>
                () <hi>common
                Prayers
                are made:
                and we say all one and the self same Prayer, even that
                which is
                so full of mercy.</hi> Where by the way, though in the
                <hi>Greek</hi> it be, , they say all
              
              
              one Prayer, yet in the <hi>Latin</hi> it
                runs
                thus, <hi>omnes unam eandemque precem concipiunt:</hi>
                which would make well for unpremeditated and extemporary
                Prayers,
                if it were
                possible that all the Congregation, both Priest and
                people, should fall upon the same conception. But to go
                on.  c. <hi>Again,
                saith
                he,</hi>
              <hi>when we repell
                all such from the holy Rayls,
                which cannot be partakers
                of the holy Table: there is
                another Prayer to be said,
                and we all lie alike upon the ground, and all rise
                together.
                Then when the Peace (or sign of peace)
                is
                mutually
                to be given,
                and taken,
                we do all equally
                salute (or kiss) each other. Thus also in the celebration
                of the sacred Mysteries,
                as the Priest prayeth
                for the people, so do they for him:
                these usual words,</hi>
                , And with thy Spirit,
                <hi>importing
                nothing else but this. And finally,</hi>
              
              <hi>that Prayer, wherein we give
                thanks
                to the Lord our God, is
                common unto both alike: the Priest not only
                giving
                thanks
                to God, but the whole Assembly.
                For when he hath
                demanded
                their suffrage first, and they acknowledg
                thereupon,</hi> ,
              
              <hi>that</hi> it is
                meet and right so to do, <hi>then he
                begins
                the holy</hi> Eucharist. <hi>Nor
                is
                it strange, nor should it seem so unto any, that the
                people should thus hold conference with the Priest o
                Minister, considering
                that they sing those holy Hymns,
                together with the Cherubins,
                and the powers
                of Heaven.</hi> So he. And all this out of question,
              
              must needs
                be understood
                of prescribed
                Forms,
                such as the people said
                by heart, or could read in Books
                that either lay before them,
                or were
                brought
                with them:
                such as they were
                so throughly
                versed
                in, as to make answer to the Minister upon all
                occasions.
                For what else were
                those common Prayers,
                those  which he
                speaks
                of; what else that , that one
                self-same Prayer, that Prayer so full of mercy in which
                all did
                joyn?
                were
                they not so determinate the prescribed
                that all could say them
                with the Minister? And were
                not those returns
                and Answers,
                so prescribed
                and set, that all the people knew
                their <hi>Q.</hi> and were
                not ignorant of their turn, when they
                were
                to speak? Several other passages
                of the antient
                Liturgies,
                might here and there be gathered
                from this Fathers
                writings,
                if one would take the pains
                to seek them.
                But I shall save that pains
                at present, and indeed well may. For what need search be
                made
                for pieces,
                when we have the whole, a whole and perfect
                Liturgie
                of this Fathers
                making:
                unless it be to shew
                of what antient
                pieces
                the whole work is
                made.
            </p>
            <p>
              For in the <hi>Bibliothecae Paetrum</hi> in the
                writings
                of <hi>Cassander,</hi>
              
              and in the great collection
                of this Fathers
                works,
                published
                by the honoured
                and admired
                Sir <hi>Henry Savil;</hi> there
                is
                an
                entire Liturgie,
                which bears
                his name. . So it
                is
                entituled.
              
              The like we find under S. <hi>Basils</hi> name, both in
                <hi>Cassanders</hi>
                writings,
                and the <hi>Bibliotheca.</hi> The question
                is,
                Whether they are the works
                of those, whose names
                they carry. For my part, I conceive they are, for the main
                and substance, though not without some
                abstractions
                and additions
                in the change of times:
                and hope that when such Arguments
                are answered,
                which are produced
                unto the contrary, it will appear so unto others. And
                first for that of <hi>Basil,</hi> it
                is
                objected
                by <hi>Hospinian, Veterem translationem
                cum Graeco exemplari,  nova
                versione
                non convenire:</hi>
              
              That the old translation agrees
                not either with the new, or the <hi>Greek</hi>
                Originals.
                Assuredly,
                a very gentle Argument, such as will do no hurt at all to
                any understanding
                Disputant; and therefore
                purposely
                omitted,
                as I think by Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> who in his censure of
                those Liturgies
                did
                consult that Author. And yet this
                is
                the only argument of moment which
                is
                made
                against it: which being
                so gentle as it is
                would require no answer. Or if it
                did,
                and that the difference of translations
                from one another, or if the old
                translation
                from the <hi>Greek</hi> Original, be a sufficient argument
                to discharge this Liturgy; there could not very many
                works
                of the old <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers
                be affirmed
                for theirs: their old translations
                being
                so incongruous, so manifestly
                different from the Authors
                mind, as by continual observation they are found to be.
                The next Objection, if it may be
                called
                so, is
                of a gentler
                strain than this: it being
                charged
                also by <hi>Hospinian,</hi>
                that in the commemoration of the dead, <hi>Basilii 
                Chrysostomi
                nomen legitur,</hi>
              
              the names
                of <hi>Basil</hi> who must alive, when he
                made
                this Liturgy, and that of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                who lived
                after him,
                do both occur. But there is
                no such matter to be found in the Original, extant in the
                <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> nor the translation of the
                same thereunto annexed:
                which plainly
                shews
                the old translation (if thence the
                Argument
                were
                taken)
                did
                differ very much from the genuine Copy.
                Besides,
                the same Objection being
                made
                against the Liturgy of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> we shall
                there meet with it; for there indeed the same
                commemoration is
                to be found. Besides
                which, it is
                noted
                by <hi>Hospinian</hi> also, that in this Liturgy there
                is
                this prayer for Pope <hi>Nicolas.
                Nicolai
              
              
              
              Sanctiffimi  universalis Papae, longa sint
                tempora;</hi> whereas Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi>
                lived
                not (saith
                he) till the year 857. which was
                500 years
                after <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> death; and that there
                is
                a prayer for the Emperour
                <hi>Alexius,</hi> the first of which name
                began
                his Reign, <hi>An.</hi>
                1080. and not before.
              
              To which we say, that neither in the Copy extant in the
                <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> nor in that
                published
                by Sir <hi>H. Savil,</hi> are either of these two last
                errors
                to be found, which shews
                they came
                not out of the Originals.
                Secondly,
                That possibly
                the business of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> may be nothing but a
                meer
                mistake: For whereas he that published
                that old translation, which as it
                seems
                <hi>Hospinian</hi> met
                with, had
                found <hi>Sanctissimi
                 universalis Papae N.</hi> (which <hi>N.</hi> we know
                is
                used
                indefinitely
                for  in the <hi>Greek</hi>) he out of
                his abundant ignorance of a <hi>Nicolas Nemo,</hi>
                makes
                Pope <hi>Nicolas.</hi> Or had
                it been
                Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> in the antient
                Copies,
                <hi>Hospinian,</hi> who objects
                the same, might with small search have found some
                <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
                of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of that very name; and they we
                know did
                use to call themselves Universal
                Bishops,
                for 'twas the thing which <hi>Gregory</hi> the great so
                stomached
                in them.
                But then it will be said,
                that every one of those <hi>Nicolai</hi>
                lived
                after <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was
                dead; and that <hi>Alexius</hi>
                was
                not Emperour
                until 700 years
                after his decease. Most true, for every man of
                sence
                must needs
                conceive, that the names
                of Emperours
                and Patriarchs
                must needs
                be changed,
                as the old die, and new Successors
                come in place: Or else we should collect
                an
                excellent
                Argument for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
                finding
                prayers
                for the deceased
                in S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Liturgy. Might not one say as
                well, that certainly,
                the Liturgy now used
                and established
                in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                is
                not the same which was
                set forth and published
                in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
                Reign, because the name of our dread
                Soveraign
                Lord K. <hi>Charles</hi> doth occur therein; and that
                there is
                a prayer in it for Q. <hi>Mary</hi> and the Royal Issue?
              
              But finally,
                it is
                objected
                by <hi>Hospinian,</hi> and this as well as that
                <hi>Rivet</hi> builds
                on also, that <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> in a Letter to the
                <hi>Ravennates,</hi> saith
                that the Liturgy
                used
                in the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                was
                that of <hi>Basil,</hi> and not <hi>Chrysostoms: Quod
                mirum esset si Chrysostomus ejus Ecclesiae Archiepiscopus,
                Liturgiam composursset;</hi> which
                had
                been
                strange saith
                <hi>Rivet,</hi> if <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> which
                was
                Archbishop of that City, had
                composed
                a Liturgy. However, by their own confession we have a
                Liturgy of S. <hi>basils</hi> making,
                and that it is
                somewhat worth the having;
                and it shall go exceeding
                hard but we will have another of S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi>
                also. For it is
                noted
                to my hand by our Learned
                <hi>Brerewood,</hi> from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> a late Patriarch
                of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that in the <hi>Greek</hi>
                Churches
                or Festivals
                they use the antient
                Liturgy of <hi>Basil,</hi> and on common
                days
                that of <hi>Chrysostom.</hi>
              
              By which it seems
                that <hi>carolus Calvus,</hi> or whosoever
                gave
                him
                that intelligence, was
                an
                Holy-day man; and took
                no notice of the Service of that Church upon common
                days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus have we found two Liturgies
                for the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches,
              
              both made
                within the compass of the first four hundred
                years
                from our Saviours
                Birth; and with the proof of this we might here sit down,
                and not be put to further travail; but that I think the
                <hi>Western</hi> Church would not take it well, if we
                should leave her worse provided
                than the <hi>Eastern</hi> was.
                Now that there were
                by this time, and before, set and
                established
                Forms
                of prayer in the <hi>Western</hi>
                parts,
                is
                evident by those remainders
                or fragments
                of them,
                which we produced
                from <hi>Cyprian</hi> for the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi>
                from <hi>Justin</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for the
                Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> both which, though born in other
                Countreys,
                yet did
                live there most. Which Liturgy, that I mean of
                <hi>Rome,</hi> as it might have
                its
                first grounds
                from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whose name it
                carrieth;
                so were
                there many helping
                hands
                put to it, in succeeding
                times,
                to make up the work. Of which thus <hi>Platina.</hi>
              
              <hi>Nuda primo haec erant  omnia simpliciter
                tractabantur.</hi> Petrus <hi>enim ubi
                conseeraverat
                oratione</hi>
                Pater noster, <hi>usus erat. Auxit haec mysteria</hi>
                Jacobus <hi>Episcopus Hierosolymitanus;
                auxit</hi> Basilius, <hi>auxere  alii. Nam Celestinus
                missae introitum dedit,</hi> Gregorius
                <hi>KYRIE-ELEISON, Gloria in excelsis</hi> Telesphorus,
                <hi>c.</hi> These things,
                saith
                he, at first were
                but plain and naked. For <hi>Peter</hi> when he
                Consecrated,
                used
                the <hi>Pater noster; James</hi> Bishop of
                <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                much increased
                the mysteries;
                the like did
                <hi>Basil</hi> and some others. <hi>Celestine</hi>
                made
                the <hi>Introite, Gregory</hi> added
                to it the <hi>Kyrie eleison, Telesphorus</hi>
                the <hi>Gloria in excelsis, Xistus</hi> the first, put to
                it the <hi>trisagion,</hi> or, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord
                God of Hosts;
                Gelasius</hi> the <hi>Collations,</hi>
                (perhaps the <hi>Collects.</hi>)
                The Gospel and Epistle were
                brought
                in by <hi>Hierom,</hi> the <hi>Allelujah</hi>
                borrowed
                from <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                the Creed from the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> the
                Commemoration of the dead by Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the
                kissing
                of the Pax by <hi>Innocent</hi> the first; and <hi>Agnus
                Dei</hi> was
                not sung,
                saith
                he, till the time of <hi>Sergius.</hi> If so, then as not
                <hi>Rome</hi> it self, so neither
                was
                the Liturgy of <hi>Rome</hi> made
                in one day. It took
                up longer
                time than so, to come unto that bulk and greatness, in
              
              
              which now it stands.
                But out of doubt a Liturgy it had
                in the best times
                of it: So had
                the Church of <hi>Millain,</hi>
                those of <hi>France, Spain, England;</hi> not every where
                the same, nor much different from it. <hi>Facies non
                omnibus una, Nec diversa tamen, qualem decet esse
                Sororum,</hi> as once the Poet said
                in another case. And so it stood
                until the <hi>Western</hi> Empire
                was
                conferred
                on the Kings
                of <hi>France,</hi> who by their power, and the
                importunity of the Popes
                of <hi>Rome,</hi> setled
                the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Gregorian Missal</hi> over all
                the West. Till those times
                they had
                several Liturgies,
                as before was
                said.
                That of the Church of <hi>Millain,</hi>
                called
                commonly
                <hi>Officium Ambrosianum,</hi> not because
                made
                by him
                originally,
                but because he reduced
                it to a better and more setled
                Form, is
                extant still, and used
                by special sufferance in the Church of
                <hi>Millain</hi>
                to this very day. So also for the
                antient
                Liturgy of the Church of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they call
                the <hi>Mosarabick</hi> Liturgy,
              
              which received
                great increase both for Form and Order from <hi>Isidorus
                Hispalensis,</hi> and therefore
                is
                most commonly
                ascribed
                to him;
                it is
                still used
                in <hi>Toledo</hi> by the like permission.
              
              By whom
                the Liturgy of <hi>Spain</hi> was
                first composed
                or setled,
                it is
                hard to say; that Countrey
                yielding
                but few Writers,
                whose works
                have come unto our hands;
                But sure a Liturgy they had,
                long time before the birth of <hi>Isidore,</hi> and that
                most punctually
                observed
                in the Cathedrals
                or Mother-Churches.
                From which, when the <hi>Parochial</hi>
                Churches
                began
                to vary, as it seems
                they did,
                the Council of <hi>Girona,</hi> (<hi>Concilium
                Gerundense</hi> the <hi>Latines</hi>
                call it) <hi>An.</hi>
                517. recalled
                them
                to their antient
                duty; enjoyning
                them
                to hold conformity in all the acts
                of publick
                worship with the Mother-Church, the chief Cathedral of the
                Province; and that as well for the order of the service,
                the <hi>Psalmody,</hi> the <hi>Canon,</hi> as the use and
                custom of the ministration.
              
              <hi>Sicut in Metropolitana Ecclesia agitur, ita in Dei
                nomine, in omni Tarraconensi Provincia,
                tum ipsius Missae ordo, quam psallendi vel ministrandi
                consuetudo servetur.</hi> So the
                Fathers
                ordered.
                By which it doth appear most fully,
                that antiently
                the Church of <hi>Spain</hi> had
                its
                proper Liturgy, a prescribed
                Form of ministration; and that not only
                fitted
                for the use of the Cathedrals,
                or Mother-Churches;
                but such to which the Parish Churches
                were
                to yield conformity. And for the
                <hi>Gallick</hi>
                Church, though they have now no other Liturgy than that
                which they received
                from <hi>Rome,</hi> power and practice of the
                Emperours
                of the <hi>Caroline</hi> race being
                most operative at home in their own
                dominions;
                yet antiently
                she had
                a Liturgy of her own, (for which see <hi>Beda</hi>'s
                History of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> l. 1. c. 27.)
                as had
                other Churches.
                Concerning
                which it was
                thus ordered
                at the Council of <hi>Vannes,</hi> a City of <hi>Gallia
                Lugdunensis,</hi>
              
              <hi>ut intra Provinciam nostram sacrorum,  ordo</hi>
                (or rather <hi>ordinis</hi>) <hi>Psallendi una sit
                consuetudo,</hi> That in that Province there should be one
                Uniform course in all sacred Offices,
                and in the order of singing,
                from thenceforth observed.
                This was
                in <hi>An.</hi>
                453. or thereabouts.
                Not that there had
                not been
                before those times
                a setled
                and established
                Liturgy in the Church of <hi>France,</hi> but that too
                many had
                presumed
                (as is
                since done
                in other places)
                to neglect their rules,
                and venture on new Forms
                of their own devising.
                Finally,
                for the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (for of
                the <hi>British</hi> Rites
                or Forms
                there is
                nothing certain) it seems
                to be coeval with the Church it self, whether we look upon
                the same as Reformed
                or Planted;
                not borrowed
                or derived
                from <hi>Rome,</hi> as both the <hi>Papist</hi> and the
                <hi>Non-conformist</hi> bear the world in hand, but
                fitted
                to the best edification of this people, <hi>ex singulis
                quibusque Ecclesiis,</hi>
              
              our of the Rituals
                and received
                Forms
                of the most flourishing
                Churches
                at that time in being,
                when first the Gospel was
                made
                known
                to the <hi>English</hi> Nation. The passage
                is
                at large in <hi>Beda,</hi> and thither I refer the Reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nor was
                it otherwise than thus in the <hi>African</hi>
                Churches,
              
              in case we should not reckon them,
                as they are most commonly
                among the Churches
                of the <hi>West.</hi> For, besides
                what was
                noted
                from S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the former Chapter, we find
                some fragments
                of the antient
                Liturgies
                in S. <hi>Augustine</hi> also. Take this, although not
                all, as a taste for all. <hi>Quod ergo in sacramentis
                fidelium dicitur, ut Sursum corda habeamus ad
                Dominum,</hi>
              
              <hi>munus est Domini; de quo munere ipsi Domino Deo nostro
                gratias agere,  Sacerdote post hanc vocem (illi)
                quibus hoc dicitur admonentur,  dignum  justum
                esse respondent.</hi> Wherefore
                (saith
                he) that in the Sacraments
                of the Faithful, it is
                said,
                <hi>That we lift up our hearts
                unto the Lord,</hi> is
                the Lords
                own gift; for which, all they who have
                affirmed
                so of themselves,
                are after admonished
                by the Priest to give thanks
                to God, which they acknowledge
                in their answer to be meet and right. See to the same
                effect, <hi>Epist.</hi> 156. and in other
                places.
                Which with the rest before observed
                out of other Fathers,
                make it clear as day, with what
                an
                high injustice they proceed against this
                blessed
                Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have
                accused
                her for <hi>prescribing
                Responsories
                to be said
                by the people, the Minister being</hi>
              
              
              
              (as they say) <hi>ordained
                by Scripture to be the peoples
                mouth to God.</hi> Which <hi>Responsories,</hi>
                I am
                sure,
              
              I dare boldly
                say it, are freer
                of Impertinencies
                and Tautologies
                (though they charge this on them)
                than any of the best of their extemporary
                prayers,
                be they whose they will. And with as little justice do
                they use S. <hi>Austin,</hi> whose
                words
                they <hi>bring to prove that it
                was
                free for Christians
                to pray as their occasions
                did
                require,</hi>
              
              <hi>without being
                limited
                to prescribed
                prayers.</hi>
                This they are brought
                to prove indeed, they say well in that. For they are thus
                brought
                in, in another place, <hi>viz. And to the same purpose
                (that there were
                then no such stinted
                Liturgies)
                S.</hi> Austin <hi>in his</hi> 121. <hi>Ep. Liberum
                est,</hi> c. <hi>It is
                free to ask the same things
                which are in the Lords
                prayer,</hi>
              
              <hi>aliis atque aliis verbis, sometimes
                one way, and sometimes
                another.</hi> But doth this prove, think they, that in
                those times
                there were
                no stinted
                Liturgies,
                which is
                the matter to be proved?
                I cannot possibly
                believe they think so, whatsoever they say. The Father in
                that place, as they know full well,
                speaks
                of private prayer, and sheweth,
                that in addressing
                our desires
                to God, we are not bound
                to use the very syllables
                and words
                of the Lords
                prayer only. I trow, none ever said
                we were.
                Certain I am,
                that there is
                no such doctrine preached
                by any of the Sons
                of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                Besides,
                if <hi>there were
                publick
                Liturgies
                in S.</hi> Austins <hi>times,</hi>
                as they seem to grant, because they say, they <hi>will not
                peremptorily
                say there were
                not;</hi>
              
              and we say they are peremptory enough, when there
                is
                ground for it: Then certainly,
                whatever might be done
                in private, it was
                not free nor lawful to ask the same thing in the
                publick
                service of the Church, <hi>aliis atque aliis verbis,</hi>
                in other words
                than were
                prescribed
                in those Liturgies.
                And so the testimony out of <hi>Austin</hi>
                is
                neither so full unto the purpose, as they
                did
                intend, nor hath
                it proved
                the matter it was
                brought
                to prove.
              
              So far was
                that good Father from decrying
                either the
                benefit or use of publick
                Liturgies,
                that, as we saw
                before, he derives
                their petigree
                not only from the Apostles
                times,
                (<hi>ab ipsts Apostolorum temporibus</hi> as his own
                words
                are) but also from their words
                and warrant; and therefore was
                not like to countenance so bold a freedom of
                praying
                in Gods
                publick
                worship with what words
                we listed,
                or indeed any other than the prescribed
                Forms.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this being
                only his opinion as a private man,
              
              it may be some will take it to be more
                authentick,
                if he delivered
                it in Synod, and had
                therein the suffrage and consent of all the
                Fathers
                there Assembled:
                And possible it is
                that it may be so. For in the body of the
                Canons,
                which as they stand in <hi>Balsamons</hi>
                collections
                are called
                the Canons
                of the Council of <hi>carthage,</hi> and so they are in
                that of <hi>Zonaras;</hi> but as
                collected
                by <hi>Justellus</hi> are called
                in general, the Canons
                of the Church of <hi>Africa;</hi> there
                is
                one runs
                thus entituled.
                <hi>De precibus quae debent fieri ad
                Altare.</hi>
                Touching
                the prayers
                to be made
                at the Altar.
              
              <hi>Hoc quoque placuit ut precationes quae in Synodo
                confirmatae sunt, sive Praefationes, sive Commendationes,
                sive manus impositiones, ab omnibus peragantur, 
                omnino aliae adversus fidem nunquam proferantur: sed quae
                 sapientioribus colleciae sunt
                dicentur.</hi>
                i. e.
              <q>It seemeth
                good unto us (say the Fathers)
                that those prayers
                which have been
                approved
                of in the Synod, whether that they be
                Prefaces
                or Commendations,
                or laying
                on of hands
                (that is,
                in Ordination, as I conceive, and I will tell you why
                anon) be performed
                by all; that none which be against the faith be
                said
                in publick,
                but only such as have been
                formerly
                composed
                by wise and understanding
                men.</q>
              This Canon, if it were
                made
                in any time, between the year 395. and 430. it
                is
                most likely that S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                had
                a hand in the making
                of it, for so long he sate Bishop of the Church of
                <hi>Hippo.</hi>
              
              For if it were
                decreed
                in the third of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which
                seems
                to have a touch of something of it, <hi>Can.</hi> 23. it
                must be then <hi>An.</hi>
                397. as it is
                ranked
                by <hi>Baronius:</hi> if in the Council of
                <hi>Milevis,</hi> whither some refer it, it
                falls
                into the year 416. by the same account; at one of which S.
                <hi>Austin</hi> was,
                and at both of them
                might be present, for ought I know unto the contrary. But
                the truth is,
                the Canons
                of these <hi>African</hi> Councils
                are much disordered
                in all collections
                of them
                which I yet have seen:
                This Canon in the collection made
                by <hi>zonaras,</hi> being
                the 117th. in that of <hi>Balsamon,
                Can.</hi> 106. in the <hi>Code</hi>
                published
                by <hi>Justellus,</hi> his 103. and amongst those
                ascribed
                to the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council, 'tis in rank the 12th.
                But howsoever it be placed
                in this rank or that, it seems
                it was
                not made
                without good occasion. For as it
                is
                observed
                by <hi>Balsamon,</hi>
              
              . Some Bishops
                then, as since some Presbyters
                have done,
                endeavoured
                to introduce new Forms
                of their own devising.
                And yet it was
                not only the Bishops
                fault; some of the Priests
                was
                no less active in the Innovation,
              
              and unto them
                it is
                referred
                by <hi>Zonaras.</hi> , as he
                tells
                us there. And this not only in the ministration of the
                daily prayers,
                but ,
              
              
              in the very act of <hi>Ordination,</hi> in which the
                Bishop <hi>laying
                hands,</hi>
                , upon the head of
                him
                that was
                to be <hi>ordained,</hi>
                used
                certain prayers.
                Fically, he
                resolves
                that in all the several Acts
                of publick
                Worship, before remembred,
                the <hi>prayers
                confirmed</hi>
                () not first
                devised
                in that Synod should be only used,
                ,
              
              and that no new ones
                brought
                into the Church by any one, whosoever he
                was,
                should be entertained.
                The reason of the which as 'tis
                touched
                before, so is
                it more expresly
                manifested
                in that of the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council, if it
                were
                of that, <hi>Ne forte aliquid contra sidem,</hi>
              
              <hi>vel per ignorantiam vel per minus studium sit
                compositum,</hi> lest else perhaps, either through
                ignorance
                or want of care, something against the rule of Faith be
                composed
                and published.
                So then, this was
                no new restraint, and much less the first, whereby the
                liberty of
                Prayer, or praying
                by a Form of ones
                own devising,
                was
                prescribed
                and limited,
                as some give it out:
              
              but a Reviver only or a Confirmation of the
                antient
                Canons,
                by which it had
                been
                limited
                and prescribed
                before. As for the Canon of the third of
                <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which it seems
                to be permitted
                to the Minister, to use such Prayers
                in the officiating
                Gods
                divine Service, concerning
                which, <hi>cum fratribus instructioribus
                contulerit,</hi> he had
                before conferred
                with the learned
                Brethren:
              
              when they can prove that Canon to be
                made
                in the third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> I shall bethink
                my self of an
                Answer to it. But sure I am,
                that in the third Council of <hi>Carthage,
                Caesario
                 Attico Coss.</hi> as it is
                said
                to be in all Collections
                of the Councils,
                were
                made
                but 24 Canons
                as it is
                in <hi>balsamon,</hi> but five and twenty as in
                <hi>zonaras,</hi> whereof this is
                none. And no less sure, that it
                is
                told
                me by <hi>Baronius, haud omnes in hac Synodo sanciri,</hi>
                that all the Canons
                attributed
                to this Council, were
                not made
                therein:
              
              nor is
                it to be found in the Collection of the
                Canons
                of the Councils
                of <hi>Carthage</hi> either of <hi>Zonaras</hi> or
                <hi>Balsamon,</hi> or in the <hi>Codex Canonum</hi>
                published
                by <hi>Justellus;</hi> and therefore in all probability
                made
                in none at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next look we on the other parts
                of the publick
                Liturgies,
              
              (for other parts
                there were
                besides
                the ministration of the Sacraments,
                and the daily Service) and we shall find as undeniable
                Authorities
                for defence of those, as any of the former, before
                remembred.
                Of these, I shall insist upon no more at this present
                time, than the Form of ordering
                Bishops,
                Priests,
                and Deacons,
                and that of solemnizing
                Matrimony,
                to which we shall adjoyn
                their Form and Rites
                of Burial, and so descend at last to a conclusion. And
                first for that of <hi>Ordination,</hi> whereas the ancient
                Form thereof
                had
                been
                interrupted,
                and many of the Rulers
                of the Church had
                been
                too sensibly
                indulgent to their own affections
                in the dispensing
                of the same: it pleased
                the Fathers
                in the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> not so much to
                ordain and constitute new Forms,
                and Ordinances,
                as revive the old. A Council of that note and
                eminance,
                that as the Acts
                thereof were
                approved
                and ratified
                by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the great (if that add any thing unto
                them);
              
              so by the same the following
                Ages
                of the Church did
                use to regulate and dispose the
                publick
                Discipline. <hi>Adeo ut hoc Concilium Ecclesiae
                disciplinae ad pristinam consuetudinem revocatae, quasi
                promptuarium, semper meritoque
                apud posteros habitum fuit,</hi> as
                saith
                <hi>Binius</hi> truly.
                Now amongst those, they which first lead the way unto all
                the rest, declare the Form and manner to be
                used
                in all <hi>Ordinations,</hi>
                whether of Bishops,
                Priests,
                and Deacons;
                or of inferiour
                Officers
                in the Church of Christ. And first for
                <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                especial care being
                taken
                for an
                inquisition
                into their Doctrine, Life, and Conversation:
              
              it is
                decreed,
                that when a Bishop is
                to be ordained,
                two other Bishops
                are to hold the Book of the holy Gospel over his head; and
                whilest
                one of them
                doth pronounce the <hi>blessing,</hi>
                the rest there present lay their
                hands
                upon his head. <hi>Episcopus cum ordinatur,</hi>
              
              <hi>duo Episcopi
                panant  teneant Evangeliorum codicem super caput
                 cervicem</hi> (or rather <hi>verticem</hi>)
                <hi>ejus;  uno super eum fundente benedictionem,
                reliqui omnes Episcopi qui adsunt, manibus suis caput ejus
                tangant.</hi> So the <hi>canon</hi>
                goeth.
                And this is
                still observed
                in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> save that the
                laying
                of the Book on the parties
                head, is
                turned
                (and as I think with more significancy) into the
                putting
                of the same into
                his hand. Then for the ordering
                of the <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> it
                is
                thus declared.
                <hi>Presbyter cum ordinatur, Episcopo eum benedicente,
                 manum super caput ejus tenente,</hi>
              
              <hi>etiam omnes Presbyteri qui praesentes sunt manus suas
                juxta manum Episcopi super caput illius teneant.</hi> When
                a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is
                to be ordained,
                the <hi>Bishop</hi> giving
                the benediction,
                (or saying
                the words
                of <hi>Consecration</hi>) and holding
                his hand upon his head, all other
                <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                then present are to lay their hands
                upon his head, near the hand of the <hi>Bishop.</hi> And
                this is
                also used
                and required
                in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> save
              
              
              
              that more near unto the Rule and prescript of Antiquity,
                three <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                at least are to be assistant in
                laying
                hands
                upon the party to be ordained.
                And last of all for that of <hi>Deacons</hi>
                it was
                thus provided,
                <hi>solus Episcopus qui eum benedicit, manum super caput
                illius ponat,</hi>
              
              that the <hi>Bishop</hi> only who
                ordains,
                should lay his hand upon
                his head. The reason of the which
                is
                this, <hi>quia non ad Sacerdotium, sed ad
                ministerium
                consecratur,</hi> because he is
                not consecrated
                to the Office of Priesthood, but to
                an
                inferiour
                ministry in the house of God. Nor
                is
                the <hi>Deacon</hi> otherwise ordained
                than thus, in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Here are the
                Rites,
                the visible and external signs:
                but where I pray you are the Forms,
                the prescribed
                words
                and prayers
                which are now in use? I answer, that they are
                included
                in those two phrases,
                <hi>benedicere,</hi> and <hi>fundere benedictionem,</hi>
                to bless, to give the benediction, or pronounce the
                blessing.
                For as a Writer of our own very well
                observes,
                <hi>Benedicere hic nibil aliud est quam verba
                proferre,</hi>
              
              <hi>per quae horum Ordinum potestas traditur:</hi> To
                bless, saith
                he, or give the <hi>benediction,</hi>
                is
                nothing more nor less, than to say those
                words
                by which the power of Order is
                conferred
                on every or either of the parties
                which receive the same. And that the Form of
                words
                then used,
                was
                prescribed
                and set, not left unto the liberty of every Prelate, to
                use what Form of words
                he pleased,
                so he kept
                the sense, we saw
                before in that of <hi>Zonaras:</hi> where he
                affirmed,
                that the Canon formerly
                remembred
                about the using
                prescribed
                Forms
                in the Church of God, did
                reach to <hi>Ordination</hi> also: .
                In <hi>Ordinations,</hi>
              
              saith
                the <hi>Scholiast,</hi>
                the Bishop or Chief Priest laying
                his hands
                on him
                that came
                to be ordained,
                was
                to recite the usual and accustomed
                Prayers.
                <hi>Statas preces exequi solitus est,</hi> as the
                Translator of the <hi>Scholiast.</hi> And this may be
                observed
                withal, that though this Council be of good antiquity, as
                being
                held
                <hi>An.</hi>
                398. yet almost all the Acts
                thereof, and
                those especially
                amongst the rest, were
                rather declaratory of the antient
                Customs
                of the Church of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
              
              than introductory of new: as both <hi>Baronius</hi> and
                <hi>Binius</hi> do affirm and justifie.

            <p>
              That which remains,
              
              concerns
                the Form of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and
                Rites
                of <hi>Burial;</hi> to which a little shall be
                added
                of those pious Gestures
                used
                by them
                in the Act of publick
                Worship: and that being
                done,
                I shall conclude. And first for <hi>Marriage,</hi> there
                is
                no question to be made,
                but that from the beginning
                of Christianity it hath
                been
                celebrated
                by the Priest or Minister, with
                publick
                Prayers
                and Benedictions,
                and most times
                with the celebration of the blessed
                <hi>Eucharist;</hi> whereof thus <hi>Tertullian.
                Unde
                sufficiam ad felicitatem ejus matrimonii enarrandam,</hi>
              
              <hi>quod Ecclesia conciliat,  confirmat oblatio,
                 obsignatum Angeli enunciant, Pater ratum habet?</hi>
                How can I be sufficient,
                saith
                this antient
                Writer, to declare the happiness of that Marriage, which
                the Church celebrates,
                the Sacrament confirmeth,
                which being
                solemnized
                is
                proclaimed
                by the Angels,
                and ratified
                by our heavenly father? To add S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to
                <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                a latter to a former Author, may be thought impertinent,
                yet being
                a Father of the Church, and one against
                whom
                no exception lieth,
                take him
                with you also; and you shall find in
                him,
              
              <hi>Conjugium sacerdotali benedictione
                sanctificari oportere,</hi> that Marriage
                was
                to be sanctified
                with the Priests
                blessing.
                The Ring in Marriage is
                as antient
                as <hi>Tertullian</hi> also, who
                mentioneth
                it in his <hi>Apologetick,
                cap.</hi> 6. and it is
                given
                saith
                <hi>Isidore</hi> by the Bridegroom to his Spouse or Wife,
                <hi>Vel propter mutuae fidei signum,</hi>
              
              <hi>vel ut eodem pignore eorum corda jungantur;</hi>
                either to testifie
                their mutual faith, or rather for a
                pledg
                of that Conjunction, which is
                agreed
                upon between them,
                both in heart and mind. The reason it
                is
                put on the fourth Finger was
                observed
                before; which lest it should be thought to be
                meerly
                <hi>gentile,</hi> you shall also have it from a Christian
                Author,
              
              <hi>Quod in eo vena quaedam sanguinis ad cor usque
                perveniat;</hi> because there goeth
                a vein from thence to the very heart. That the
                Brides
                antiently
                went
                to Church in white Apparel, appeareth
                in the same Author also; though it
                was
                mixt
                with Purple then, which is
                now disused:
                and that they were
                conducted
                to the Church by <hi>Paranymphs</hi>
                or Bridemen,
                as we call them
                now, is
                no less evident, but from an
                antienter Record. Where it is
                said,
                <hi>Sponsus  Sponsa cum benedicendi sunt 
                Sacerdote,
                 parentibus suis vel Paranymphis offerantur:</hi>
              
              That both the Bridegroom and the Bride, must be
                conducted
                to the Church to receive the benediction of the Priest,
                either by their Parents
                or their Bridefolks. Finally,
                to the making
                of a Marriage in those early days,
              
              they had
                their <hi>Tabulas dotales,</hi> their
                Writings
                and Instruments
                of Dowry; by which the married
                couple became
                possessed
                of each others goods;
                from whence it comes
                that in the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
                Man doth
              
              
              actually
                endow his Wife with all his worldly
                goods,
                and that <hi>in facie Ecclesiae</hi> even in the sight and
                hearing
                of the Congregation. Next for their Form or
                Rites
                of <hi>Burial,</hi> not to speak any thing of those
                preparatory actions
                which were
                done
                within doors,
                in the embalming
                of the Body, and making
                it ready for the Sepulture: the
                Corps
                was
                brought
                unto the Grave with Psalms,
                and spiritual Hymns;
                and being
                had
                into the Church, the Priests
                and people said
                the accustomed
                Prayers,
                such as were
                destinate to that business. This we shall
                clearly
                see by those Funeral Rites
                with which the body of <hi>Macrina,</hi> the Sister of
                <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> was
                brought
                unto her burial, as himself describes
                it.
              
              <hi>The Bier, saith
                he, being
                carried
                by Men
                of eminency in the Clergy, was
                on both sides
                attended
                by no small number of Deacons
                and other Ecclesiastical
                Officers,</hi>
                , <hi>each with a Taper in his hand.
                And this was
                not without some mysters;</hi> ,
                <hi>the Psalmody continued
                most melodiously
                from the beginning
                to the end, in consort, not unlike the so much
                celebrated
                Song of the three Children:
                The space betwixt the house from whence we
                came,
                and the burial-place, being
                seven or eight furlongs;
                so that by reason of the throng which
                hindred
                us from hasting
                forward, we spent
                all the day.</hi> , c.
                <hi>Being
                come within the Church, we set down the Bier, and first
                betook
                our selves
                to Prayer</hi> () <hi>which
                moved
                much sorrow in the people; then unto
                Psalms
                again, which were
                much interrupted
                by the cryes
                and lamentations
                of the Virgins,
                which were
                then in place. But we requiring
                them
                by signs,
                to keep silence,</hi> , <hi>and the
                Deacon preparing
                unto Prayer, and crying
                to the people in the accustomed
                words,
                they put themselves into a posture of Prayer, though with
                much ado. Prayers
                being
                done,
                the Body was
                committed
                to the Grave; and all the company
                departed
                to their several houses.</hi>
                A short collation being
                prepared
                at an
                house near hand for the principal
                Mourners:
                to which were
                sometimes
                added
                the poor and needy, the Widow and the fatherless Child,
                <hi>pupillos  viduas saturantes,</hi> as it
                is
                in <hi>Origen.</hi>
              
              More of these Rites
                who list to see, let him
                consult for the first part hereof, the <hi>Psalmody,

                used
                in those Solemnities,

                Finally
                for the <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> although
                condemned
                of late, in some of the Reformed
                Churches,
                there is
                no Man so much a stranger to antiquity, none who
                hath
                ever looked
                into the works
                of the fathers,
                <hi>Basil</hi> or <hi>Ambrose, Nazianzen</hi> or
                <hi>Nyssen,</hi> and indeed whose not; who
                finds
                them
                not to be exceeding
                frequent in those pious times.
                For by that means
                the Dead were
                honoured
                in the commemoration of their faith and piety; and those
                who were
                alive received
                both comfort and instruction, in
                being
                perswaded
                to the imitation of their very Examples.
                <hi>Sic  defunctis praemium,
                 futuris dabatur exemplum,</hi> as <hi>Minutius</hi>
                hath
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next for the <hi>Rites</hi>
                and <hi>Gestures</hi>
                which were
                in use,
              
              (even in the best and purest
                times
                of the Christian Church) at the performance of all
                Acts
                of publick
                Worship; I find some proper to the Priest, some common
                both to Priest and People. That which
                was
                proper to the Priests,
                to such as did
                attend at the holy Altar, was,
                that they did
                attire themselves in a distinct Habit, at the time of the
                ministration; not only from the rest of the common people,
                but even from that which themselves
                used
                to wear at other times,
                though both grave and decent. The colour <hi>white,</hi>
                and the significancy thereof to denote that Holiness,
                wherewith the Ministers
                of God ought to be apparelled:
                and seems
                to have been
                much of the same condition both for use and
                meaning,
                with the Surplice still retained
                in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This we find
                clearly
                evidenced
                in the Constitutions
                ascribed
                to <hi>Clemens,</hi> as may be seen
                in the sixth Chapter of this book, <hi>num.</hi> V. and
                there the Reader may observe it.
                Besides
                which, being
                as I take it, of unquestioned credit, to the point in
                hand; S. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells
                us in the general, that in the act of Ministration, they
                used
                a different Habit, from what they ware at ordinary
                days
                and times.
                <hi>Religio divina alterum habitum
                habet in ministerio, alterum in usu vitaq, communi;</hi>
              
              which is
                sufficient for the general, that it
                was
                so anciently.
                And what this different Habit was,
                he tells
                us more particularly
                in his reply against <hi>Pelagius</hi> who it
                seems
                disliked
                it: and asks
                him
                what offence it could be to God, that
                Bishops,
                Priests,
                and Deacons,
                or those of any
              
              
              
              other inferiour
                Order,
              
              <hi>in administratione
                sacrificiorum candida veste processerint,</hi>
                did
                in the ministration of the Sacraments
                bestir themselves in a <hi>white Vesture.</hi> Nor
                was
                this <hi>white Vesture</hi> taken
                up in the <hi>West</hi> parts
                only, which some observe to have
                been
                more inclinable to superstition than the <hi>Eastern</hi>
                were:
                it was
                received
                and used
                in the <hi>East</hi> parts
                too, as appears
                by <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> Who shewing
                the Priests
                of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of which Church he
                was,
                unto how high a Calling
                the Lord had
                called
                them,
                and how great power they had
                to repell
                unworthy Men
                from the Lords
                Table; adds,
                that they were
                to reckon that for their Crown and glory; and not that
                they were
                priviledged
                to go about the Church in a <hi>white</hi> garment.
              
              , as he pleads
                it there. So antient
                is
                the use of <hi>white Vestments,</hi>
                during the time of ministration in the Church of Christ:
                and from those elder days
                it came
                down to ours,
                being
                received
                long since in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For in the
                Constitutions
                made
                for the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by Archb.
                <hi>Walter,</hi> it was
                decreed,
                with a <hi>praecipimus ut qui Altari
                ministrat
                suppelliceo induatur,</hi>
              
              that he who ministred
                at the Altar should be attired
                in his Surplice. And in the reformation of this Church,
                both in the times
                of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                of blessed
                memory: when as the Church was
                freed
                from those <hi>massing
                garments</hi>
                which superstition in the declining
                times
                of piety had
                introduced
                into the same: the Surplice was
                thought fit to be still retained
                by reason of its
                antient
                and unspotted
                pedigree from the Primitive times.
                I know it hath
                been
                said
                by some, that the first use hereof
                was
                heathenish, and that it was
                first borrowed
                from the Priests
                of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and I know well the
                Priests
                of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were
                at their publick
                Sacrifices,
                arrayed
                in <hi>white.</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
                so informs
                me,
              
              saying,
                <hi>Vestibus lineis uti Aegyptios sacerdotes:</hi> and so
                doth <hi>Pliny</hi> also in his <hi>Natural History,</hi>
                who tells
                us, <hi>Vestes lineus sacerdotibus Aegyptiis gratissimas
                esse.</hi> And I could add, that so it
                was
                in many of the Pomps
                and Sacrifices
                of the <hi>Romans</hi>
                also, of which, thus <hi>Virgil</hi> in the
                <hi>Aeneids.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
              <l>--- Puraque in Veste Sacerdos</l>
              <l>Setigerae foetum suis, intonsam{que} bidentem</l>
              <l>Attulit ---</l>
            </q>
            <p>
              Upon which words
                it is
                observed
                by <hi>Servius, param vestem dici, qua festis diebus uti
                consueverant sacrificaturi;</hi>
              
              that on the Festivals,
                the Priests
                who were
                to sacrifice were
                cloathed
                in pure and unspotted
                Vestures.
                But this seems
                better, as I take it, to shew
                the general use hereof amongst all
                Nations
                whatsoever, that either worshipped
                the true God, or adored
                the false: than to be used
                as an
                argument to disgrace the Habit. For they which have
                been
                pleased
                to object that such a garment as the
                Surplice,
                had
                antiently
                been
                worn
                by the Priests
                of <hi>Isis,</hi> in their idolatrous and wretched
                sacrifices:
                might have observed
                as well, that before that time it
                had
                been
                imposed
                by the best Kings
                of <hi>Judah</hi> on the Priests
                and Levites,
                when they sung
                praises
                unto God,
              
              as was
                shewn
                before: And if they should object from thence that it
                is
                Jewish at the best, and so not fit to be
                continued
                in a Christian Church: they may
                remember if
                they please, that though it was
                a garment of the Priests
                and Levites,
                yet was
                it none of those that were
                appointed
                or imposed
                for the legal Sacrifices,
                but only was
                for the moral Service of Almighty God. This
                makes
                it evident, that as the <hi>white garment</hi> of the
                Priest or Levite was
                used
                in the moral service of God, before it
                had
                been
                taken
                up by the Priests
                of <hi>Egypt;</hi> so was
                it also used
                in the Primitive Church, before
                it came
                to be abused
                by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              Next for those Rites
                which were
                alike common both to <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>people,</hi>
              
              they did
                consist especially
                in those various Gestures
                which anciently
                were
                used
                amongst them,
                according
                to the several parts
                of Gods
                publick
                Worship. Sometimes
                they sate, and that was
                commonly
                as it seems
                during the reading
                of the Lessons,
                or whilest
                the Minister was
                in his Exhortation, or at the singing
                of the Psalms:
                And this I do collect out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who
                shewing
                that the Writings
                of the Prophets
                and Apostles
                were
                read unto the people in the Congregation; and that
                being
                done,
                the President or Bishop went
                unto the Sermon; then adds,
                , they all rose up together,
              
              and betook
                themselves unto their prayers.
                And in the place of <hi>Basil</hi> before
                remembred,
                the Monks
                are said
                to rise up from their prayers,
                , and to proceed unto the
                Psalms.
                Which, as it shews
                that there were
                several gestures
                in the Act of Worship; so I conceive
              
              
              that sitting
                was
                the gesture which was
                used
                during the Lessons,
                Psalms,
                and Sermon:
                At other times
                they used
                to stand, as at the Creed, the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and
                at the reading
                of the Gospel. Their standing
                at the Creed was
                antiently
                used
                to shew
                their readiness in standing
                for the Faith, and the profession of the same before
                persecuting
                Judges,
                never imposed
                by any Canon or decree of Council, for ought I can find,
                but taken
                up on the Authority of antient
                practice, and afterwards
                much strengthned
                by a decree for standing
                up at the holy Gospels,
                of which the Creed was
                but the summary or Abstract. It
                was
                not long before the same gesture
                had
                been
                taken
                up (for I find not that it was
                imposed
                by publique
                Sanction) at the reading
                also of the Creed, as being
                the sum and substance of the holy
                Gospels.
                <hi>Et cum Symbolum est verbum Evangelicum
                quoad sensum ergo illud stando sicut Evangelium
                dicitur.</hi>
              
              Of standing
                at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> we shall speak more at large
                in the following
                Section. And as for the standing
                at the Gospel, it was
                decreed,
                if not before, by Pope <hi>Anastasius,</hi> by
                whom
                it was
                ordained,
              
              saith
                <hi>Platina, Ne Sacerdotes ullo modo sederent, sed curvi
                 venerabundi starent, cum evangelium caneretur aut
                legeretur in Ecclesia.</hi> But by his leave the
                <hi>Decretal,</hi> from which this must be
                taken,
                goes
                a great deal further, and doth not only reach the
                Priests,
                but <hi>caeteros omnes praesEntes,</hi> all who
                were
                present in the Church.
              
              And doubtless
                'twas in use before, though but now
                enjoyned;
                <hi>Sozomen</hi> blaming
                it in the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi>
                (and he lived
                long before the time of <hi>Anastasius</hi>) that at the
                reading
                of the Gospels,
                , the Bishop
                stood
                not up as in other places.
              
              Yet you must understand it so, that they
                used
                not to stand upright, <hi>sed curvi 
                venerabundi,</hi> saith
                the letter <hi>decretal,</hi> but with the
                bowing
                of the body, as in the way of adoration; and more than so
                too, if the name of Jesus did
                occur in the reading
                of it, they used
                with all reverence and duty to bow the knee; which in
                those parts
                and times
                was
                the greatest
                sign both of humility and subjection. Of this we need no
                other witness than the great S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> whose
                speaking
                in his <hi>Hexaemeron,</hi>
              
              touching
                the particular office of each several member; he
                makes
                the bowing
                of the knee at the name of Jesus the proper duty of that
                part. Kneeling
                they used
                both in the act of Prayer and Invocation, as also in the
                participation or receiving
                of the blessed
                Sacrament. First, in the act of Prayer or Invocation, for
                when <hi>Tertullian</hi> blamed
                it in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                that they did
                <hi>assidere sub aspectu contraque aspectum ejus,</hi>
              
              sit down irreverently
                before their Gods,
                as soon as they had
                done
                their Prayers:
                And when as <hi>Origen</hi> asks
                the reason, <hi>quod genua flectimus orantes,</hi> why we
                should kneel upon our knees
                in the time of Prayer; both of them
                put it out of question, that in the act of Prayer or
                Invocation, the Christians
                of those early times
                were
                upon their knees.
                Next for the reverence which they
                used
                in the time of Participation, the least that can be
                said
                of them
                is,
                that they received
                the Sacrament upon their knees.
                What else can be the meaning
                of that of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> where he
                informeth
                us of the <hi>Christians</hi>
                of his time, that they did
                <hi>carnem Christi in mysteriis adorare,</hi> adore the
                flesh of Christ in the holy mysteries;
              
              or that of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> .
                <hi>When thou seesT
                all things
                ready at the great Kings
                Table, the Angels
                ministring
                at the same, the King in presence, and thou thy self
                provided
                of a Wedding
                garment, cast thy self down upon thy
                knees
                at least, and so Communicate.</hi> And what else think you
                caused
                the Gentiles
                to accuse the Christians
                living
                in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time, for
                worshipping
                <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> two good
                Belly-gods;
              
              but that they were
                observed
                to kneel when they received
                the Bread and Wine in the blessed
                Eucharist? And all this done
                with hands
                stretched
                out, and heads
                uncovered,
                <hi>manibus expansis,</hi>
              
              <hi>capite nudo,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                hath
                it; and as S. <hi>Basil</hi> doth observe of <hi>Gregory
                Nazianzen,</hi> , that he
                used
                not to be covered
                in the time of prayer. Add, that they
                turned
                towards
                the <hi>East</hi> in the act of worship, whereof consult
                with <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> in his Book of
                Questions
                and Answers
                <hi>ad Orthodopes,</hi> Qu. 118. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in
                his <hi>Apologetick,</hi>
                chap. 16. <hi>Origen</hi> in his 5. <hi>Homily</hi> on the
                Book of <hi>Numbers;</hi>
                not to say any thing of those who
                came
                after them:
                And then we have a perfect view of the most usual and
                material orders,
                used
                by the Primitive Christians
                in Gods
                publique
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I do conclude this Age, I shall
                subjoyn
                some few notes
                on the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> retained
                on so good grounds
                in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> so oft
                repeated
                in the divine service of the same; so
                solemnly
                and reverently
                pronounced
                by those who either understand
                their own Christian duties,
                or the intentions
                of the antient
                holy Catholick
                Church. And those remembrances
                I shall reduce unto these three
                heads.
                First, I shall shew
                the Antiquity and Original of it:
                Secondly,
                when, and by what Authority it became
                a part of the publick
                Liturgies:
                And thirdly,
                in what posture Gods
              
              
              
              people used
                to put themselves, as often as there
                was
                occasion to pronounce the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concerning
                the Antiquity of the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi>
              
              I know it is
                referred
                by some to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or the
                times
                immediately
                succeeding;
                and that it is
                by them
                conceived
                to have been
                framed
                of purpose for a Counterpoise to the <hi>Arian</hi>
                Heresie,
                and to train up the people in the right
                perswasion
                of the holy Trinity. And were
                it so, it need not be ashamed
                of its
                Original, or look into the world for a better
                petigree;
                the space of 1300 years
                and more, being
                abundantly
                sufficient to procure it credit, and set it far enough
                above the reach of contentious men.
                But yet S. <hi>Basil</hi> who lived
                near that Council,
              
              goes
                a great deal higher,
                and fetcheth
                the Original of it , from the
                tradition of the Apostles;
                and cites
                some of the antient
                Fathers,
                and amongst them
                S. <hi>Clemens,</hi> the Apostles
                Scholar, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                who died
                long time before this Council, and in whose
                writings
                this <hi>doxology</hi> was
                expresly
                found. For the Apostles
                being
                commanded
                by their Lord and Saviour to teach and
                Baptize
                all people <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
                and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> there
                is
                no question to be made,
                but that in due conformity to their
                Masters
                pleasure they did
                accordingly
                proceed; and for a preparatory thereunto
                required
                of such as were
                to be added
                to the Church, a solemn profession of that Faith, into
                which they were
                to be Baptized.
                And this Confession of the Faith he
                calls
                , the Original and mother as it
                were
                of that <hi>Doxologie,</hi>
                then and of long time used
                in the Church of Christ.
              
              And then it followeth
                in these words,
                . <hi>i. e.</hi> That as they
                had
                received,
                so they did
                Baptize,
                and as they did
                Baptize,
                so they did
                believe,
              
              and as they did
                believe, so they also glorified.
                But they Baptized
                in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
                Ghost; and they believed
                in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost; and
                therefore also had
                some Form of ascribing
                <hi>Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</hi> which
                was
                the Form remaining
                on record in those antient
                Fathers,
                whose names
                there occur. And this he further
                proves
                by an
                antient
                ceremony used
                of old at Candle tinding, which he
                ascribeth
                also , to the tradition of the
                Fathers;
                but by which of them
                devised
                or first introduced,
                that he could not tell. Onely
                he noteth,
                that at the first bringing
                in of the Evening lights,
                the people were
                accustomed
                to say these words,
                . <hi>We glorifie
                or praise the Father and the Son,</hi>
              
              <hi>and the Holy Spirit of God;</hi> (just as we
                used
                to say in these <hi>Western</hi>
                parts
                upon the very same occasion, <hi>God send us the light of
                Heaven.</hi>) Which as the Father
                calleth,
                , an
                antient
                Ceremony, an
                old Form of words;
                so doth he tell us therewithal, , that
                the observation of the same was
                not imputed
                unto any (as the other is)
                either for superstition or impiety.
              
              The <hi>Scholiast</hi> or <hi>Nicephorus</hi> (whosoever
                he was)
                doth observe this custom, and gives
                us the whole Form at large of this .
                whither I refer you; this being
                only by the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              'Tis true, the following
                words,
                <hi>Sicut erat in principio,</hi> c. which make up
                the whole frame of this <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                (as it is
                now used
                in the Church) came
                not in till afterwards,
                upon occasion of the spreading
                of the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie,
                by which it was
                most impiously
                maintained
                and taught,
                <hi>erat quando non erat,</hi> that there
                was
                once a time when the Son was
                not, and so not coeternal with his heavenly Father. And
                though I cannot
                say with the Learned
                Cardinal, that this addition was
                put to it in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
              
              because I find it not in the Acts
                of that Council, or otherwise than by
                him
                ascribed
                unto it; yet certainly
                it was
                adjoyned
                unto it much about that time, and questionless on that
                occasion. And so much is
                affirmed
                in the Council of <hi>Vaisons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
              
              <hi>Concilium Vasense  Vassionense</hi> the
                <hi>Latines</hi>
                call it: Where it is
                said,
                <hi>Propter haereticorum asTutiam qua Dei filium non emper
                cum Patre fuisse, sed  tempore coepisse
                blasphemant,
                in omnibus clausulis post Gloria Patri,  filio 
                filio  spiritui sancto, dicitur, sicut erat in
                principio,  nunc est,  in secula seculorum.</hi>
                Which points
                both to a former usage in some other
                Churches
                where this addition was
                received
                (whereof more anon) and to the crafty malice of the
                <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks,
                for a most soveraign
                Antidote to whose poysons
                it was
                first devised.
                A further proof of which I shall
                shew
                you presently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such being
                the Antiquity and use of this <hi>Doxologie,</hi>
              
              we will next see when, and by what Authority it first
                became
                a part of the publick
                Liturgies.
                I know <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ascribes
                it unto <hi>Flavianus Patriarch of Antioch,
                An.</hi>
                380. or thereabouts;
                who as he saith,
                , by the advise and help of
                <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (being
              
              
              then a Minister in that Church)
                did
                first ordain it.
              
              But certainly
                it was
                of longer
                standing
                in the Church than so. For it is
                said
                by <hi>Sozomen,</hi> that when <hi>Leontius</hi> the
                <hi>Arian</hi> was
                Bishop of that See, which was
                in the year 350. some five and twenty
                years,
                no more, after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the people
                being
                divided
                in opinions
                about the Deity of our Saviour,
                did
                so use the matter, that when they
                met
                to glorifie
                the name of God in the Congregation,
              
              and sung
                the holy Anthems
                Quire-wise ( in the
                Authors
                words)
                as the custom was,
                , they manifested
                their dissent from one another in the conclusion of those
                Hymns
                or Anthems;
                the Orthodox Professors
                using
                the whole Form as it was
                prescribed
                by the Church, and saying,
                <hi>Glory be to the Father and to the Son,</hi>
              
              <hi>and to the Holy Ghost, As it
                was
                in the beginning,</hi>
                c. The Hereticks
                pronouncing
                it with this alteration, <hi>Glory be to the Father, by
                the Son, in the Holy Ghost,</hi> c. to make it
                serviceable
                to their sense. And for <hi>Leontius</hi> himself who
                was
                most observed,
                he did
                so mutter the whole <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                between his teeth,
                , and passed
                it over with such silence as the Author
                hath
                it, that the most diligent stander by could hear no more
                from him
                but , <hi>world without end,</hi>
                Amen.
              
              This makes
                it evident, that as this Form of
                giving
                glory to each person of the blessed
                Trinity,
                was
                the , the badge or cognizance by which
                the Orthodox Professors
                were
                distinguished
                from the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks;
                and therefore called
                most properly
                by renowned
                S. <hi>Basil,</hi> ,
              
              the evidence or demonstration
                of a sound belief; so presently
                upon the first compleating
                of it, it came
                by general
                consent to have a proper place in the
                publick
                Liturgies,
                and was
                accustomably
                repeated
                in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches
                at the conclusion of such Hymns
                or Anthems,
                as were
                composed
                and sung
                to the honour of God. Which also
                is
                affirmed
                in these words
                of <hi>Cassian,</hi> an
                antient
                Writer,
              
              <hi>viz. Hac glorificatione
                Trinitatis per omnem Orientem solere Antiphonam
                terminari,</hi> that throughout the <hi>East,</hi> the
                Anthems
                were
                concluded
                with that <hi>Doxologie,</hi>
                that Form of giving
                glory to the blessed
                Trinity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now as the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches
                used
                to add this <hi>formula</hi> to the conclusion of such
                Hymns
                or Anthems,
                as they composed
                for Gods
                service in the Congregation; so
                was
                it added
                in the Churches
                of these <hi>Western</hi> parts,
                at the close of each of <hi>Davids</hi>
                Psalms,
                which made
                up a great part of the publick
                Liturgies,
                by the perswasion
                of S. <hi>Hierom.</hi> Who living
                in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts
                for a certain time, and noting
                with what fruit and benefit
                the <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                was
                added
                there at the end of the Hymns,
                addressed
                his Letters
                to Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> (who entred
                on the See of <hi>Rome, An.</hi>
                367.) advising
                or desiring,
                call it which you will, <hi>ut in fine cujuslibet
                Psalmi,</hi> that at the end of every Psalm, he would
                cause this <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                to be added,
                <hi>viz. Gloria Patri,</hi> c. <hi>Sicut erat in
                principio,</hi> c.
              
              To the intent that the profession of the faith set forth
                by the 318. Bishops
                in the Council of <hi>Nice, in vestro ore pari consortio
                declaretur,</hi> should be avowed
                and published
                with a like consent in all the Churches
                of his <hi>Patriarchate.</hi> I know indeed some
                Learned
                men
                are of opinion that this Epistle
                is
                not <hi>Hieroms;</hi>
                and perhaps it is
                not. But whether it be his or not (which I will not stand
                on) most sure it is
                that <hi>Damasus</hi> did
                the thing which that Letter speaks
                of in the Churches
                of his jurisdiction. Of which thus <hi>Platina</hi> in his
                life: <hi>Instituit quoque ut Psalmi alternis vicibus in
                ecclesia canerentur,</hi>
              
              <hi>utque in fine corum haee verba ponerentur, Gloria
                Patri  filio,</hi> c. <hi>Damasus</hi>
                (saith
                he) ordained
                that the Psalms
                should be sung
                Quire-wise (or by each side of the Quire in
                turns)
                and that at the end of every Psalm they should add these
                words,
                <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,</hi> c.
                Which being
                thus ordained
                in the Churches
                of the <hi>Roman Patriarchate,</hi>
                became
                forthwith admitted
                also into other Churches
                of the <hi>West,</hi> as appears
                plainly
                by that Canon of the Council of <hi>Vaisons,</hi> which
                you had
                before; which I choose rather to refer with the Collector
                of the Councils
                to the time of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the 2d. who
                lived
                after
                <hi>Damasus,</hi> than with <hi>Baronius</hi> to the year
                337. when no such Form to which that Canon doth relate,
                had
                gotten
                any footing
                in the <hi>Western</hi> Liturgies.
                Now the said
                Canon taking
                notice of a former usage of some other
                Churches,
                where this <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                was
                added
                at the end of the Psalms,
                ordains
                the like to be observed
                in the Churches
                of <hi>France, quod  nos in universis Ecclesiis
                nostris dicendum esse decrevimus,</hi>
              
              as their words
                there are. And to this purpose,
                besides
                that of <hi>Cassian</hi> (which we shall
                presently
                produce for another point) we may add these
                words
                of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> (he began
                his Popedom, <hi>An.</hi>
                535.) who in his Epistle unto <hi>Eleutherius</hi>
                gives
                us this short note, <hi>In fine Psalmorum ab omnibus
                Catholicis ex more dici, Gloria Patri,  filio,</hi>
                c. That is
                to say,
              
              that <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> was
                subjoyned
                at the end of the Psalms,
                according
                to the antient
                custom, by all Catholick
                persons.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
              As for the gesture which was
                used
                both by Priest and People at the
                repeating
                of this <hi>Doxologie,</hi>
              
              it was
                the same with that which is
                still retained.
                They said
                it standing
                on their feet.
                And this appears
                expresly
                by the words
                of <hi>Cassian,</hi> who telleth
                us, that in the Province of <hi>Gaul Narbonnoyse,</hi>
                where he then lived,
                it was
                the custom of the Church,
              
              <hi>in clausula psalmi omnes astantes concinere cum
                clamore, Gloria Patri,</hi> c. That at the close of
                every Psalm, the whole Congregation
                standing
                up, did
                sing together with a loud voice, <hi>Glory be to the
                Father,</hi> c. Contrary to the custom of the
                <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches.
                In which it is
                to be observed,
                that the singularity noted
                by that Author to have been
                used
                in those Countreys
                at the pronouncing
                of the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> was
                not, in that the Congregation stood
                upon their feet
                at the repeating
                of the same, which was
                most like to be the custom of the <hi>East</hi>
                Churches
                also; but that it was
                subjoyned
                in <hi>Gaul Narbonnoyse,</hi>
                (as in all Churches
                of the <hi>West</hi>) at the end of the
                Psalms,
                whereas it was
                used
                only in the <hi>East</hi> at the end of the
                <hi>Anthems,</hi>
                as before was
                shewn
                you from this Author. Now <hi>Cassian</hi>
                was
                S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Scholar, if not his Convert, and
                lived
                about the year 430. before the Church
                was
                overgrown
                with needless Ceremonies,
                or that the native piety of the true Religion
                was
                overshadowed
                by the superstitions
                of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis true, we find not any
                Canon which enjoyned
                this gesture, but that it was
                first taken
                up by the voluntary usage and consent of Christian people,
                who might conceive that gesture to be
                fittest
                for it, in regard that it contained
                not only a bare Form of giving
                glory to the Lord, but also a profession of the Christian
                Faith in the great mystery of the holy undivided Trinity,
                and therefore fit to be pronounced
                in that very posture, in which from all Antiquity they
                rehearsed
                their Creed. And being
                so taken
                up, as before was
                said,
                it hath
                been
                still retained
                in the general practice of the Church to this very day,
                not by any Canon of the Church, or decree of Pope, or
                other Ecclesiastical Constitution; but <hi>ex vi
                Catholicae consuetudinis,</hi> by force of a
                continual
                Catholick
                custom which in such points
                as these hath
                the power of Law. For though in
                Articles
                of the Faith, which are the <hi>credenda</hi> of the
                Church, we may say with <hi>Hierom,</hi>
              
              <hi>Non credimus quia non legimus,</hi> We are not
                bound
                to submit our belief unto
                them,
                but as they are expressed
                in the Word of God, or else deduced
                from the same by plain and evident illation; yet in the
                outward Forms
                of Worship, which are the <hi>Agenda</hi> of the Church,
                we must say with the good Fathers
                of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, ,
              
              <hi>Let antient
                customs
                be observed
                and prevail amongst us.</hi> And this
                is
                that for which S. <hi>Basil</hi>
                pleadeth
                so heartily
                in the very case of this <hi>Doxologie.</hi>
                Where first he lays
                it for a ground, , c. That if we
                take away all unwritten usages
                from the Church of God, as being
                of no efficacy in his publick
                service, we shall do great detriment to the Gospel,
                . and in conclusion make the
                preaching
                of the Word but a powerless name.
              
              Of which kind, he accounts
                and nameth
                the <hi>signing
                of the true Believers</hi>
                with the sign of the Cross, ,
                <hi>their turning
                towards
                the East</hi> when they said
                their prayers,
                the Form of Consecrating
                the Bread and Wine in the blessed
                Sacrament of the Lords
                Supper, the hallowing
                of the Water for the Sacrament
                of Baptism, the <hi>trina immersio</hi>
                used
                of old, , and the
                renouncing
                of the Devil and his Angels,
                still in use amongst us. And of this kind
                was
                that particular gesture which is
                now in question, not recommended
                to our observation by any particular Law or Canon; but
                only by successional tradition, and the continual practice
                of the Christian Church, which is
                Authority sufficient for a greater
                matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              And in this track the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                went
                at her Reformation, when she ordained
                according
                to the antient
                Canons,
                that at the end of every Psalm throughout the year, and
                likewise at the end of <hi>Benedictus, Benedicite,
                Magnificat,</hi> and <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi>
                shall be repeated,
              
              <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> c. <hi>As it
                was
                in the beginning,</hi>
                c. But for the gesture to be
                used,
                referred
                it to the antient
                practice of the Church of Christ, as
                formerly
                the Church had
                done
                in the self same case. Which practice
                hath
                been
                constantly
                preserved
                since the Reformation, in all the
                Cathedrals
                of this Kingdom, in the Chappels
                Royal, and in some Parish Churches
                also; to which, and to the usage of the primitive
                times
                it is
                more just and reasonable that all particular
                persons
                should conform themselves, than that the
                antient
                and unblamable usages
                of the Church of God should be changed
                and varied
                according
                to the wild affections
                of particular men.
                The Church is
                now as much in danger to be infected
                and destroyed
                by the <hi>Socinian</hi> Blasphemies,
                as ever heretofore by the <hi>Arian</hi>
                Heresies;
                and therefore this <hi>Doxologie</hi>
                as necessary in these present times,
                and to be said
                with as great reverence and solemnity by all good
              
              
              Christian people, as in those before. We cannot better
                make profession of our faith in the holy Trinity, than by
                this Form, and in the constant uniformity of that
                antient
                Gesture, which hath
                been
                recommended
                to us from the purest
                Ages,
                and the most glorious lights
                of the Christian World.

              HAving
                thus found out <hi>Liturgies</hi>
                and <hi>set Forms
                of Worship</hi> in the best and
                purest
                times
                of the Christian Church,
              
              together with certain places
                and appointed
                times
                for the performance of those Offices
                of Religious Worship in the said
                Liturgies
                prescribed:
                It remains
                now that we speak somewhat as by way of Corollary,
                touching
                the Dedication of those places,
                in which those Acts
                and Offices
                of Religious
                Worship were
                to be performed:
                it being
                consonant to Reason, that <hi>holy
                Actions</hi>
                should be celebrated
                in an
                <hi>holy place,</hi> and places
                are not otherwise hallowed,
                than by the Dedication of them
                unto holy Use. For howsoever in themselves they be but
                ordinary Houses,
                made
                of Lime and Stone, and may be put to any use which the
                Founder pleaseth;
                yet being
                once consecrated
                by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> they become
                forthwith <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> and carry with
                them
                such an
                awful reverence in Religious minds,
                as is
                not given
                to other houses,
                houses
                to eat and drink in, as the Scripture
                calleth
                them.
                And so we are to understand that of <hi>Thomas
                Aquinas,</hi> who in the stating
                of this Question, hath
                resolved
                it thus: <hi>Quod Ecclesia 
                Altare,
                 alia hujusmodi
                inanimata consecrantur, non quia sunt gratiae
                susceptiva,</hi>
              
              <hi>sed quia ex consecratione
                adipiscuntur quandam spiritalem virtutem, per quam apta
                redduntur divino cultui: Churches,</hi>
                saith
                he, <hi>Altars,</hi>
                and things
                inanimate are not therefore consecrated,
                because they
                are susceptible of any divine Grace
                conferred
                upon them;
                but because they do obtain thereby some spiritual fitness,
                which before they had
                not, and which doth render them
                more proper for Religious Offices.
                Besides
                which influence which they gain by these
                Consecrations
                on the minds
                of such who piously
                refort unto them,
                they are thereby exempted
                also from the power of those by
                whom
                they were
                first built
                or founded,
                who otherwise might challenge a propriety in
                them.
                That which the ground and charge of building
                made
                the house of Man, is
                made
                by <hi>Consecration</hi>
                the House of God; and being
                once dedicated
                to his holy Service, the property
                thereof is
                vested
                in him,
                and in him
                alone. The Founder cannot take it back, or reserve any
                part of it for his own private use or pleasure, without
                sin and sacriledg.
                Such was
                that of <hi>Ananias,</hi>
              
              who when he sold
                his House kept
                back part of the money; as if he would divide the sum
                betwixt God and himself. The <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                by the light of Nature had
                discerned
                thus much, and therefore in the <hi>Consecration</hi> of
                their Temples
                they did
                use these words,
                <hi>Se ex profano usu  humano jure,
                Templum,
              
              
              
              cellam,</hi>
              
              <hi>mensas, arulas, quae{que} eo pertinent eximere:</hi>
                That is
                to say, That they exempt from the right of
                Men,
                and all profane and common usage, the Temple, Table,
                Vaults
                and Altars,
                and all things
                which pertained
                unto them,
                appropriating
                them
                unto the service of that God, to
                whom
                the Fabrick
                was
                intended
                in the Dedication.
                A matter of such general use, that it
                was
                commonly
                observed
                both by the Patriarchs
                before the Law, by the <hi>Jews</hi>
                under the Law, by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                without the Law, and finally
                by the Christians,
                (being
                a body made
                up both of <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>)
                in the times
                of the Gospel. In looking
                over whose proceedings
                touching
                this particular, and thereby justifying
                the right use of those Dedications,
                we will first search into the Antiquity, Universality, and
                first Authors
                of them,
                next into the great Solemnities
                and magnificent Feasts,
                accustomably
                observed
                in them;
                and finally
                on the Annual Revolution of those solemn
                Feasts,
                appointed
                by all sorts
                of Men
                in memorial of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              And first for laying
                down the Antiquity and first Authors
                of them,
              
              it is
                necessary that we look back on something which
                was
                said
                before, touching
                the practice of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi>
                and some of the godly Princes
                of the House of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And first, whereas the
                Scripture telleth
                us of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he
                planted
                a Grove in</hi> Beersheba, <hi>and
                called
                there on the Name of the Lord,</hi>
              
              <hi>the everlasting God:</hi> The
                meaning
                of which place is
                by Expositors
                left uncertain, as before we noted;
                yet the succeding
                practice both of <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                in consecrating
                Groves
                for superstitious and Idolatrous
                Uses,
                (mention whereof is
                very frequent in the Scriptures)
                makes
                it plain and evident that they concdeived this
                planting
                of a <hi>Grove</hi> by <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                was
                but the consecrating
                of it to the service of God, for
                invocating
                on the Name of the <hi>Lord Jehovah.</hi>
                Greater
                Antiquity than this, as we need not seek; so a more holy
                Author of those Dedications
                we can hardly
                find. And yet the practice and Authority of <hi>Jacob</hi>
                is
                not much short of it, either in point of reputation or
                respect of time; of whom
                it is
                recorded,
                that he <hi>took
                the Stone which he had
                put for his Pillow,</hi>
              
              <hi>and set it up for a Pillar, and
                poured
                Oyl
                on the top of it,</hi> and then, and not till then that it
                was
                thus consecrated,
                he called
                the name of the place <hi>BETHEL,</hi> which by
                interpretation is
                the <hi>House of God.</hi> Look what effect this Act of
                <hi>Jacob</hi> did
                produce, and we shall find first, that God
                took
                unto himself the name of the God of <hi>Bethel,</hi> as a
                place dedicated
                for his Worship, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 13. And
                secondly,
                that in reference to this Consecration, it
                was
                thought the fittest
                place for <hi>Jacob,</hi> even by God himself, to
                <hi>offer sacrifice to the Lord, and to pay his
                vows,</hi>
                Gen. 35.16. Nor can I doubt but that when
                <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi>
                made
                choice of <hi>Bethel,</hi>
              
              to be the seat for one of his <hi>Golden
                Calves,</hi>
                he had
                respect unto the consecration of this place by the
                <hi>Patriarch Jacob;</hi> there
                being
                otherwise many places
                in his new gotten
                Kingdom of more convenience for his
                Subjects,
                and less obnoxious
                to the Power of the Kings
                of <hi>Judah,</hi> than this <hi>Bethel</hi>
                was.
                The Act of <hi>Jacob</hi> in consecrating
                the Stone at <hi>Bethel,</hi> gave
                the same hint to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to profane the place by
                setting
                up his Golden Calves;
                as <hi>Abrahams
                Grove,</hi> gave
                to the Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                for polluting
                the like places
                with as impure abominations.
                And probable enough it is
                that by these Acts
                of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the
                <hi>Macchabees</hi>
                proceeded
                to the Dedication of the <hi>Altar,</hi> when
                profaned
                by <hi>Antiochus;</hi> though they
                made
                use only of their own Authority in
                honouring
                that work and the celebration
                of it with an
                Annual Feast, of which see <hi>Macc.</hi> 1. Chap. 4. v.
                59, <hi>c.</hi> Which Feast
                being
                countenanced
                by our Saviour, as is
                elsewhere said,
                gave
                the first ground unto the Anniversary
                Feasts
                of Dedication used
                in the best and happiest
                times
                of Christianity;
              
              of which thus <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Sivil, Annuas
                Festivitates dedicationis, Ecclesiarum
                ex more veterum celebrari in Evangelio legimus, ubi
                dicitur, facta sunt Encoenia,</hi>
                c. Where we have both the custom and the
                reasons
                of it, that is
                to say, the antient
                practice of Gods
                people amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                occasionally
                mentioned
                and related
                too in the holy Gospel. This being
                repeated
                and applyed,
                we must next see by what Authority
                Gods
                people afterward proceeded
                on the like occasions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Greater
                Authority we find for the Dedication of the Tabernacle,
              
              than for the consecrating
                the <hi>Grove</hi> or <hi>Pillar,</hi> which before we
                spake
                of, even the command of God himself; who though he
                had
                appointed
                it to be made,
                prescribed
                as well the matter as the Form thereof,
                descending
                even unto the nomination of the
                Workmen
                that were
                to take care of the Embroydery
                of it, did
                not think fit it should be used
                in his publick
                Worship, till it had
                first been
                dedicated
                to that end and purpose.
                For thus saith
                God to <hi>Moses</hi>
                in the way of Precept: <hi>And thou
                shalt
                take the anointing
                Oyl
                and anoint the</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>and all that
                is
                therein, and shalt</hi>
                hallow
              
              
              <hi>it, and all the Vessels
                thereof, and it shall be holy, and thou
                shalt</hi>
                anoint <hi>the Altar of the Burnt-offering,
                and all his Vessels,
                and</hi> sanctifie
                <hi>the Altar,</hi>
              
              <hi>and it shall be an
                Altar most holy,</hi> c. And thus
                did
                <hi>Moses</hi>
                in conformity to the Lords
                Commandment, of whom
                it is
                affirmed,
                <hi>Thus did</hi>
                Moses
                <hi>according
                to all that the Lord commanded
                him,
                so did
                he.</hi> That is
                to say, he reared
                up the Tabernacle,
              
              and disposed
                of every thing therein in its
                proper place, <hi>hallowing</hi>
                the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the
                Vessels
                of it as the Lord commanded,
                and then, and not till then, was
                it thought fit for the Acts
                of Sacrifice, and to be honoured
                with the presence of the Lord their God. For as it
                followeth
                in that Chapter, first <hi>Moses</hi>
                offered
                on the <hi>Altar</hi> (so prepared
                and consecrated)
                a Burnt-Offering
                and a Meat-Offering
                as the Lord commanded,
                <hi>ver.</hi>
                29. And secondly,
                <hi>A Cloud then covered
                the tent of the Congregation,
                and the glory of the Lord filled
                the Tabernacle,</hi> v. 34. No Fathers
                need be called
                in here to explain these Scriptures,
                which every one can understand, who
                is
                able to read them,
                and every one who understandeth
                them
                may conclude from hence, that God
                had
                never took
                such order for consecrating
                of the Tabernacle, the Altars
                and other Vessels
                of it, had
                he not meant
                to leave it for a Document and Example to
                succeeding
                times,
                that no place should be used
                for his publick
                Worship,
                till it was
                sanctified
                with Prayer, and set apart by some Religious
                Ceremonies
                for that holy purpose. According
                to which great Example, we find a solemn dedication of the
                Temple, when first built
                by <hi>Solomon,</hi> performed
                by Prayer and Sacrifices
                in most solemn manner, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
                8. A second Dedication of it, when first
                restored
                by <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where
                it is
                said,
                That <hi>the children
                of Israel,</hi>
              
              <hi>the Priests
                and the Levites,
                and the rest of the children
                of the Captivity kept
                the Dedication
                of this House of God with joy.</hi> And
                finally,
                <hi>Josephus</hi> telleth
                us,
              
              that when <hi>Zorobabels</hi>
                Temple was
                pulled
                down by <hi>Herod,</hi> and built
                again after a more magnificent
                manner than before it was,
                with what alacrity and pomp the
                <hi>Jews</hi>
                did
                celebrate
                the Dedication of the same. A Temple
                gloriously
                set out to the outward view (<hi>immensae opulentiae
                Templum,</hi> it is
                called
                by <hi>Tacitus</hi> as before was
                said)
                and dedicated
                by the Founder with as great magnificence, of which more
                hereafter. Sufficient evidence to prove, that whether the
                Temple be considered
                as a <hi>House of prayer,</hi> or a place for
                <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it was
                not to be used
                for either, not sanctified
                and set apart for those holy Actions.
                Having
                thus seen
                what was
                done
                in those solemn Acts
                of Dedication, by the Lords
                own people, as well before as under the Law of
                <hi>Moses;</hi>
                let us next see how far those Actions
                of Gods
                people have been
                followed
                by the antient
                <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                who though without the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                yet were
                instructed
                well enough by the light of Nature, that Sacred
                Actions
                were
                not to be used
                in <hi>unhallowed</hi>
                places.

              And here to go no further than the <hi>Roman</hi> story,
                being
                the best compacted,
              
              and most flourishing
                estate among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
                we have in the first Infancy thereof a Temple
                <hi>dedicated</hi>
                by <hi>Romulus</hi> unto <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> of
                which thus <hi>Livy. Jupiter Feretri (inquit Romulus) haec
                tibi victor Rex Regia arma fero, Templum{que} iis
                Regionibus
                quas meo animo metatus sum, dedico, sedem opimis spoliis
                quae Regibus Ducibus{que} hostium caesis, me Autorem
                sequentes posteri ferent.</hi> Unto which
                words
                of <hi>Romulus,</hi> being
                the formal words
                of the Dedication; <hi>Livy</hi>
                adds
                his own,
              
              <hi>Haec Templi est origo, quod omnium primum Romae
                sacratum est:</hi> That is
                to say, this is
                the Original of that Temple, which first of all
                was
                dedicated
                in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Concerning
                which, we are to know, that <hi>Romulus</hi>
                having
                vanquished
                <hi>Tolumnius</hi> a poor neighbouring
                King, in the head of his Army, and
                brought
                his Armour into <hi>Rome</hi> in
                triumphant
                manner, designed
                a Temple unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> from hence
                named
                <hi>Feretrius,</hi> for the safe
                keeping
                and preserving
                of those glorious Spoils.
                And having
                so designed
                the Temple, thus bespeaks
                the gold; <hi>viz. O Jupiter Feretrius, I by this favour
                made
                a Conquerour,
                do here present unto thee
                these Royal Arms,
                and dedicate or design a Temple to
                thee
                in those Regions
                which in my mind I have marked
                out for that great purpose, to be a seat for those rich
                Spoils,
                which Posterity following
                my example, having
                slain
                Kings
                or such as do command in chief, shall present unto
                thee.</hi>
                Which formal words
                did
                so appropriate that place to the service of
                <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that afterwards
                it was
                not to be put unto other uses.
                This done
                by <hi>Romulus</hi> himself; but
                afterwards
                when <hi>Numa</hi> had
                brought
                in Religion, and that the Priesthood
                was
                established,
                though Kings
                and Consuls
                might design and dedicate, that
                is
                to say, prepare a Temple for their
                Gods
                (for so the word doth signifie
                in their antient
                Rituals)
                yet the Consecration of them
                was
                appropriated
                to the <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> and the chief Priest
                did
                usually
              
              
              
              perform that Ceremony, as appeareth
                plainly
                by the case of <hi>C. Flavius.</hi> For
                whereas by
                the Laws
                of <hi>Rome</hi> it was
                permitted
                only unto Consuls,
                or such as did
                command in
                chief, to erect Temples
                for the Gods,
                <hi>Cornelius Barbatus</hi> then chief Priest,
                was
                required
                by the people notwithstanding to consecrate the Temple of
                <hi>Concord</hi> built
                by this <hi>Flavius,</hi> though a Man of no
                publick
                Office in the Common-wealth; of which <hi>Livy</hi> thus.
                <hi>Aedem Concordiae in area</hi> Vulcani <hi>summa
                nobilium invidia dedicavit; coactus{que} consensu
                populi</hi> Cornelius Barbatus <hi>Pontifex maximus verba
                praeire, cum more majorum negaret nisi Consulem aut
                Imperatorem posse Templum dedicare.</hi>
              
              Where note, that <hi>Templum dedicare</hi> in the
                Authors
                language, is
                only to erect and prepare the Temple, and to declare unto
                what Deity it was
                intended,
                which was
                the point that formerly
                had
                been
                permitted
                only unto Kings,
                Consuls,
                and chief Commanders,
                and therefore not allowable to this <hi>C. Flavius,</hi>
                being
                a mean and private Man: and then that <hi>verba
                praeire</hi> to dictate or direct the
                words
                by which it was
                to be blessed
                and consecrated
                was
                the High Priests
                Office, which this <hi>Cornelius Barbatus</hi>
                was
                compelled
                to do by the common people, because that it
                was
                contrary to their antient
                custom to grant that honour to so mean a Man, as this
                <hi>C. Flavius.</hi> The like performed
                by <hi>Plautus Elianus</hi> being
                then chief Priest of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                in the Consecration
                of the Capitol, when the foundation of it
                was
                new laid
                in the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
                of which more hereafter; and so <hi>Vopiscus</hi>
                telleth
                us of the Emperour
                <hi>Aurelianus,</hi>
                that having
                subdued
                <hi>Zenobia</hi> the gallant Queen of the
                <hi>Palmireni,</hi> he gave
                order unto one of his Ministers
                to build a Temple with the Spoils
                of the conquered
                people: which done,
                he addeth,
                that he would write unto the Senate, <hi>ut Pontificem
                mittat qui dedicet Templum,</hi>
              
              requiring
                them
                to send the <hi>Pontifex</hi> or chief Bishop, by
                whom
                it might be consecrated
                accordingly.
                An
                Office questionless which had
                not been
                appropriated
                to the <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> if there
                had
                not been
                some certain Form, some appointed
                Ceremonies,
                accustomably
                used
                in those Consecrations,
                which none but Men
                of that high place were
                by Law to execute.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that there was
                some certain Form,
              
              some appointed
                Ceremonies,
                accustomably
                used
                by the chief Bishop upon these occasions,
                appeareth
                from that of <hi>Pompeius Festus</hi>
                an
                old Grammarian, by whom
                the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Fanum</hi> (which
                signifieth
                a Church or Temple) is
                derived
                from <hi>fando;</hi> and so derived
                upon this reason, <hi>quod dum Pontifex dedicat, certa
                verba fatur,</hi> because the <hi>Pontifex</hi> or chief
                Priest speaketh
                <hi>certain words</hi>
                (that is
                to say, a certain and set Form of
                words)
                in the Dedication. Which Form of
                words,
                or some part of them
                at the least, together with the other
                Rites
                and Ceremonies
                used
                in those Solemnities,
                I cannot better shew
                than in that Summary or Abstract of
                them

                performed
                by the Consul or chief Commander of the Army, a small fire

                the Author using
                in this place a word or term frequent in the Pontifical of
                the antient
                <hi>Romans,</hi>
                or such a word as the <hi>Roman Pontifex</hi>
                did
                use in those Dedications.
                <hi>Nam qui Templum dicabat postem tenens dare se dicebat
                Numini,</hi>
              
              <hi>quod ab illo necesse fuerat
                jam teneri,  ab humano jure discedere,</hi> i. e.
                <hi>For he that was
                to dedicate the Temple, laying
                hold on one of the Posts
                or Pillars
                of it, declared
                that he bestowed
                it upon the Deity, which by that Deity
                was
                even then to be holden
                and enjoyed,
                and to be alienated
                for ever from the right of Man.</hi> Where by the way,
                this holding
                of the Post or Pillar by the Founder,
                was
                in the name of the very <hi>Numen,</hi> to
                whom
                the Temple was
                intended;
                and was
                like the holding
                the Ring or Key of the Church-door, by
                him
                that is
                inducted
                to the cure of Souls,
                whereby he takes
                possession of it in the name of God. I have
                laid
                down these passages
                at large in the words
                of the Author, that we may see, that there
                were
                <hi>verba prisca  solennia,</hi>
                an
                antient
                and set Form of words
                accustomably
                used
                in those Consecrations;
                though the whole Form, and all the <hi>solemn
                words</hi>
                which were
                used
                therein are no where extant in my
                Authors
                for ought I can find.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are now come unto the <hi>Christians,</hi>
                where we shall find,
              
              that from their first having
                the use of Churches
                to assemble in, the Dedications
                of those Churches
                were
                in use amongst them.
                And first St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> a right godly Bishop of
                <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> speaks
                of a Church in that City, called
                commonly
                <hi>the upper Church of the Apostles,</hi>
                not called
                so, because dedicated
                to them,
                but because dedicated
                by them:
                and therefore said
                by <hi>Beda,</hi> to be <hi>Ecclesia ab Apostolis
                fundata,</hi> of the foundation of the
                blessed
                Apostles,
                because being
                given
                to them,
                for the use of the Church, it was
                by them
                dedicated
                and appropriated
                to Gods
                publick
                service. Of this we have spoke
                more at large in the last Section of the fifth Chapter of
                this Narration, and therefore shall not here repeat it. In
                the next Century we find Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
                writing
                thus in an
                Epistle to <hi>Justus Viennensis</hi> a chief Friend of
                his in the Year 158. or thereabouts.
              
              <hi>Soror nostra</hi> Euprepeia <hi>(sicut bene
                recordaris) titulum domus suae pauperibus assignavit; ubi
                nunc cum pauperibus nostris commorantes, Missas
                agimus.</hi> Our Sister <hi>Euprepeia</hi>
                hath
                turned
                her House into a Church (remember what
                was
                said
                of this, in the last Section of the sixth Chapter) for the
                use of the poor servants
                of Christ, where now abiding
                with our said
                poor Brethren, we celebrate the Mass or Sacrament of the
                blessed
                Supper. And
                in another Epistle to the same <hi>Justus,</hi> thus.
                <hi>Pastor Presbyter Titulum condidit  digne in
                Domino obiit:</hi> That is
                to say, <hi>Pastor</hi> the Priest or Presbyter,
                hath
                built
                a Church, and so died
                worthily
                in the Lord. Why we have rendred
                <hi>Titulus</hi> by the word <hi>Church,</hi> and how
                those places
                being
                at first but private Houses,
                were
                turned
                into Churches
                for publick
                use, we shall see anon; in the mean time we may take
                notice, that neither of these two
                Epistles
                have hitherto been
                questioned
                by our modern <hi>Criticks,</hi>
                nor ranked
                amongst those counterfeit <hi>Decretals,</hi>
                whose authority hath
                been
                so deservedly
                abrogated
                by the learned
                Protestants.
                In the next Century after him
                lived
                <hi>Felix</hi> the first, who entred
                on the See of <hi>Rome, An.</hi>
                272. and not long after him
                lived
                <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> succeeding
                in the same See, <hi>An.</hi>
                296. of the first of which it is
                affirmed
                by <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi>
                that he consecrated
                the House of <hi>Cecilia,</hi> and of the second by
                <hi>Damasus,</hi> that he consecrated
                the House of <hi>Lucina,</hi> making
                them
                thereby Churches
                (or places
                of Religious worship) for the use of
                Christians.
                But these being
                times
                of persecution, afford us not so clear nor so frequent
                evidences,
                as the Age next following;
                in which, the first glad sight which the
                Christians
                saw
                were
                the <hi>Encaenia,</hi> the Dedication of those
                Churches,
                which either had
                been
                taken
                from them,
                and profaned
                by Idolatry, or otherwise were
                laid
                waste, and made
                unserviceable
                in those fiery times.
                No Man more forward in this work than the
                Emperour
                <hi>Constantine,</hi> who having
                founded
                the Temple of the holy Martyrs
                in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                prepared
                himself for the <hi>ENCAENIA</hi> or Dedication of the
                same: , c. as in the Title of the
                fourth Chapter <hi>de Land. Constant. Eusebius</hi>
                hath
                it.
              
              Thus <hi>Athanasius</hi> writing
                unto the Emperour
                <hi>Constantius,</hi>
                and speaking
                of a Church not consecrated,
                prayeth
                that the Emperour
                might live to see it done,
                and celebrate the Ceremonies
                of it.
              
              <hi>Tu tamen interim Deo dilectissime</hi>
                Auguste
                <hi>vivas multos annorum recursus,  solennia
                Dedicationis perficias,</hi> as the <hi>Latin</hi>
                hath
                it. Thus not to wander into more
                particulars
                in these <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches,
                the Author of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi>
                in <hi>Eusebius</hi> telleth
                us once for all, that never
                any King but <hi>Christ</hi> had
                filled
                all Countreys
                and Cities
                of the World with these Dedications.
                <hi>Quis Rex, c. omnem locum, Regionem 
                Civitatem,</hi>
              
              <hi>tam Graecum quam</hi> Barbaricum, <hi>regalibus suis
                Palatiis, divinorum{que} Templorum Consecrationibus
                adimplevit?</hi>
              
              
              
              as the words
                there are. A matter judged
                so necessary in those early times,
                that the <hi>Arians</hi>
                charged
                it as a grievous crime on <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he
                had
                celebrated
                Divine Service in a Church not consecrated;
                for which he thus Apologizeth
                to the angry Emperour:
                <hi>Encaeniorum Festium non celebravimus religiosissime
                Auguste,
                c.</hi> And so proceeds,
                shewing
                the necessity, which did
                enforce him
                to do; namely, the incapacity
                of all other Churches
                thereabouts
                to receive the multitudes
                then assembled,
                the unresistable importunity of the people, and such other
                impulsions.
                The like clear evidence we have for the <hi>Western</hi>
                Churches,
                there being
                a Sermon of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                entituled
                <hi>De Dedicatione
                Basilicae,</hi>
              
              preached
                at the Dedication of a Church built
                by <hi>Vitalianus</hi> and <hi>Majanus,</hi> the ground of
                his Discourse taken
                from the good <hi>Centurion,</hi> of
                whom
                the <hi>Jews</hi>
                told
                our Saviour in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel,
              
              <hi>That he loved
                their Nation, and had
                built
                them
                a Synagogue.</hi>
              
              The same Father writing
                to his Sister, speaks
                of a Church which himself had
                consecrated,
                <hi>Nam cum Basilicam Dedicassem, c.</hi> And
                writing
                unto <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Como,</hi>
                invites
                him
                to the consecration of a Church then
                newly
                built
                by one <hi>Bassianus,</hi> requiring
                him
                not to fail of his being
                there, in regard that he had
                promised
                for him,
                <hi>Ne duos Sacerdotes redarguas, te qui non
                affueris,
                 me qui tam facile promiserim.</hi>
              
              The like authority we have from <hi>Paulinus</hi> also,
                another Bishop of those times,
                invited
                by <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> his especial Friend. <hi>Ad
                Basilicam quae proxime in nomine Domini
                consummabitur,</hi>
              
              <hi>dedicandum.</hi> To be present at the
                dedicating
                of a Church of his foundation, as soon as it
                was
                finished
                and made
                fit for those sacred Ceremonies.
                More of this Argument, both in the <hi>East</hi> and
                <hi>Western</hi> Churches
                we shall see hereafter, when we are come to the
                magnificent Feasts
                and great Solemnities
                used
                antiently
                by the Christians
                in these Consecrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mean time,
              
              as well for the better understanding
                of somewhat which was
                said
                before, and of some things
                that follow after, there are two
                words,
                that is
                to say, the <hi>Titulus</hi> of the
                <hi>Romans,</hi>
                and the <hi>Encaenia</hi> of the
                <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                to be considered
                and explained.
                The word <hi>Titulus</hi> in the former Section we have
                rendred
                <hi>Church,</hi> according
                to the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> notion of it:
                Churches
                being
                called
                <hi>Tituli</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi>
                Christians
                of those times,
                either because by their <hi>Dedication</hi> the name of
                Christ our Lord was
                as it were
                inscribed
                upon them
                (as the manner then was
                to set the names
                or Titles
                of the Owners
                upon their Houses
                and possessions)
                or because they gave
                a Title of Cure or Denomination to the
                Presbyters
                who officiated
                in them,
                and to whose charge they were
                committed
                at that time, as they do now unto the
                Cardinals
                in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
              
              That he assigned
                unto the Presbyters
                or Priests
                of <hi>Rome</hi> their several Churches:
                the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters
                till that time officiating
                in their turns,
                or as their Bishop did
                appointed
                them,
                in the Church Episcopal. Thus are we to understand that
                passage of <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi>
                (cited
                in the last Section of our first Chapter) where
                speaking
                of <hi>Jacobs</hi>
                anointing
                the <hi>Pillar,</hi> he telleth
                us of him,
                <hi>erexit Lapidem in</hi> Titulum, <hi>vocans eum locum
                domum Dei,</hi>
              
              that by so doing
                he erected
                the Pillar into a consecrated
                place or Church, calling
                it by the name of <hi>Bethel</hi> or the House of God. His
                meaning
                is,
                that by the anointing
                of this <hi>Pillar,</hi> the place
                did
                after get the Title of a Church, or reputation of a
                Temple, by the name of <hi>Bethel.</hi> And thus we are to
                understand that passage in the Canon Law, in which it
                is
                decreed,
                that Bishops
                shall admit none into holy Orders,
                <hi>sine merito  Titulo,</hi> that
                is
                to say, not being
                sufficiently
                qualified
                in respect of merit, and not provided
                of some Church to officiate in. For should the word
                <hi>Titulus</hi> be interpreted
                of any Academical or Civil Title, any Man
                graduated
                in the Universities,
                or dignified
                with the Title of Gent. Esquire, <hi>c.</hi> and
                otherwise of sufficiency in point of
                Learning,
                might challenge
                Orders
                from the Bishop, which was
                the thing the Canon did
                purposely
                strike at, the better to prevent the multitude of
                wandring
                clerks,
                who having
                no Churches
                of their own, would thrust themselves into other Mens
                Cures,
                to the dishonour of their Order, the great disturbance of
                the Church, and the confusion of all sacred and spiritual
                Offices.
                What inconveniences
                the gross neglect of this prudent Canon
                hath
                brought
                upon the Church in these latter
                times,
                <hi>Notius est quam ut stilo egeat,</hi>
                is
                too well known
                to be related.
                And finally,
                thus the word <hi>Titulus</hi> must be
                understood
                in the two Epistles
                of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> which before we
                spake
                of, according
                to the Ecclesiastical notion of it in those elder
                times.
                The next word here to be explained,
                is
                the <hi>Greek</hi> 
                promiscuously
                used
                both for the Act and Ceremonies
                of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> and for the celebration of the
                Feasts
                of such Dedications,
                either once
              
              
              or annually.
                The word derived
                from , which
                is
                to consecrate and devote to an
                holy use; and it is
                so taken
                in the <hi>9th</hi> Chap. to the <hi>Heb. v.</hi> 19.
                where it is
                said,
                . In the first institution of which
                Festival, as it related
                to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi>
                the days
                thereof are
                called,
                , <hi>the days
                of the Dedication of the Altar.</hi>
              
              But in the Gospel of St. <hi>John,</hi> in one word,
                , i.e. <hi>Encaenia,</hi> for so both
                <hi>Beza</hi> and the vulgar translation read it: the word
                as it denoteth
                both the Dedication,
                and the Festivals
                of it, being
                continued
                long after in the Church of Christ. A word so
                frequently
                used
                by the old <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers,
                that it occurreth
                no less than seven times
                in one Column of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
                Edition of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that
                is
                to say, in his Apology to <hi>Constantius</hi> the then
                <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour.
                More of this we shall see hereafter in some
                following
                Sections.
                Now I note only for the close,
              
              that the Dedication
                of Churches
                or places
                for Religious Worship, hath
                all the characters
                of Antiquity,
                universality and consent of people: <hi>Semper, ubique,
                 ab omnibus,</hi> as <hi>Vincentius
                Lerinensts</hi> hath
                it, which are required
                unto the knowledg
                or notification of an
                Apostolical Trandition, as this
                seems
                to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our second rank of Arguments
                to prove the high esteem which the <hi>Dedication</hi> of
                sacred places
                had
                in former times,
                is
                taken
                from the great Solemnities,
              
              the general
                concourse of people, he magnificent
                Feasts,
                used
                anciently
                by all sorts
                of Men
                on those occasions.
                First, look upon the Dedication of
                <hi>Solomons</hi>
                Temple, and we shall find, that there
                assembled
                at that time, and on that occasion, <hi>the
                Elders
                of Israel, and all the heads
                of the Tribes,
                the chief of the Fathers
                of the children
                of Israel,</hi> 1 Kings
                8.1. All the men
                of <hi>Israel,</hi> v. 2. the <hi>Priests</hi>
                and <hi>Lveites,</hi> v. 4. Nor
                were
                the Sacrifices
                short of this great Assembly,
                it being
                said,
                that <hi>Solomon sacrificed
                to the Lord</hi> 22000 Oxen
                and 120000. Sheep, <hi>v.</hi> 63. so many that they could
                not be told
                nor numbred
                for multitude, <hi>ver.</hi>
                5. Here is
                sufficient not only for a solemn Sacrifice, but a Royal
                Feast, sufficient for the entertainment of a million of
                people, and such a Royal Feast indeed
                was
                made
                by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to add the
                greater
                honour to the Dedication of of that glorious Temple. For
                so it followeth
                in the Text.
              
              <hi>And at that time</hi> Solomon
                <hi>held
                a Feast and all Israel with him,
                a great Congregation, from the entring
                in of</hi> Hamath, <hi>unto the River of Egypt, before the
                Lord our God seven days
                and seven days,
                even fourteen days.</hi>
                The second Temple, as it was
                short of this in bigness and external
                beauties,
                for which see <hi>Esr. c.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12. so fell
                it short also in the Pomps
                of the Dedication,
                the people being
                then in a low condition, impoverished
                by their long Captivity,
                and not fully
                setled.
                And yet the Scripture doth inform us,
              
              <hi>That the children
                of Israel, the Priests
                and the Levites,
                and the rest of the children
                of the Captivity, kept
                the Dedicatio of this House of God with joy. And
                offered
                at the Dedication of this HOuse of God,
                an
                hundred Bullocks,
                two hundred Rams,
                and four hundred Lambs.</hi>
                For short indeed of the magnificence of
                <hi>Solomons</hi>
                in those glorious days,
                described
                so fully
                in the 4th of the 1st of <hi>Kings,</hi>
                and yet agreeable enough to their present
                fortunes,
                as before was
                noted.
                Of the Solemnities
                and Feasts
                of the Dedication in the time of <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi>
                we have spoke
                already, and shall speak more thereof anon, that
                being
                the Original of the like Annual
                Feasts
                in the Church of Christ. Proceed we next unto the
                Dedication of this Temple when new
                built
                of <hi>Herod,</hi> of which <hi>Josephus</hi>
                telleth
                us thus. . That
                is
                to say,
              
              <hi>They celebrated
                a great Feast in honour of the restauration of the
                Temple.</hi> Which being
                told
                us in the general, he next after
                addeth,
                <hi>That the King offered</hi>
                300 <hi>Oxen
                unto God, and the rest of them,
                each one accoring
                to his ability offered
                so many Sacrifices,
                as that scarcely
                they may be comprehended
                in number, for that their multitude
                exceeded
                their estimate.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi>
                guided
                by Example or the light of Nature,
                performed
                these Dedications
                with as great solemnity, (as probably
                with as sumptuous Feasts)
                as the <hi>Jews</hi>
                had
                done
                in the times
                before them.
                Concerning
                which, besides
                what hath
                been
                said
                already, we need but look upon the Dedication of the
                Capitol, in the time of <hi>Vespasian;</hi> the pomp and
                order of it thus described
                by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> first in the way of Preamble or
                preparation.
              
              <hi>Undecimo Kal.</hi> Julias, <hi>serena luca, spatium

                ingressi milites, quibus fausta omina, felicibus Ramis.
                Dein Virgines

                is
                to say, <hi>on the 11th of the Kalends of</hi> July,
                <hi>or</hi> 21 <hi>of</hi> June,
                <hi>being
                a goodly fair day, the whole Plot of the Temple
                was
                bound
                and tied
                about with Fillets

                by the devotion of Men,
                with their divine and celestial power, the

                built,
                yet it shews
                very plainly
                withal, with what solemnity and pomp of
                Ceremonies
                the antient
                <hi>Romans</hi>

              But for the Christians
                it is
                evident and clear enough,
              
              that they were
                no sooner
                freed
                from the tyranny of persecution, in the time of
                <hi>Constantine,</hi> but they kept
                those Dedications,
                as with great Solemnties, so also with magnificent
                Feastings,
                called
                therefore ,
              
              Dedication Feasts:
                celebrated
                with a great concourse of Prelates
                and people from all parts,
                and solemnized
                with publick
                Prayers
                and eloquent
                Orations;
                one of which is

                <hi>Constantine</hi> had
                founded
                the Temple of the holy Martyrs
                in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                he prepared
                himself for the , or Dedication of the
                same, inviting
                thereunto most of the famous Prelates
                of those parts,
                all which he entertained
                and feasted
                in a sumptuous manner. Which with the pomp and other the

                reads
                it, for I have not the Original now by me. It
                was,
                saith
                he, the 14. day of <hi>September,</hi> which from that
                time forwards
                was
                annually
                kept
                holy in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by allsorts of
                people; the Church being
                then assembled
                in an
                holy Congregation, for eight days
                together. But this belongs
                more properly
                to another place, and there we shall again meet with it.
                Nor was
                the Ceremony or Religious part of these Dedicatiosn
                performed
                with less solemnity
                than with joy and Feasting;
                that part thereof belonging
                antiently
                to the Bishop, as proper and peculiar to
                him,
                and not communicable unto any of
                inferiour
                Orders;
                and that as well to add the greater
                reputation to that sacred Action, as to preserve the
                dignity and esteem of the Episcopal
                calling;
                and of this the Dedication
                of a Church in <hi>Millain,</hi>
                by St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> Bishop of that City
                spoken
                of before, may be a very fit Example, as indeed it
                is.
                A matter of so high repute, that the
                Popes
                at last began
                to draw it to themselves, that so they might the better
                correspond
                in all manner of Prerogative with the old <hi>Pontifex
                maximus</hi> in the time of the
                <hi>Romans.</hi>
                For thus <hi>Gelasius,</hi> who
                entred
                on the Popedom, <hi>An.</hi>
                492. <hi>Nobis patefactum

                factas Ecclesias, vel Oratoria sacrare praesumant:</hi> We
                are informed,
                saith
                he, that some amongst you do presume to
                <hi>consecrate</hi> Churches
                and Oratories,
                without the leave and licence of the See
                <hi>Apostolick.</hi>
                Which is
                to be understood
                with reference to the Bishop of the <hi>Roman
                Patriarchate,</hi>
                which properly
                and Originally
                were
                under his jurisdiction, as their
                proper
                Primate, and not to any other Bishops
                of <hi>Italy,</hi> much less of <hi>France,
                Illyricum,</hi> or remoter
                Countreys:
                and so we are to understand him
                in his first Epistle, inscribed
                to the Bishops
                of <hi>Lucania,</hi> another of the <hi>Suburbicarian</hi>
                Provinces,
                which made
                upon that Patriarchate, in which he
                positively
                declareth,
                <hi>Ne quis Ecclesias, non petitis pro more
                praeceptionibus, consecrare audeat,</hi> that none of
                them
                should consecrate any new built
                Church, without leave from him
                according
                to the antient
                custom; where we may note, that this restraint or
                prohibition, was
                laid
                upon the Bishops
                only, as they who only in themselves,
                were
                capable of officiating
                in that sacred Action. And being
                it was
                a sacred Action, and such an
                Action as was
                to be performed
                by none but Bishops
                in their several charges,
                I cannot doubt but that there was
                some set and appointed
                Form, in which that Action was
                then celebrated
                by those reverend
              
              
              persons;though what that Form was,
                of what particular Ceremonies,
                what Prayers
                and Benedictions
                it did
                then consist, I have not found amongst the
                Authors
                of those times,
                at least in such unquestioned Authors
                as I dare rely on.

              Our third and last rank of Arguments
                to prove the reat esteem in which these
                Dedications
                were
                held
                of old,
              
              is
                the observing
                of those Feasts
                annually
                in their several courses,
                which had
                been
                once Celebrated
                in the honour of so great a work. To this, the first hint
                given
                in the state of <hi>Jewry,</hi>
                was
                that of <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> who
                having
                kept
                the Dedication of the Altar eight
                days
                together, ordained,
                that the days
                of the Dedication of the Altar should be
                kept
                in their season from year to year, by the space of eight
                days,
                <hi>c.</hi> The like done
                also by he <hi>Romans</hi>
                in the time of their <hi>Gentilism;</hi>
              
              which whether it were
                done
                in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                or that the <hi>Jews</hi>
                took
                up this custom to hold conformity with the
                <hi>Romans,</hi>
                (who then were
                grown
                considerable in the eye of the world) it
                is
                hard to say. But for the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                sure it is
                that they observed
                the Anniversary of many of their
                Dedications
                in a Festival way; whereof, if we consult the
                <hi>Roman</hi> Kalendar,
                we shall find them
                thus disposed
                of in their several Moneths.

                Feasts
                are specified,
                as before is
                said,
                in the <hi>Roman</hi> Kalendar,
                as being
                generally
                observed.
                And others questionless there were
                of inferiour
                none, peculiar only unto certain
                Provinces
                and Cities,
                and not so universally
                received
                as the former were.
                And here we must observe
                withal, that all the Dedications
                mentioned
                in the Kalendar,
                are put down as Festivals,
                and not as memorable actions
                hapning
                on such and such a day, as some may
                possibly
                conceive. For <hi>Dempster</hi> in his Comment upon the
                Kalendar,
                reckoneth
                them
                every one as Annual Festivals,
                and gives
                this Title to the Months
                in their seeral order. <hi>De Januario  ejus diebus

                amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                and so Religiously
                observed
                both by <hi>Jews</hi>
                and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
              And being
                thus Religiously
                observed
                by the Jews
                and Gentiles,
              
              it is
                the less to be admired,
                if the Christians
                being
                a Church made
                up of both, did
                observe them
                also; grounding
                themselves especially
                upon the practice of the Jews,
                countenanced
                by our blessed
                Saviour, to which the observation of
                them
                is
                ascribed
                by <hi>Isidore,</hi> as before was
                noted;
                or had
                not <hi>Isidore</hi> given
                it for the ground thereof in the way of Position, we might
                have found it well enough by the first example of this
                kind in the way of practice. The first Anniversary Feast
                of this nature, which we find in Ecclesiastical History,
                is
                that of the 14. of <hi>September,</hi>
                held
                Annually
                in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (as before
                was
                told
                us from <hi>Nicephorus</hi>) in memory of the Dedication
                of the Church of the Holy Martyrs,
                so solemnly
                Celebrated
                by the Emperour
                <hi>Constantine,</hi> and held
                by them
                eight days
                together without intermission; which
                was
                as much as had
                been
                done
                in the <hi>Encaenia</hi> of the
                Jews,
                before remembred,
                proposed
                (no question) for their patter in that Annual Festival.
                The like occurreth
                in <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> , c.
                <hi>De Encaeniis honorandis lex vetus est, eaque praeclare
                constituta, vel potius de Templis</hi>
                (and not <hi>de rebus novis,</hi> as it
                is
                foolishly
                translated)
                <hi>per Encaenia honore complectendis.</hi>
                Not once for all, but every year by way of Annual
                remembrance. For so it followeth
                in the Author, ,
              
              <hi>Idque non semel tantum
                verum saepius, nimirum qualibet anni
                conversione
                diem eundem advehente;</hi> where we may see, that as they
                kept
                these Feasts
                Annually
                on the same day of the year, so they
                pretended
                to that Institution of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>
                for the ground thereof. The Father
                addeth
                a further reason. <hi>Ne alioqui res pulchrae progressu
                temporis evanescant, atque oblivionis
                gurgite obscuratae dilabantur;</hi> lest otherwise such
                famous things
                might be forgotten
                in long tract of time, and be at last quite
                buried
                in the grave of oblivion. There are also two
                Sermons
                of St. <hi>Austins,</hi> entituled,
                <hi>in Anniversario Dedicationis Ecclesiae,</hi>
                being
                the 152 and 153. of those <hi>De tempore.</hi> And
                howsoever that these Sermons
                inscribed
                <hi>De Tempore,</hi> have been
                suspected
                by the Learned
                Criticks
                of this Age, not to be St. <hi>Austins;</hi> yet
                <hi>Perkins</hi> running
                them
                over in particular, makes
                no exception against them,
                or either of them;
                neither do any other of the Protestant
                Doctors,
                as appeareth
                by <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Specimen Critici Sacri,</hi>
                lib. 4. c. 16. This makes
                it clear and evident,
              
              
              
              that these Anniversary Feasts
                were
                not taken
                up on the Authority of Pope <hi>Felix</hi> the fourth, (as
                some untruly
                have suggested)
                who came
                not to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> until the year 520. many
                years
                after the decease of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and some
                years
                also after the death of S. <hi>Augustine;</hi> though true
                it is,
                that by the Authority of that Pope, they
                became
                more frequent than they had
                been
                formerly,
                there being
                a Decretal to that purpose, published
                by him
                in the words
                ensuing.
                <hi>Solennitates dedicationum Ecclesiarum 
                sacerdotum
                solenniter sunt per singulos annos celebrandae, ipso
                Domino exemplum dante,</hi> c. The Feass of the
                Dedication of Churches
                and Consecration of Bishops
                (for so we understand by <hi>Sacerdotes</hi> in that place
                and time) are to be Celebrated
                yearly according
                to the Lords
                example, who went
                up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with the rest of the people, to
                solemnize the Feast of the Dedication, as the Scripture
                telleth
                us. Where we may see, that the Pope
                builds
                not this injunction on his own sole power, but as that
                power was
                countenanced
                by our Saviours
                practice. And now I am
                gone
                a little beyond my bounds
                (that is
                to say, the death of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) to which I
                had
                limited
                my self. I shall make bold to pursue this Argument so far,
                till I have brought
                these Dedication-Feasts
                to our present times.
                For <hi>Felix</hi> having
                made
                the Decretal before remembred,
                found such conformity thereunto
                in the <hi>Western</hi> Churches,
                that in the Council of <hi>Mentz,
                An.</hi>
                8 13. there was
                made
                a Catalogue of the Festival days,
                which generally
                were
                then observed,
                as <hi>Easter,</hi> the <hi>Ascension,
                Whitsontide,</hi>
                c. and in the close of all, <hi>similiter etiam
                Dedicatio Templi;</hi> where plainly
                the <hi>Encaenia</hi> or Dedication-Feasts
                of particular Churches
                is
                placed
                in no lower rank, as it relates
                to the solemnity of the same, than <hi>Easter,
                Whitsontide,</hi>
                or any other of the greater
                and more eminent Festivals.
                The like was
                also done
                in the Council of <hi>Lons, An.</hi>
                1244. where we shall find a larger
                Catalogue of Holy-days
                than we had
                before, there being
                many added
                since the Council of <hi>Mentz.</hi>
                And in that Catalogue of the Feasts
                of Festival days,
                the Dedication Feasts
                of particular Churches
                stand in the same terms
                as before they did,
                whereof see the Decretal, <hi>de
                Consecratione,

            </p>
            <p>
              Now to come nearer
                to our selves
                (that I may give some satisfaction in this point to those
                who desire it of me) there was
                a Council held
                at <hi>Oxon,</hi>
              
              
              <hi>An.</hi>
                1222. where amongst
                other Ordinances
                tending
                to the good Government of the Church, the
                Festivals
                were
                divided
                into three several ranks.
                In the first rank whereof were
                those, <hi>quae omni veneratione
                servanda erant,</hi> which were
                to be observed
                with all reverence and solemnity.
                Of the which sort were
                <hi>omnes dies
                Dominici,</hi> and all the other
                Festivals,
                yet observed
                amongst us, together with many Festivals
                of the Blessed
                Virgin, which we keep not now; and in conclusion,
                <hi>Festum Dedicationis Ecclesiae cujuslibet in sua
                Parochia,</hi> Feasts
                of the Dedication of particular
                Churches,
                which in their several Parishes
                were
                to be observed
                with the same reverence and solemnity which the others
                were.
                So also in a Synod of Archbishop <hi>Islips,</hi>
              
              who was
                promoted
                to that See, <hi>An.</hi>
                1349. it was
                decreed,
                that on the principal Feasts
                there named,
                there should be a more strict and
                precise
                restraint from work and labour than
                had
                been
                before. And among them
                we find the Dedication Feasts
                of particular Churches
                to be as high in their esteem, as any of the
                greater
                Festivals.
                By that which hath
                been
                said,
                it appeareth
                most evident, that the Dedication-Reast
                was
                to be Annually
                observed
                in each several Parish, and that it
                was
                to be observed
                as solemnly
                as any of the greater
                Festivals;
                and that it was
                to be observed
                and celebrated
                on that very day of the week, moneth,
                and year, whereon the Church was
                Consecrated
                at the first. Which being
                found to draw along with it no small inconvenience, it
                pleased
                King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>An.</hi>
                1536. to send out his Injunctions
                amongst other things
                for restraint of Holy-days.
                In which Injunctions,
                that which doth most concern this business, are these two
                particulars.
                1. That the Dedication
                of Churches
                shall in all places
                throughout this Realm, be Celebrated
                and kept
                on the first <hi>Sunday</hi> of the
                moneth
                of <hi>October</hi> for ever, and upon no other day. 2.
                That the Feast of the Patron of every Church within this
                Realm, called
                antiently
                the Church Holy-day, shall not from henceforth be
                kept
                and observed
                as an
                Holy-day, as heretofore hath
                been
                used.
                But that it shall be lawful to all and singular
                persons,
                resident or
                dwelling
                within this Realm, to go to their work, occupation, or
                mystery, and the same truly
                to exercise and occupy upon the
                said
                Feast, as upon any other workday,
                except the said
                Feast or Church Holy-day be such, as must be else
                universally
                observed
                and kept
                as an
                Holy-day by this Ordinance following.
              
              Now how far these Injunctions
                were
                observed
                in these particulars,
                whether they determined
                on the death of the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
                by whose Authority in the Convocation House they
                were
                first set out, and recommended
                to the King, I am
                not able to determine upon any certain.
              
              
              But forasmuch as I am
                able to conjecture by my own observation, or collect from
                conference
                with old people, I think the point may thus be
                stated.
                That is
                to say, that in such places
                where the day of the Dedication of the several
                Churches,
                or the Church Holy-day, as they call it now, be
                worn
                out of memory, they either are observed
                on the first <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> or the
                next <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day (which
                is
                called
                the <hi>Festum Dedicationis Ecclesiae</hi> in the
                <hi>Martyrologie</hi>)
                or not kept
                at all. But where there is
                any constant Tradition of the day or time of the
                Dedication of particular Churches,
                or of the Festivals
                of that Patron, or Tutelary Sain,
                to whose name or memory (according
                to the custom of those darker
                times)
                the said
                Churches
                had
                been
                formerly
                dedicated;
                in all such places,
                as I take it, the Festivals
                have been
                transferred
                to the <hi>Sunday</hi>
                following,
                and then observed
                with great joy and chearfulness
                in liberal entertainments,
                harmless sports,
                and manlike exercises.
                And in this estate they did
                continue in many parts
                of this Realm, by the name of the
                Feasts
                or Wakes
                of such and such places
                respectively,
                till the preciseness of some Ministers,
                and the severity of some Magistrates,
                prohibiting
                all lawful Recreations
                on the Lords
                day, brought
                them
                both out of use and credit, which
                gave
                occasion to the King to revive the Declaration of King
                <hi>James,</hi> touching
                lawful sports,
                and thereby to restore those Feasts
                to their former
                frequency; for which consult his
                Majesties
                Declaration, bearing
                date the 18th. of <hi>October,</hi> in the
                nineth
                year of his Reign, <hi>An.</hi>
                1633. But it is
                time to close this Corollary
                (somewhat extravagant I confess, but not impertinent
                altogether to my main design) and therewithal to conclude
                this Narrative of Liturgies
                and set Forms
                of worship; to the officiating
                whereof Churches,
                and Churches
                Dedicated,
                are of so great use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus have I drawn
                together for the publick
                use, what I have met
                withal,
              
              concerning
                Liturgies
                and set Forms
                of publick
                worship; that so it may appear to the sober Reader, how
                much some men
                have laboured
                to abuse the world, in making
                them
                the off-spring of the latter times.
                By this, the sober Reader may perceive, if he list to see
                it, that to draw the line of Liturgy so high, as from the
                very times
                of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                is
                nothing so unparallel'd a discourse as some
                men
                have made
                it; and that there were
                such stinted
                Liturgies
                as that, for which the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                pleadeth
                in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                time,
              
              and some time before, how strange soever they have
                made
                it. This, if it be made
                good, it is
                all I look for; because I did
                propose no further in the undertaking.
                My purpose only was,
                to draw down the descent and petigree
                of Liturgies
                and set Forms
                of publick
                worship, as far as any of the <hi>Jewish</hi> or our
                <hi>Christian</hi> Antiquaries
                could conduct me in it (taking
                the practice of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                in upon the by,) without descending
                to particulars,
                either this or that. Not that I think the Liturgy of the
                Church of <hi>England</hi>
                may not be justified
                and approved
                in all parts
                thereof, in all the Offices
                and ministrations
                comprehended
                in it; or that it may not easily
                be proved
                to be truely
                <hi>Christian,</hi>
              
              and to have nothing <hi>Roman</hi> in the whole composure;
                but that I should but <hi>actum agere,</hi> and fall upon
                a point already handled.
                The learned
                pains
                of our incomparable <hi>Hooker</hi> in this very kind,
                made
                up of so much modesty and judgment
                as that whole work is,
                hath
                too off long since those exceptions,
                which had
                been
                made
                against the several Offices,
                and whole course thereof, by those unquiet
                spirits
                who first moved
                these Controversies.
                Who so desires
                a thorow
                Vindication of it, boty for Form and matter, he may find
                it there. This which is
                done,
                in all humility I tender to the
                acceptation
                of all Orthodox and Religious men,
                whose service it was
                principally
                intended
                for; and next to the censure of the
                Supream
                Powers,
                before whose Bar the cause of Liturgy
                is
                brought
                to receive its
                sentence. If it can balance with the one, it cannot but do
                service to the other, in preservation of that Form and
                Order which hath
                made
                her glorious. However I have done
                my duty, humbly
                submitting
                the success to Almighty
                God, to whom
                be praise and glory now and evermore.

          <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
          <p>IT
            was
            about the year <hi>1636.</hi> when the Unlicensed Press, which
            had
            been
            almost out of work since the time of the old <hi>Martin
            Mar-prelat,</hi>
            began
            to teem again with a new brood of Libellous
            Pamphlets,
            the <hi>Females
            of Sedition,</hi> as a Learned
            Gentleman truly
            calls
            them;
            in which the Bishops
            were
            reproached
            with Innovating
            in the Worship of God, here by Law
            established,
            in order to some dark design to bring in <hi>Popery.</hi> The
            antient
            usages
            of the Church, grounded
            on Law, required
            by <hi>Canon,</hi> and Authorized
            by the stamp of Supream
            Authority, had
            lien so long under the Rubbish of neglect and discontinuance,
            by the remisness
            (to say no worse of it) of the former Government, that the
            endeavour of reducing
            them
            to use and practice, was
            forthwith clamorously
            branded
            with the odious name of an
            Innovation; though when it came
            unto the trial, the Innovation lay at their
            doors
            who had
            raised
            he clamor. Amongst which Innovations
            so unjustly
            charged,
            there was
            none made
            a greater
            and more general noise, than the
            requiring
            <hi>a set Form of Prayer to be used
            by Preachers
            before their Sermons,</hi>
            imputed
            by <hi>H. E.</hi> to the late Archb. as
            an
            act of his, and yet confessed
            (so much he was
            transported
            by his spleen and passion) to be
            prescribed
            in the Canon of <hi>603.</hi> full <hi>30</hi>
            years
            before that Prelate had
            attained
            the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi></p>
          <p>During these heats,
            I was
            requested
            by the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of
            <hi>W.</hi> to ease him
            of some pains,
            in searching
            into the constant practice of this Church since the
            Reformation, as to that particular; as also to consider of the
            grounds
            and motives
            which might induce the Bishops
            of those times
            to compose the Canon in which that Form
            had
            been
            prescribed;
            that haing satisfied
            himself in all points
            which concerned
            that Argument (towards
            which my poor endeavours
            were
            not likely to contribute much) he might with
            greater
            confidence require the Clergy of his
            Diocess
            to conform unto it. An
            employment which I undertook
            with a ready chearfulness,
            as one that had
            been
            always
            trained
            up in the School of obedience,
            and looked
            upon the just motions
            of my Superiors,
            as in the nature of commands.
            What satisfaction this discourse then
            gave
            unto hisLordship, I forbear to add, and what contentment it
            may give to the Reader now, I forbear to guess. The fate of
            Books
            depends
            not in these times,
            as in those before, on the capacity of the Reader, but on his
            private interess, so as it is
            not to be hoped
            that such as are approved
            by some, will be liked
            of all, though most of those who may mislike, may give no
            sufficient reason for it. All therefore which I have to do,
            is
            to submit it to
            the judgment
            of the equaland unbyassed
            Reader, from whom
            I am
            as willing to receive
            satisfaction in any controverted
            point, as to use my best endeavours
            to give it to him.
            And so good Reader, I conclude with those

              purpose, that we might certifie
              the absent, of those things
              which are most proper for their knowledge and our relation:
              They are our Messengers

              for business, our Agents
              in the managing
              and dispatch of the weightiest
              Affairs,
              such as most nearly
              do concern us; which being
              a chief Use and Benefit
              of Letters,
              no marvail,
              if they have been
              used
              in all former
              Ages,
              not only to maintain an
              intercourse between Friends
              in point of Amity, but to lay down in
              them
              our resolutions,
              as occasion is,
              in point of Controversie.
              The several Writings
              in this kind of the antient
              Authors,
              as well the Christian as the Gentile; what are they but so
              many precepts
              and directions,
              by which to regulate our Conversations,
              or reasons
              and authorities
              on the which to rest our judgments.
              Upon which ground (my most Honoured
              Lord) I have adventured
              to declare by this way of Letter what I have found upon due
              search, in answer to the proposition which your Lordship
              recommended
              to me, touching
              the Form of Prayer appointed
              in the Canon, to be used
              by Preachers
              before the Sermon. Of which, such question
              hath
              been
              made
              in these busie
              times,
              whether it ought to be by way of Invocation, as a formal
              Prayer; or else by way of Exhortation, as a
              bidding
              of Prayer: For resolution
              of the which, I shall first lay down the very Canon, and
              after briefly
              shew
              unto you what is
              most like to be the true intention of it, out of the
              publick
              Monuments
              of this Church, and constant practice of those
              men
              who are above exception for the point in
            
            
            hand, and also by such other pregnant
              reasons,
              as I have thought most proper to
              confirm the
              same.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Now for the title of the Canon, it
              runs
              thus; <hi>Can.</hi> 55. <hi>The Form of a Prayer to be
              used
              by Preachers
              before their Sermons:</hi>
              The body of it, is
              this.
          </p>
          <p><hi>Before all Sermons,
            Lectures,
            and Homilies,
            Preachers
            and Ministers
            shall move the people to joyn
            with them
            in Prayer, in this Form, or to this effect, as
            briefly
            as conveniently
            they may: Ye shall pray for Christs holy
            Catholick
            Church; that is,
            for the whole Congregation of Christian
            people dispersed
            through the whole world, and especially
            for the Churches
            of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland: <hi>And
            herein I require you most especially
            to pray for the Kings
            most excellent Majesty our Sovereign Lord,</hi> James <hi>King
            of</hi> England, Scotland, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
            <hi>Defender of the Faith, and Supreme
            Governour
            in these his Realms,
            and all other his Dominions
            and Countreys,
            over all Persons,
            in all causes,
            as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal:
            Ye shall also pray for our gracious Queen</hi> Ann, <hi>the
            noble Prince</hi> Henry, <hi>and the rest of the
            Kings
            and Queens
            Royal Issue. Ye shall also pray for the
            Ministers
            of Gods
            holy Word and Sacraments,
            as well Archbishops
            and Bishops,
            as other Pastors
            and Curats:
            Ye shall also pray for the Kings
            most honourable Council, and for all the Nobility and
            Magistrates
            of this Realm, that all, and every of those in their several
            callings,
            may serve truly,
            and painfully,
            to the Glory of God, and the edifying
            and well-governing
            of his people, remembring
            the accompt they must make. Also ye shall pray for the whole
            Commons
            of this Realm, that they may live in true Faith and fear of
            God, and humble obedience to the King, and Brotherly Charity
            one to another. Finally,
            let us praise God for all those that are already
            departed
            out of this life in the Faith of Christ, and pray unto God,
            that we may have grace to direct our
            lives
            after their good examples,
            that this life ended,
            we may be made
            partakers
            with them
            of the glorious Resurrection in the life everlasting:
            Always
            concluding
            with the Lords
            Prayer.</hi></p>

            So far the Letter of the Canon, in which there
              was
              not any purpose, nor in the makers
              of the same, to introduce into the Church any Form of Prayer
              or Invocation, save those which
              were
              laid
              down in the Common prayer Book; (nor indeed could they if
              they would, the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
              being
              still in force) but to reduce her
              Ministers
              to the antient
              usage of this Church, which had
              been
              much neglected,
              if not laid
              aside. The Canons
              then established
              were
              no late Invention, as some give it out, but a Collection of
              such Ordinances
              and pious Customs
              as had
              been
              formerly
              in use since the Reformation; which
              being
              scattered
              and diffused
              in several Injunctions,
              Orders,
              and Advertisements,
              published

              assembled,
              or otherwise retained
              in continual practice, was

              1603. drawn
              up together into one body, and by his Majesty then
              being
              Authorized
              in due form of Law: And being
              so Authorized
              by his Majesty, the Canons
              then made
              had
              the force of Laws,
              and were
              of power to bind the Subjects
              of all sorts
              according
              to their several and respective
              concernments,
              as fully
              and effectually
              as any Statute, or Act of Parliament can bind the Subject of
              this Realm, in their goods
              and properties:
              For which consult the Statute, 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 19.
              and the practice since. Which as it may be
              said
              of all, so more particularly
              of the Canon now in question, of which it
              is
              to be considered,
              that the main body of the same had
              been
              delivered
              formerly
              almost <hi>verbatim</hi> in the
              Queens
              Injunctions,
              published
              by her Royal and Supream
              Authority, in the first year of her Reign, <hi>Anno</hi>
              1559. which I will therefore here put down, that by
              comparing
              both together, we may the better see the true intention of
              that Canon; and what is
              further to be said
              in the present business.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            The Queens
              Injunction is
              as followeth.
              The title this: <hi>The Form of
              bidding
              the Prayers
              to be used
              generally
              in this uniform sort;</hi> and then the body of it
              is
              this: <hi>Ye shall pray for Christs holy
              Catholick
              Church, that is,
              for the whole Congregation of Christian people,
              dispersed
              throughout the whole world, and
              especially
              for the Churches
              of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland: <hi>and herein I
              require you most especially
              to pray for the Queens
              most excellent Majesty,
              our Soveraign
              Lady</hi> Eliz. <hi>Queen of</hi> England, France
              <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>Defender of the Faith, and
              supream
              Governour
              of this Realm, as well in causes
              Ecclesiastical as Temporal: You shall also pray for the
              Ministers
              of Gods
              holy Word and Sacraments,
              as well Archbishops
              and Bishops,
              as other Pastors
              and Curats:
              Ye shall also pray for the Queens
              most honourable Council, and for all the Nobility of this
              Realm: That all, and every of these in their
              callings
              may serve truly
              and painfully,
              to the glory of God, and edifying
              of his people, remembring
              the accompt they must make: Also you shall pray for the
              whole Commons
              of this Realm, that
            
            
            
            they may live in true faith, and fear of God, in humble
              Obedience; and brotherly Charity one to another:
              Finally
              let us praise God for all those that are
              departed
              out of this life in the faith of Christ, and pray unto God,
              that we may have grace to direct our
              lives
              after their good example, that after this life, we may be
              made
              partakers
              of the glorious resurrection
              in the life everlasting.</hi> These are the very
              words
              of the <hi>Injunction,</hi> wherein it
              is
              to be observed,
              that as the Canon hath
              relation to this Injunction, so neither this
              Injunction,
              nor any thing therein enjoyned
              was
              of new erection, but a Reviver only of the usual Form which
              had
              been
              formerly
              enjoyned
              and constantly
              observed
              in King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              days,
              as we shall see by looking
              over the Injunction published
              (and the practice
              following
              thereupon) in the said
              Kings
              Reign.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Now the Injunction of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6.
              is
              in this Form following:
              The Title thus, <hi>The Form of
              bidding
              the Common prayers:</hi>
              and then the Form it self: <hi>You shall pray for the whole
              Congregation of Christs Church, and
              especially
              for this Congregation of</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
              <hi>wherein first I commend to your devout
              prayers
              the Kings
              most excellent
              Majesty, supreme Head immediately
              under God, of the Spiritualty, and Temporalty of the same
              Church, And for Queen</hi> Katharine <hi>Dowager, and also
              for my Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>and my Lady</hi> Elizabeth,
              <hi>the Kings
              Sisters:
              Secondly
              you shall pray for my Lord Protectors
              grace, with all the rest of the
              Kings
              Majesties
              Council: for all the Lords
              of this Realm, and for the Clergy, and
              Commons
              of the same; Beseeching
              Almighty God to give every one of
              them
              in his degree, Grace to use themselves in such wise, as may
              be to Gods
              glory, the Kings
              honour, and the weal of this Realm:
              Thirdly
              you shall pray for all them
              that be departed
              out of this world in the faith of Christ, that they with us,
              and we with them
              at the day of Judgment,
              may rest both Body and Soul with</hi> Abraham, Isaac
              <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This
              was
              the Form first published
              in the beginning
              of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and it
              continued
              all his time, save that the latter clause
              was
              altered,
              and that for praising.
              God for Saints
              departed
              put instead thereof, as we may see in Bishop
              <hi>Latimers</hi>
              Sermon preached
              at <hi>Stanford,</hi> whereof more anon.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Hitherto are we clear for King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              time, and no less clear are we for King
              <hi>Henries</hi>
              also, especially
              for the latter part thereof, in which the use of
              <hi>Bidding</hi>
              prayers,
              or <hi>moving</hi>
              the people unto prayer had
              by him
              been
              imposed
              upon the Clergy, before this time the people
              had
              been
              trained
              up in a very gross ignorance, not
              knowing
              explicitely
              the Articles
              of their belief, accustomed
              to a <hi>Latin</hi> service in their
              publick
              Churches,
              and to a daily stint of <hi>Pater-nosters,</hi>
              and <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue which
              few or none of them
              understood.
              But that King, having
              taken
              on himself the Title of <hi>supreme</hi> Head of the Church
              of <hi>England,</hi> and adding
              of the same to the stile Imperial, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1535,
              there issued
              out an
              order by his Authority
              in this Form that followeth.
              <hi>This is
              an
              Order taken
              for Preaching,
              and Bidding
              of Beads</hi>
              in all Sermons
              <hi>to be made
              within this Realm.</hi> First, <hi>Whosoever shall Preach in
              the presence of the Kings
              Highness, and the Queen's Grace, shall in the
              bidding
              of Beads
              pray for the whole Catholick
              Church of Christ, as well quick as dead, and
              especially
              for the Catholick
              Church of this Realm, and first, as we be most
              bounden,
              for our Soveraign
              Lord King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> VIII.
              <hi>being
              immediatly
              next under God the only supreme Head of this
              Catholick
              Church of</hi> England. <hi>And for the most gracious
              Lady</hi> Qu. Anne <hi>his Wife, and for the Lady</hi>
              Elizabeth <hi>Daughter and Heir to
              them
              both. And no further.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Item <hi>the Preacher in all other
            places
            of this Realm, not in the presence of the
            Kings
            said
            Highness, and the Queens
            Grace, shall in the bidding
            of the</hi> Beads,
            <hi>pray first in manner, and Form, and word for word as
            is
            above ordained,
            and limited:
            Adding
            thereto in the second part, For all
            Archbishops,
            and Bishops,
            and for the whole Clergy of this Realm, And
            specially
            such as the Preacher shall name of his devotion; And
            thirdly
            for all Dukes,
            Earls,
            Marquess's, and for all the whole Temporalty of this Realm,
            and specially
            for such as the Preacher shall name of devotion: And
            finally
            for the souls
            of all them
            that be dead, and specially
            for such as it shall please the Preacher to name.</hi> So far
            the very words
            of the <hi>Injunction,</hi> as it
            relates
            unto the business now in hand, which
            differs
            very little, if at all, in Form and fashion (though there be
            some difference in the matter) from those which
            followed
            in the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            both of which out of question took
            their hint from hence.</p>
          <p>
            
            Besides
              it is
              to be observed,
              that the said
              King having
              assumed
              unto himself the stile, and Title of <hi>supreme Head</hi>
              of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as before
              is
              said,
              did
              before this, by Proclamation dated
              <hi>June</hi> 9. <hi>An.</hi>
              1534. declare, and signifie
              his Royal pleasure, that all, and all manner of
              Ecclesiastical persons
              should teach, preach, publish,
            
            
            and declare in all manner of Churches,
              the said
              his just Title, Stile, and Jurisdiction,
              on every Sunday, and high Feast throughout the year, which
              after was
              enjoyned
              in the Injunction of the year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536, set out
              by the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> being
              then Vicar General, with the Kings
              authority: As also in the <hi>Injunctions</hi>
              of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. <hi>An.</hi>
              1547. which again was
              revived
              in the Queens
              Injunctions,
              <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. As after in the first Convocation of
              King <hi>James</hi> in the year 1603. And
              besides
              this, it was
              appointed
              in the said
              Injunctions
              of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. that the Preacher or Parochial
              Priest should every Sunday, in the Pulpit rehearse
              distinctly
              the <hi>Lords
              prayer,</hi> the <hi>Articles
              of the Creed,</hi> and the <hi>ten
              Commandments</hi>
              in the <hi>English</hi>
              Tongue, for the better instructing
              of the people in their duties
              both to God and Man, which being
              ordered
              at the same time as the bidding
              of the <hi>Beads</hi>
              in the <hi>Forni</hi> spoken
              of before, was
              first enjoyned,
              shews
              plainly
              the intention and effect of both, to be no other than to
              instruct the people in the principles
              of faith and piety. So that as well to teach the people how
              to pray, and what things
              they chiefly
              were
              to pray for, in the publick
              meeting,
              as to make known
              unto them
              the Kings
              just Title, by which they were
              to recommend him
              in their devotions,
              the Form before remembred
              of <hi>Bidding
              prayers,</hi>
              or <hi>Beads</hi>
              was
              prescribed
              the Priests,
              by them
              to be proposed
              unto the people in their several
              Sermons:
              For instance of the which, in point of practice in the
              said
              Kings
              time, we need but look upon a Sermon of Bishop
              <hi>Latimers</hi>
              (being
              that before the Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. which
              was
              the 28. of King <hi>Henries</hi>
              Reign) In which being
              entred
              on his matter, as the use then was,
              he thus <hi>bids</hi>
              the prayers.
              <hi>That all that I say shall, may turn to the glory of God,
              your Souls
              health, and the edifying
              of Christs Body. I pray you all to pray with me unto God,
              and that also in your Petitions,
              you desire that these two things
              he vouchsase to grant us. First a mouth for me to speak
              rightly:
              next Ears
              for you, that in hearing
              me, you may take profit at my hands,
              and that this may come to effect, you shall desire
              him
              unto whom
              our Master Christ bad, we should pray,
              saying
              even the same prayer which Christ himself
              did
              Institute. Wherein we shall pray for our Sovereign Lord the
              King, chief, and</hi> supreme Head <hi>of the Church of</hi>
              England <hi>under Christ, and for the most excellent,
              gracious, and vertuous
              Lady, Queen</hi> Jane <hi>his most lawful Wife, and for all
              his, whether they be of the Clergy, or Laity, whether they
              be of the Nobility, or else other his Grace's
              Subjects;
              humbly
              beseeching
              Almighty God, that every one of us, even from the
              highest
              to the lowest,
              may in his degree, and Calling,
              earnestly
              endeavour to set forth the glory of God, and the
              Gospel of his
              Son Christ Jesus, that so living
              in his fear, and love, we may in the end of our
              days
              depart out of this life in his friendship and favour. For
              these graces
              and what else his wisdom knoweth
              more needful for us, let us pray, as we are
              taught,
              saying:
              Our Father,</hi> c. Put all that
              hath
              been
              said
              together. and the sum is
              this. That if we do interpret the <hi>Canon</hi> of the year
              1603. by the Queens
              <hi>Injunctions,</hi>
              and construe both of them,
              according
              to the Injunctions
              in King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              and King <hi>Henries</hi>
              days,
              we shall see plainly,
              that the <hi>Form of prayer</hi>
              appointed
              by the <hi>Canon</hi> is
              no new Invention,
              neither obtruded
              on the Church by the Bishops
              of these times,
              on a design to stint the Spirit (as some now give out) or on
              a like design of Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and the
              Prelates
              of his time (as is
              said
              by others:) but carried
              and transmitted
              from hand to hand, since the very first
              beginning
              of the Reformation; nor did
              it stand thus only in point of Law, not
              being
              reduced
              unto practice, but stood
              thus also in the practice of our
              Predecessors
              (though not so frequently
              in these last as the former times)
              as shall be presently
              made
              good by Witnesses
              and Proofs
              of unquestioned
              credit.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Mean while the <hi>Canon,</hi> and
              <hi>Injunctions</hi>
              being
              laid
              together, there will be little difference found between
              them,
              in sum, and substance (except that
              <hi>praying
              for the dead,</hi> used
              in the latter times
              of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and the
              beginning
              of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6.
              hath
              since been
              changed
              into praising
              God for their departure
              in the faith, and Gospel of our Lord and Saviour) and at all
              nothing in the Form, or any circumstance considerable in the
              present business: for if we look upon the prayer therein
              appointed,
              we shall find these four things
              to be considered.
              1. The substance, or matter of it
              being
              the heads
              therein recited,
              <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Catholick</hi>
              Church, the Kings
              Majesty, the Qu. the Royal issue, the L <hi>Ls.
              spiritual,</hi> and <hi>temporal.</hi> 2. The phrase, or
              garb of speech, wherein the matter
              is
              expressed
              in <hi>those words,</hi>
              or <hi>in other to the same effect.</hi> 3. The quantity of
              time, which is
              allowed
              for those expressions,
              <hi>as briefly
              as conveniently
              we may:</hi> and last of all the <hi>Form</hi> thereof,
              being
              the point that is
              most in question, which plainly
              is
              to be by way of <hi>exhortation;</hi> Ye <hi>shall
            
            
            
            pray,</hi> and I require you most
              especially
              to <hi>pray;</hi> and not by way of Invocation, with
              an
              immediate address to Almighty God, as
              Men
              use it now: Therefore as in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, and the
              Queens
              <hi>Injunctions</hi>
              it is
              called
              a <hi>Bidding
              of Prayers:</hi>
              the <hi>Form of bidding
              prayers
              generally
              to be used
              after this uniform sort,</hi> and the Form of
              <hi>bidding</hi>
              the Common Prayers.
              The Form of <hi>bidding
              the Beads</hi>
              in King <hi>Henries</hi>
              Injunction; So in the <hi>Canon</hi> it
              is
              called
              a <hi>Moving:</hi>
              it being
              therein ordered,
              that before all Sermons,
              Lectures
              and Homilies,
              Preachers
              and Ministers
              shall <hi>move</hi> the people to
              joyn
              with them
              in prayer, <hi>c. Bidding</hi>
              and <hi>Moving,</hi>
              are two words,
              but to one effect; for when we <hi>bid</hi> the people pray,
              we <hi>move</hi> them
              to it: and in the Congregation, we have no way to
              <hi>move</hi> the people but by that of
              <hi>bidding,</hi>
              or <hi>exhorting.</hi>
              Prayer as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> hath
              defined
              it, , is
              requiring
              of some good from the hands
              of God, and doth imply a punctual, and immediate address
              unto him,
              which is
              the peoples
              office to the Lord Almighty: <hi>Bidding</hi>
              of <hi>prayer,</hi> as the <hi>Injunctions,</hi>
              or <hi>moving</hi>
              Men
              to pray, as the <hi>Canon</hi> hath
              it, is
              the Priests
              office to the people: wherein he not only
              exhorts
              them
              to the performance of that Duty, but
              layeth
              them
              down a Summary, and brief recital of those
              things,
              which they are to pray for as members
              of that one mystical Body, whereof <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
              is
              the Head: Now where it is
              alledged
              by some, who have turned
              <hi>Bidding</hi>
              into <hi>Praying,</hi>
              that in the <hi>Canon</hi> it is
              not ordered
              precisely,
              that Ministers
              shall <hi>move</hi> the people to
              joyn
              with them
              in prayer, in this Form, that followeth,
              but only in <hi>this Form,</hi> or <hi>to this effect.</hi>
              It's true, what they alledge
              as unto the words,
              though not as to the use they make thereof: For by these
              words
              to this effect, the Church hath
              no intent, or meaning,
              to give Men
              liberty to devise new Forms
              of Prayer, nor indeed could she if she would (as before we
              noted)
              or to desert as well the usage of those
              Men,
              which had
              been
              most obedient to her publick
              Orders,
              as the Injunctions,
              on the which, the said
              use was
              founded:
              Wherefore these words,
              <hi>to this effect,</hi> must have no reference to the Form,
              and manner of expression (for it
              is
              called
              in the <hi>Canon</hi> a <hi>moving
              of the people to joyn
              in prayer</hi>) but only to the
              words
              and phrase, it being
              not the Churches
              purpose to bind her Ministers
              precisely
              to the words,
              which are there laid
              down, but that in that very Form of
              words,
              or other words
              to that effect, they should <hi>move</hi> the people to be
              mindful of those particular Heads,
              for which they were
              to joyn
              with him
              at the close of all in the <hi>Lords
              prayer,</hi> as appeareth
              plainly
              by that passage of the Prayer in Bishop
              <hi>Latimers,</hi>
              spoken
              of before.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            That this, and none but this was
              the Churches
              meaning,
              will be easily
              proved,
              and made
              apparent by the practice of the
              chiefest,
              and most eminent persons;
              who are called
              by <hi>Aristotle</hi> .
            
            For those who have the best authority to
              interpret
              <hi>Canons</hi>
              (I mean my <hi>LLs.</hi> the two
              Archbishops,
              with the greater
              part of the Bishops)
              have and do use no other Form than that of
              <hi>Bidding</hi>
              or of <hi>Moving.</hi>
              And so do also many antient
              Doctors,
              both in the Universities,
              and Cathedral Churches;
              who being
              originally
              accustomed
              to the Form of <hi>Bidding,</hi>
              have not yet turned
              their stile to a Form of <hi>Praying:</hi>
              But since to speak of those, who are now alive, may
              possibly
              be subject to misconstruction, we will take Counsel with the
              dead, whose actions
              of this kind may be our example, and their
              proceeding
              in this point our warrant: of these I will make instance of
              five alone (though I could in more) all of the
              <hi>Hierarchie,</hi>
              all Men
              of high esteem in their several
              times,
              and therefore such as may be followed
              with most safety in the present business: Of these the last
              in course of time was
              the most Learned
              Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> of whom,
              to say no more, we may say with safety, that he
              was
              <hi>Canonum observantissimus,</hi> who
              being,
              as he was,
              a practised
              Preacher long time before and after the
              making
              of the said
              <hi>Canon,</hi> did
              use no other Form of Prayer, than that of
              <hi>Bidding:</hi>
              All those, that heard
              him
              cannot but confess,
              that so it was,
              and in the body of his Sermons
              collected
              by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
              that now is,
              and my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> that then
              was,
              there are some Tracts,
              and footsteps
              of it, which make it evident unto those that
              heard
              him
              not. For this consult
              his 3d Sermon in <hi>Lent, Anno</hi> 1593. his sixth in
              <hi>Lent</hi> 1596. his sixth for
              <hi>Whitsuntide,
              Anno</hi> 1613. More specially
              in his second of the <hi>holy Ghost, Anno</hi> 1608. in
              which immediately
              upon the division of his Text, as his custom
              was,
              he thus <hi>moves</hi>
              the people, or which both comes
              to one, he thus <hi>bids</hi>
              the prayers.
              <hi>But for that there is
              no speaking
              of the Spirit, without the Spirit, nor
              bearing
              neither; to the end, that hearing,
              and speaking
              he may help our infirmities,</hi>
              c. And in his ninth
              Sermon of the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> 1617. the division
              ended,
              as before, he thus proceeded:
              <hi>That these be done,
              and that they may be done,
              and that those things
              which shall be spoken,
            
            
            may tend to this, that they may be
              done,</hi>
              c. Which last two passages
              being
              preambles,
              or introductions
              unto his form of <hi>bidding
              Prayers,</hi>
              give us an
              hint of that which we may find laid
              down at large in his Latine
              Sermons
              extant in his <hi>opuscula,</hi>
              collected
              by the same most Reverend Prelates;
              particularly
              in that before his Sermon Preached
              <hi>pro forma,</hi> when he went
              out Doctor, and that at the departure of the Prince
              <hi>Elector Palatine;</hi> in both of which, he
              calls
              upon his Audience to joyn
              with him
              in Prayer by way of <hi>bidding,
              moving,</hi>
              or <hi>inviting,
              Invitemus huc numen, precemur, preces offeramus,</hi> and
              such like phrases:
              All which thus laid
              together, do most plainly
              shew
              that he did
              go that way, which was
              prescribed
              by the Injunctions,
              revived
              and ratified
              in the Canon, and travel'd
              by those Worthies
              that went
              before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            I mean to instance next in Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> who
              lived
              and flourished
              after the setting
              out of the Queens
              Injunctions,
              and dyed
              long time before the making
              of the <hi>Canon:</hi> In a collection of his
              Sermons
              by <hi>John Garbrand</hi> of <hi>Oxon,</hi>
              Printed
              1583. there are these three passages,
              which declare most plainly
              how he did
              understand the said
              Injunction,
              one giving
              light unto the other. Of these, the first
              occurs
              in that upon the first of <hi>Haggai,</hi> where
              having
              spent
              two leaves
              upon the entrance to his matter, and
              made
              division of his Text, we find it in a line by it self, and a
              different character, this word <hi>Pray,</hi> and that
              noting
              out the place in which his Form of
              <hi>bidding
              prayer</hi> was
              at that time used:
              More fully
              in his Sermon upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. where
              having
              entred
              on his matter, he thus moves
              the people, or as the Stile then
              was,
              thus <hi>biddeth
              the Prayers.
              But before I proceed to declare further that which
              is
              to be spoken
              at this present, let us turn our bearts to God, even the
              Father of lights,
              that it may please him
              to open the Eyes
              of your understanding,
              and to direct all our doings
              to his Glory.</hi> Most fully,
              and indeed as fully
              as may be to this purpose, in that on <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.15.
              where having
              read his Text, he doth thus move the people to
              joyn
              in prayer. <hi>That it may please God so to order both my
              utterance and
              your understanding,
              that whatsoever shall be spoken
              or heard,
              may turn to the glory of his holy name, and to the profit
              and comfort of his Church. Before I enter into the
              exposition
              of these words,
              I desire you to call upon our gracious God with your
              earnest
              and hearty prayer; and here I commend unto you
              Gods
              holy Catholick
              Church, and therein the Queens
              most excellent Majesty, by the especial grace of God, Queen
              of</hi> England, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>Defender
              of the true, antient,
              and Apostolick
              Faith, and the highest
              Governour
              next under God of this Church of</hi> England, <hi>c.
              that as God of his mercy hath
              marvellously
              preserved
              her to the possession of her right, to the great comfort of
              all her Subjects
              hearts,
              and to the Reformation
              of the Church, so it may please
              him
              to aid and increase her with his holy Spirit, to the
              continuance and performance of the same. The
              Queens
              most Honourable Council, with the residue of the Nobility;
              the good Estate of both of the Universities,
              and all other Schools
              of Learning,
              the only Nurseries
              of this Realm; the Bishops
              and Preachers,
              that the number of them
              may be increased,
              and that they may have grace to set forth the truth of
              Gods
              Gospel, as their duty is,
              diligently,
              sincerely,
              soberly,
              timely, and faithfully:
              And the whole Commons
              of this Realm, and specially
              such as speak ill, or think ill of
              Gods
              holy Word, that they may have grace to regard the Salvation
              of their Souls,
              to lay aside all blind affection, to hear the Word of God,
              and so to come to the Knowledge of the truth.</hi> This
              is
              the Form by him
              then used,
              which plainly
              is
              by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> not of <hi>Invocation,</hi>
              a <hi>Form of Bidding
              prayer,</hi> according
              as it is
              prescribed
              in the Injunction, and no direct prayer, with
              address to God,
              as is
              now devised
              against the Injunction and the Canon. And here it
              is
              to be observed,
              that in this Form of Bishop <hi>Jewels,</hi>
              there is
              not only a conformity to the Injunction, that
              is
              by <hi>Bidding</hi>
              and <hi>Exhorting</hi>
              only, but that therein he recommends
              unto them
              those particular heads
              which in the said
              Injunction are contained,
              the last excepted:
              As for the words,
              or phrase of speaking,
              he useth
              not the same precisely,
              which are laid
              down in the Injunction, but other
              words
              amounting
              to the same effect; which also sheweth,
              that whatsoever liberty is
              given
              us in the Canon by these words,
              or to this effect, by no means
              giveth
              us any power to change the <hi>Form</hi> of
              <hi>moving,
              bidding,</hi>
              or <hi>exhorting,</hi>
              but only sheweth
              to what effect they must, and may <hi>bid, move,</hi> or
              <hi>exhort</hi> the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next in order of Ascent (for so we purpose to proceed)
              is
              Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> the first Archbishop of
              <hi>Canterbury</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
              Reign, who being
              Pro-vice-chancellor of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in King
              <hi>Edwards</hi>
              time, and preaching
              at the Funeral (there) of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> in the
              conclusion of his Sermon, doth thus begin his Exhortation
              <hi>ad preces</hi> (as it is
              there called)
              or (which comes
              both to one) doth thus bid the prayers.

              This I have here set down in the
              Latine
              tongue, according
              as I find the same in the <hi>opera Anglicana</hi> of the
              said
              <hi>Martin Bucer, pag.</hi> 898. which if it be
              compared
              with the Kings
              Injunctions,
              will manifestly
              appear to be conform thereto in each particular (the special
              recitation of the Kings
              Sisters,
              the <hi>Protectours
              Grace,</hi> the Clergy and Nobility
              being
              all included,
              though cut off with, <hi>c.</hi>) and
              cometh
              also very near to that of Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> before
              remembred,
              both of them
              keeping
              to the Form of <hi>bidding,
              moving,</hi>
              or <hi>exhorting,</hi>
              but taking
              to themselves
              the liberty of their own expression for the phrase and
              stile, according
              to the purpose
              and effect of the said
              Injunction. And it is
              worth our noting
              too, that presently
              upon the end of this <hi>exhortation, or
              bidding
              of the Prayers,</hi>
              used
              by Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> there followeth
              in the book these words,
              <hi>Hic factae sunt tacitae preces.</hi> By all which we may
              perceive most evidently,
              that it was
              then the peoples
              practice, and is
              now our duty immediately
              upon the <hi>bidding
              of the Prayers,</hi>
              or on the Preachers
              moving
              of the people to joyn
              with them
              in Prayer, as the Canon hath
              it, to recollect the heads
              recommended
              to them,
              and tacitly
              to represent them
              to the Lord in their devotions,
              or otherwise to comprechend them
              in the <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> with which the Preacher, by
              the Canon, is
              to close up all.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            And now being
              come to the times
              of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, we will next look on
              Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> the fourth of these five
              Prelates,
              whom
              before I spake
              of, who living
              in King <hi>Henry</hi> and King
              <hi>Edwards</hi>
              times,
              and in their times
              using
              that Form of <hi>bidding
              Prayers,</hi>
              which is
              prescribed
              both in the Canon and Injunctions,
              shews
              plainly,
              that the antient
              practice in this kind was
              every way conform to the present Canon, and the old
              Injunctions.
              And first to keep our selves
              to King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              Reign, we have eight passages
              in his Sermons,
              preached
              in that Kings
              time, whereby we may perceive
              what the usage was,
              six of them
              laid
              down in brief, and two more at large; the two last
              being
              as a comment on the former six; of the six brief, the first
              occurs
              in his 2d.
            
            Sermon before King <hi>Edward</hi> thus: <hi>Hitherto
              goeth
              the Text, That I may declare this the better to the
              edifying
              of your Souls,
              and the glory of God, I shall desire you to pray,</hi>
              c. So in his third before the King,
            
            <hi>March</hi> the 22. <hi>Before I enter further into this
              matter, I shall desire you to pray,</hi> c. And in the
              fourth, <hi>March</hi> 29. <hi>That I may have grace so to
              open the remnant of this Parable, that it may be to the
              glory of God, and edifying
              of your souls,
              I shall desire you to pray, in the which prayer,</hi>
              c. And in the 5th. Sermon before the King on the 6th.
              of <hi>April,</hi>
            
            having
              entred
              on his matter, he thus invites
              them
              to their Prayers:
              <hi>And that I may have grace,</hi> c. So in the sixth,
              <hi>April</hi> the 13th. <hi>This
              is
              the story, and that I may declare this Text, so as it may be
              to the honour of God, and the edifying
              of your souls
              and mine both, I shall desire you to help me with your
              prayers,
              in the which,</hi> c. The last
              is
              in a Sermon before that King,
            
            Preached
              at the Court in <hi>Westm. An.</hi>
              1550. where he doth it thus, <hi>Here therefore I shall
              desire you to pray,</hi> c.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            These instances
              compared
              with the other two, make the matter plain, whereof the first
              is
              in the seventh
              before King <hi>Edward,</hi> April 19. 1549. Thus, This day
              <hi>we have in memory</hi> [Christs] <hi>bitter passion, and
              death, the remedy of our Sin. Therefore I intend to treat of
              a piece of the story of his passion; I
              am
              not able to treat of all: that I may do this the better, and
              that it may be to the honour of God, and the edification of
              your Souls
              and mine both, I shall desire you to pray,</hi> c.
              <hi>In this prayer,</hi> I shall desire you <hi>to remember
              the</hi> Souls
              departed
              <hi>with laud and praise to Almighty God, that he
              did
              vouchsafe to assist them
              at the hour of their death:</hi> I shall desire you to pray,
              <hi>c.</hi> And in the which, <hi>c.</hi> What
              mean these <hi> caetera</hi>'s? That we shall see most
              manifestly
              in his Sermon Preached
              at <hi>Stamford,</hi>
            
            Octob.
              9. 1550.
            
            
            which shews
              indeed most fully;
              that the Form of <hi>bidding
              Prayers</hi>
              then used,
              was
              every way conform to the Injunction of King <hi>Edward</hi>
              VI. and very near the same, which
              was
              prescribed
              after by the Queens
              Injunction. For having
              as before proposed
              his matter, he thus <hi>bids
              the Prayers.
              And that I may at this time so declare
              them,
              as may be for Gods
              glory, your edifying,
              and my discharge, I pray you to help me with your
              prayers;
              in the which prayer,</hi> c. <hi>For the Universal
              Church of Christ through the whole world,</hi> c.
              <hi>for the preservation of our Sovereign Lord King</hi>
              Edward <hi>the Sixth, sole Supreme Head under God, and
              Christ, of the Churches
              of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>c.
              Secondly,
              for the Kings
              most honourable Council. Thirdly,
              I commend unto you the Souls
              departed
              this life in the Faith of Christ, that ye remember to give
              laud, praise, and thanks
              to Almighty God for his great goodness and mercy
              shewed
              unto them
              in that great need and conflict against the Devil and Sin,
              and that gave
              them
              in the hour of death faith in his
              Sons
              Death and Passion, whereby
              they conquer, and overcome, and get the victory: Give
              thanks
              I say for this, adding
              prayers
              and supplications
              for your selves,
              that it may please God to give you like faith, and grace to
              trust only in the death of his dear Son, as he
              gave
              unto them:
              For as they be gone,
              so must we, and the Devil will be as ready to tempt us, as
              he was
              them,
              and our sins
              will light as heavy upon
              us, as theirs did
              upon them,
              and we were
              as weak and unable to resist as
              were
              they. Pray therefore that we may have Grace to die in the
              same faith, as they did,
              and at the latter day to be raised
              with</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and be
              partakers
              with Christ in the Kingdom of Heaven, for this and all other
              graces,
              let us say the Lords
              prayer.</hi>

          <p>
            
            Now unto Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> we will
              joyn
              another of the same time, and as high a
              calling,
              which is
              Dr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> of
              whom,
              whatever may be said
              in other respects,
              in this it cannot be objected,
              but that he followed
              the Form and Order then prescribed;
              for in a Sermon Preached
              before King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <hi>Anno</hi> 1550.
              being
              the Fourth of that Kings
              Reign, before the naming
              of his Text, for ought appears,
              he thus <hi>bids
              the Prayer. Most honourable Audience, I purpose by the grace
              of God to declare some part of the Gospel, that
              is
              accustomably
              used
              to be read in the Church at this day, and that, because
              without the special grace of God, neither I can speak any
              thing to your edifying,
              nor ye receive the same accordingly,
              I shall desire you all, that we may
              joyntly
              pray all together
              for the assistance of his grace. In which prayer I commend
              to Almighty God your most excellent Majesty our Sovereign
              Lord, King of</hi> England, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
              <hi>and of the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
              <hi>next and immediately
              under God here on earth Supream
              Head, Q.</hi> Katharine <hi>Dowager, my L.</hi> Maries
              <hi>grace, and my L.</hi> Elizabeths
              <hi>grace, your Majesties
              most dear Sisters,
              my L.</hi> Protectors
              <hi>grace, with all others of your most honourable Council,
              the Spiritualty and Temporalty. And I shall desire you to
              commend unto God with your prayers,
              the Souls
              departed
              unto God in Christs Faith, and among those most
              especially
              our late Sovereign Lord King</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>your most
              noble, Father; for these, and for grace
              necessary, I
              shall desire you to say a</hi> Pater-nosler, <hi>and so
              forth.</hi> Which Form of his agrees
              most exactly
              with that order in the Kings
              Injunction, not altered
              then in that clause, <hi>for the
              Saints
              departed;</hi>
              which (as it seems)
              continued
              till the alteration of the publick
              Liturgy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. and then
              was
              changed
              with the same: In other things
              no difference
              between him
              and that other Form, which was
              commanded
              and set forth by the Queens
              Injunction, and between him
              and Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> so little, that it may seem to
              be in words
              more than meaning:
              In both we have a clear and pregnant evidence, that then
              they used
              no proper and direct address to God in a formal Prayer of
              their own devising,
              but only laid
              before the people some certain heads
              they were
              to pray for, which in the Language of that time
              was
              called
              <hi>Bidding
              of prayer.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            
            We should now look upon the practice in King
              <hi>Henries</hi>
              days,
              but that I think no question can or will be
              made
              in that particular, considering
              the severe temper of that Prince in
              exacting
              full obedience unto all his Mandates;
              or if there be, that Form of Prayer which we find
              used
              by Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> in his Sermon
              Preached
              before the Convocation,
              in the 28th. of that Kings
              Reign (which before we spake
              of) may serve once for all without further
              Instances,
              which brings
              the precept and the practice to the like Antiquity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put all that hath
              been
              said
              together, and the sum is
              this: That if we do interpret the Canon of the year 1603. by
              the Queens
              Injunctions,
              and construe both of them
              according
              to the Injunctions
              in King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              and King <hi>Henries</hi>
              days,
              seconded
              by the constant practice in all
              times
              succeeding,
              we shall see plainly,
              that in the intention of the Church we are to use no Prayer
              before our Sermons
              by way of Invocation to God, but somewhere in
              them,
              or before them
              to use a Form of <hi>Bidding
              prayer</hi> by way of Exhortation to the Auditory: This
              said,
              we will declare in brief how the new
            
            
            
            Form of Prayer by way of Invocation, and address to God
              (which is
              now generally
              taken
              up) came
              in use amongst us, and afterwards
              lay down some reasons,
              not so much to oppose that Form of Invocation
              lately
              taken
              up, as to establish and confirm the other Form of
              <hi>Bidding
              prayers,</hi>
              founded
              upon the Canon, the Injunctions,
              and the antient
              practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Now this new Form of Invocation, to deal
              plainly
              in it, was
              first contrived
              and set on foot by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, who
              labouring
              with might and main , as the
              saying
              is,
              to overthrow the publick
              service of this Church, then by Law
              established,
              endeavoured
              to advance in the place thereof
              an
              Arbitrary and Extemporary
              Form of Prayer, of every ptivate
              mans
              devising,
              and that not only before, but after Sermon. <hi>Calvin</hi>
              had
              so appointed
              in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Knex</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
              and rather than
              not have it so in <hi>England</hi> also, the Brethren
              were
              resolved
              to put all in hazard.
              This when they could not compass with their noise and
              clamour, they fell upon
              a way which came
              somewhat near it, and was
              more likely far to effect their
              purpose. Their
              Lecturers
              and Preachers,
              yea, and followers
              too, not coming
              to the Church till the Service ended,
              and their own Prayer was
              to begin. The Book of <hi>dangerous
              practices</hi>
              and <hi>positions,</hi>
              writ as was
              thought by Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (though not then a
              Bishop,) will give us some of those
              examples;
              take one among them
              for a tryal,
              and you shall find him
              boast himself, that every <hi>Sabbath</hi> (so he
              called
              it) not medling
              with the Liturgy prescribed
              he used
              to Preach unto his people, <hi>Ego singulis
              sabbatis, si
              non alius adveniens locum suppleat (cum praescript
              liturgias formula nihil habens commercii)
              in coetu concionem
              habeo.</hi> What he professed
              for himself was
              then the practice of them
              all (some of them
              as it is
              observed
              in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
              being
              content to walk in the Church-yard till Sermon time, rather
              than to be present at publick
              prayer) and is
              still, I fear used
              by many Lecturers
              in and about the City of <hi>London.</hi> Thus
              having
              limited
              all Gods
              Service unto Preaching,
              and some Extemporary Prayer of their own
              devising,
              they brought
              the people at last unto this persuasion, that in the
              publick
              Liturgy there was
              nothing but a meer
              formality which the Law enjoyned.
              Their Arbitrary and Extemporary
              Forms
              of Prayer savouring
              only of the Spirit, and true devotion, which when they could
              not bring about at the first attempt, they
              practised
              with a counterfeit Devil to undertake it: The seven of
              <hi>Lancashire,</hi> when they were
              taught
              by Mr. <hi>Darrel</hi> to play the
              <hi>Demoniacks,</hi>
              were
              also taught
              by him
              to promote the
              cause. As often as any of those
              Ministers,
              who were
              conformable to the Church, and kept
              themselves unto the Forms
              of the publique
              Liturgy, did
              come to visit them,
              and in their hearing
              read some Prayers
              out of the Common-prayer Book, the Devil
              was
              as quiet as any Lamb, as if he were
              well pleased
              with that Form of Service,
              or that there was
              not any thing in those Prayers,
              or the men
              that used
              them,
              to trouble him
              or disturb his peace. But when as Mr. <hi>Darrel</hi> and
              other Brethren of the Non-conformity
              approached
              in sight, who used
              to fall upon him
              with whole volleys
              of raw and indigested
              Prayers
              of their own devising
              (such as they had
              prepared
              and fitted
              for the present occasion) then were
              the wicked Spirits
              much more troubled,
              and perplexed
              extreamly,
              whereby you may perceive, that even the
              <hi>Puritans</hi>
              also had
              a kind of Holy-water, with which to fright away the Devil,
              lest else the <hi>Papists</hi>
              should in any thing have the start before
              them.
              And whereas the Injunction had
              restrained
              the Clergy to some certain heads
              by them
              to be commended
              to the Peoples
              prayers,
              these men
              took
              neither care of the Form, or matter of the
              said
              Injunction; not of the Form, for they
              directed
              their address to Almighty God in manner of a formal prayer,
              as hath
              since been
              used
              against the Canon; nor of the matter of the same, for they
              began
              their Prayer with a long confession, or a discourse rather
              of their own uncleanness,
              and the corruption of mans
              nature, fill'd it with praise and thanksgiving for
              particular
              blessings,
              even for their Godly friends
              and acquaintance, and ended
              it with a kind of a <hi>charm</hi> or
              <hi>transubstantiating,</hi>
              as viz. That <hi>the words
              which they should speak, might not be
              entertained
              as the words
              of a mortal man, but as they were
              indeed the words
              of the immortal and living
              God.</hi> (For in that very stile I have
              heard
              it often) nay, they went
              so far in the end, that the <hi>Visitation of the Sick</hi>
              prescribed
              by the Church was
              quite laid
              aside, their weak estate being
              reduced
              unto that prayer also. Those which
              were
              dangerously
              ill, or but ill at ease, sending
              their Bills
              abroad to several Preachers,
              by them
              to be remembred
              in their Pulpit prayers.
              Hereto they also had
              reduced
              particular
              Thanksgivings
              for the recovery of such persons
              as had
              been
              visited
              with Sickness, or had
              escaped
              any present danger of what inferiour
              rank soever it were,
              which grew
              so common at the last (and in late
              times
              too,) that being
              once to Preach in the Church
            
            
            of <hi>Westminster,</hi> before many of the Nobility, and
              many other persons
              of great note and honour, the Verger there
              brought
              me a Ticket in these words,
              <hi>viz.</hi> N. N. <hi>of the Parish of St.</hi>
              Martins,
              <hi>Shooe-maker,
              having
              lately
              had
              a dangerous fall, and now being
              pretty well recovered,
              desires
              this Congregation to give thanks
              for him.</hi>
              So that this Prayer of theirs became
              at last the , the general
              plaister
              for all sores,
              the common receptacle
              for all sutes,
              the universal comprehension of all pious
              offices:
              The Service of the Church being
              thought mean while to be ineffectual; nay, by I know not
              what strange means
              it found such entertainment among
              them
              also, who otherwise were
              not ill affected
              unto the order of the Church, that in the end the usual
              <hi>Form of prayers</hi>
              was
              in a manner laid
              aside by all sorts
              of men,
              and is
              now forced
              to plead its
              Birth-right, and seek for repossession as <hi>ex post
              liminio,</hi> which it doth as followeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            And first it may be pleaded
              from the antient
              practice, not of our Church alone since the Reformation,
              which is
              done
              already; but of all Churches
              in all times,
              in which there is
              no <hi>constat</hi> of any Form of Prayer by way of
              Invocation used,
              or to be used
              before the
              Sermon, Lecture, Exercise, or Homilies,
              call it what you will: The exposition of the Law in
              <hi>Ezras</hi> time, which was
              a <hi>Lecture</hi> at the least, if not a Sermon,
            
            was
              nakedly
              delivered
              without any prayer, so were
              the Sermons
              of the Prophets.
              Our Saviours
              Sermon on the Mount had
              no Prayer before it, that we can meet with;
            
            but there was
              in it questionless a <hi>Bidding
              of Prayers,</hi>
              and a particular Form laid
              down, after which
              to pray; for it is
              said
              there, we shall pray after this manner: those of the
              Apostles
              also were
              delivered
              in the self same manner, though in those
              times
              in the which no publick
              Liturgy was
              as yet universally
              agreed
              upon, a formal Prayer before the Sermon might be thought,
              more necessary. In the next Ages,
              when as the Church was
              setled,
              and certain Forms
              of Prayer prescribed
              (made
              either by the Apostles
              or Apostolick
              men)
              we find not any for this purpose: Nor
              is
              there only a <hi>non liquet</hi> of it in the
              publick
              <hi>formulas,</hi> but nothing to be found, which
              reflects
              that way in any of the Sermons,
              Homilies,
              or Expositions
              of the Antient
              Doctors
              either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine.</hi>
              As for the later
              times,
              when as the service of the Church
              was
              brought
              unto that Form wherein it now continues,
              for the most part in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Sermon
              commonly
              was
              an
              enarration, or an
              explication of the Gospel, for the day
              appointed,
              or otherwise some of the Homilies
              of the Holy Fathers,
              and needed
              no much preparation thereunto, as
              is
              now required.
              Nor doth that use continue only in the Church of
              <hi>Rome,</hi> but also in the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
              Churches
              (as they call them)
              as appeareth
              plainly
              by the Writings
              of <hi>Dietericus,</hi> and other
              Doctors
              of that party. A thing so universally
              received
              among them,
              that in the alteration of Religion
              made
              in <hi>Brandenburg,
              Anno</hi> 1614. It was
              declared
              by the Elector amongst other things;
              <hi>Evangeliis,
               Epistolis, quae diebus Dominicis explicantur 
              quotannis repetuntur, Pastores
              non ita astrictos esse debere, ut ipsis non liceat alium
              aliquem insignem textum biblicum praelegere,  pro
              concione
              tractare;</hi> By which we may perceive that in the
              <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches
              the Sermons
              are no other than a brief enarration of, or on the Gospel,
              and Epistle for the day appointed,
              and so but little need of preparatory
              Prayers,
              as before I noted;
              so that as not of old in the former
              times,
              so neither in the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
              Churches,
              or any others of the Reformation, which retain any Tract, or
              footstep of the antient
              Liturgies
              (as God be thanked
              here we do) is
              there a shew
              of any thing (that I can meet with) to countenance and
              conclude a set Form of Prayer made
              before the Sermon
              according
              to the Preachers
              own conceptions,
              either in prescript or in practice. <hi>Geneva</hi> which
              first bred
              it, doth alone retain it, and those which on her
              commendations
              have since took
              it up.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Next we may argue for the Form of
              <hi>Bidding
              Prayers,</hi>
              that at the first, when it was
              introduced
              into the Church, it rather was
              a part of the very Sermon, one of the Principal
              instructions
              therein delivered,
              than any preparation to it: In the
              Injunctions
              of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it
              is
              commanded
              that the Curates
              should in their Sermons,
              or Collations,
              declare unto the People the Kings
              Supream
              Authority, for which end especially,
              the use of <hi>Prayers</hi>
              seems
              to me to be first ordained,
              and being
              so ordained,
              and withal brought
              into a Form (as it still continueth)
              it was
              for ought we know at the Preachers
              pleasure to bring it in into his Sermon, where he thought
              most fit, Ten times
              at least in Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> we find this
              <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Bidding
              Prayers.</hi>
              In the first whereof being
              that before the Convocation, he
              spends
              three leaves
              and more ere he comes
              unto it; two almost in the 2. and 6. before King
              <hi>Edward.</hi> Eight almost, being
            
            
            
            well near half his Sermon in that before that King at
              <hi>Westminster, Anno</hi> 1550. and in the other six he
              doth not use it till he be entred
              on his matter, as by what hath
              been
              said
              before doth at full appear; Nay by the Rule
              laid
              down in the Queens
              <hi>Injunction,</hi> it seems
              it was
              not to be used
              till the end of the Sermon: and therefore no such necessary
              <hi>preparation</hi> to it, as it
              is
              now conceived,
              and made.
              For presently
              on the conclusion of the said
              Form of <hi>Bidding
              prayers,</hi>
              it followeth
              thus in the <hi>Injunction: And this
              done,
              shew
              the holy-Days,
              and Fasts.</hi>
              This by our present
              Liturgy (confirmed
              in Parliament before the setting
              out of the said
              <hi>Injunctions</hi>)
              is
              ordered
              to be done
              after the Homily, or Sermon: and might seem
              inconvenient,
              if not absurd, should it be done
              in the middle of the Sermon, much more between the Prayer,
              and the Sermon, which also seems
              to have been
              put to practice
              in King <hi>Edwards</hi>
              time: Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> not descending
              to the <hi>Bidding
              of prayers</hi>
              (or to his Exhortation <hi>ad preces,</hi> as it
              is
              there called)
              till he was
              come to the conclusion of his matter in the close of all.
              Now where the <hi>Canon</hi> hath
              appointed,
              that the Form of Prayer there recited
              be used
              by Preachers
              before the Sermon,
              <hi>i. e.</hi> before the substance of it (the preface and
              division being
              only a <hi>manuduction</hi>
              thereunto, and no parts
              thereof) as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>
              always
              used
              it, or else between the Text, and Sermon, as others no less
              eminent than he have been
              accustomed
              to do: Or if it must needs
              be interpreted
              to be before them
              both, as the most would have it, we must then think the
              Church was
              pleased
              to yield a little unto the current of the time, in which
              that fashion generally
              had
              been
              taken
              up: And that the Church regarded
              not so much the circumstance as the main and substance,
              which was
              to lay before the people <hi>some
              heads
              of prayer,</hi> and thereby to cut of those long, and
              tedious prayers,
              so much used
              of late, under
              pretence whereof so many <hi>Widows
              houses
              had
              been
              devoured,</hi>
              and all the <hi>publick
              service</hi> of the Church neglected.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Thirdly
              it may be pleaded,
              that the old Form of <hi>Bidding
              prayers</hi>
              is
              more agreeable
              to the Law, than their new Form of <hi>Invocation,</hi>
              which is
              expresly,
              and directly
              against the same: For in the Statute 2. and 3. of King
              <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. as
              afterwards
              in the first of Queen <hi>Elizabeth Cap.</hi> 20. (whereas
              afterwards
              in the first of Queen <hi>Elizabeth Cap.</hi> 20. (wherein
              the <hi>Common-prayer-book</hi> now in use
              was
              confirmed,
              and established:)
              It is
              enacted,
            <q>That if any manner
              of Parson, Vicar, or whatsoever Minister, that ought, or
              should sing, or say <hi>Common prayers,</hi>
              c. shall wilfully,
              or obstinately
              standing
              on the same, use any other <hi>Rite, Cermony, Order,
              Form,</hi> or manner of celebrating
              the <hi>Lords
              Supper</hi>
              openly,
              or privily,
              or Mattens, Even-song, administration of the
              Sacraments,
              or other <hi>open prayer [N. B.]</hi> than
              is
              mentioned,
              and set forth in the said
              Book, He shall lose, and forfeit to the
              Queens
              Highness, her Heirs
              and Successours,
              for his first offence the profits
              of all his spiritual Benefices,
              and Promotions,
              coming,
              and arising
              in one whole year next after his conviction, and also for
              the same offence shall suffer imprisonment by the space of
              nine Months
              without bayl,
              or mainprise, c.</q>
            and so from one punishment unto
              another, until at last they come on the third offence, to
              Deprivation, and imprisonment
              perpetual. Now lest there should be any doubt, what
              is
              here meant
              by <hi>Open prayer,</hi> The said
              two Statutes
              thus expound it:
            <q><hi>Open prayer</hi> in and throughout this Act
              is
              meant,
              that prayer, which is
              for others to come unto, and hear either in common
              Churches
              or private Chappels,
              and Oratories,
              commonly
              called
              the <hi>service of the Church:</hi></q>
            so as it seemeth
              by this Statute, that whosoever
              useth
              in the Church any <hi>open prayer,</hi> i. e. such prayer as
              is
              made
              for other Men
              to come unto, or hear, which is
              not mentioned
              or set forth in the <hi>Common-prayer book,</hi>
              makes
              himself subject unto all the penalties
              in the same conteined:
              which thing considered
              as it ought, it is
              not to be thought, that in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1603.
              the Church did
              order, or permit by the aforesaid <hi>Canon</hi> any
              <hi>Form of prayer,</hi> or <hi>Invocation,</hi> which
              was
              repugnant to the Statutes
              standing
              still in force, but only purposed
              to continue the usual Form of <hi>Bidding
              prayer,</hi> or <hi>exhortation</hi>
              unto Prayers,
              which was
              agreeable thereto.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            In the 4th rank the very place it self
              comes
              to be considered,
              in which this Prayer of theirs is
              made,
              which of all places
              else is
              most improper for that action, and least
              intended
              to it by the Church. <hi>Pulpits</hi>
              were
              made
              of old for publick
              speeches
              to the people and not for Prayers
              unto the Gods;
              the <hi>Pulpit</hi> for Orations
              being
              often
            
            
            mentioned
              in <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers
              (call it <hi>Suggestum, rostrum, pulpitum,</hi> or what else
              you will) but never any mentioned
              in them,
              as a place for Prayer: And so in sacred
              matters
              also, the <hi>Pulpit</hi> hath
              been
              used
              for publishing
              the Law in reference to <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> whence it
              first was
              published;
            
            and for the preaching
              of the Gospel in reference to the <hi>Mount,</hi> where it
              was
              first preached,
              and for the denouncing
              of Gods
              Judgments
              on the Disobedient, in reference to <hi>Mount Ebal,</hi>
              whence the Curse was
              threatned:
              But that the <hi>Pulpit</hi> should be
              used
              as a place to <hi>pray</hi> in, when there are other
              places
              destinate to that holy Use, was
              never heard
              of, as I think, till these later
              Ages,
              when all things
              seemed
              to tend to Innovation; Sure I am
              in the Church of <hi>England</hi> there
              was
              no such meaning;
              for in the 83. <hi>Canon,</hi> it
              is
              ordained,
              that <hi>the Parishioners
              shall provide a comely and decent Pulpit, to be set in a
              convenient place, and to be there seemly
              kept
              for the preaching
              of Gods
              Word:</hi> Nothing else in the <hi>Canon</hi>
              is
              expressed,
              but only <hi>preaching
              of Gods
              Word;</hi> and therefore I may safely
              say nothing else was
              meant:
              especially
              there being
              another seat appointed
              for the <hi>publick
              prayers,
              Can.</hi> 82. For further proof of which, let us but look
              unto the <hi>Rubrick</hi>
              before the Commination where is
              said,
              as followeth.
              <hi>After Morning prayer, the people
              being
              called
              together by the tolling
              of a Bell, and assembled
              in the Church, the</hi> English Letany <hi>shall be
              said
              after the accustomed
              manner, which ended,
              the Priest shall go into the Pulpit and say thus.</hi> Here
              seems
              to be another Use of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi>
              besides
              that of <hi>preaching,</hi>
              but indeed it is
              not. The threatnings
              of Gods
              Judgments
              being
              many times
              as necessary to, and for Gods
              people, as the endearments
              of his mercies,
              and both the preaching
              of his Word: Now whereas after the
              said
              Commination there are some certain reconciliatory
              Psalms,
              or Prayers,
              that follow after; those are not to be
              said
              within the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> but where the Letany
              had
              been
              said
              before; for so it is
              declared
              in the next <hi>Rubrick.
              Then shall they all kneel upon their
              knees,
              the Priest, and Clerk kneeling,
              where they are accustomed
              to say the</hi> Letany, <hi>shall say this Psalm:</hi> which
              plainly
              shews,
              that in the intention of the Church, the <hi>Pulpit</hi>
              was
              not made
              for a place for the Priest to <hi>pray in,</hi> but rather
              for a place wherein to teach the people, how they
              were
              to pray, which is
              the <hi>Bidding
              prayers</hi>
              in the <hi>Canon</hi> meant.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            The same may be concluded
              also even from the posture of the Preacher
              being
              in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> for <hi>Pulpits</hi>
              being
              made
              as before was
              said,
              for Speeches,
              Sermons,
              and Orations
              unto the people, the Speaker, Orator, or Preacher
              was
              of necessity, or ordinary Course, to turn himself unto the
              people, that so they might the better both see, and hear
              him,
              as in such things
              is
              still accustomed;
              whereas in times
              of Prayer, the Priest, or Minister, ought to turn his face
              to the upper end of the Church,
              looking
              towards
              the <hi>East,</hi> and so his back to be
              towards
              the people; I say that so he ought to do, at least if he
              intend to follow either the prescript of this Church, or
              most true antiquity. The Christians
              of <hi>Tertullians</hi>
              time were
              generally
              accused
              for <hi>worshipping
              the Sun,</hi> because that in their
              prayers
              they turned
              their faces
              to the <hi>East: Inde suspicio quod innotuerit nos ad
              Orientis regionem precari:</hi>
            
            as he there informs
              us where <hi>(nos)</hi> no question
              was
              not meant
              of the people only, but of Priest, and people. And for the
              Church of <hi>England,</hi>
            
            it is
              appointed
              in her <hi>Rubrick</hi>
              that <hi>at the reading
              of the Lessons
              the Minister which reads,
              shall stand, and turn him
              so, as he may be best heard
              of all such as be present;</hi> which
              shews
              plainly,
              he was
              to look another
              way, when he said
              the Prayers:
              And lest it may be said,
              that the other way was
              not directly
              from the people, but askew upon
              them
              (which yet would ill become
              the Preacher) we find it among other
              things
              objected
              by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction in Queen
              <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
              time, not only that the Ministers
              did
              say some part of Divine Service within the Chancel, where he
              must needs
              look askew upon them,
              but that at other times
              his face was
              turned
              away from them
              altogether: whereof see <hi>Hooker l.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi>
              30. which makes
              me wonder by the way, that all, or most part of our
              <hi>pews</hi>
              should be of late so placed,
              that contrary both to the Churches
              Order, and the
              antient
              practice, the Minister, when he
              readeth
              the Prayers,
              looks
              downwards
              towards
              the lower end of the Church, and not unto the <hi>East,</hi>
              as he ought to do; so then the Preacher in the
              <hi>Pulpit</hi> turning
              himself unto the people, and making
              himself the object of their Eyes,
              as he of their attentions,
              cannot be thought to pray to God, but if he pray at all, to
              the people rather: and on the other side, the Form of
              <hi>Bidding
              prayers</hi>
              being
              by way of Exhortation, and so purposed,
              doth fit as well the <hi>posture</hi> of the Preacher, as it
              doth the <hi>place.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            
            Lastly,
              the Form of <hi>Bidding
              prayers,</hi>
              stands
              more with the intention of the Church,
            
            
            
            than that of <hi>Invocation,</hi> because it doth avoid some
              inconveniences,
              and absurdities
              which do arise upon the other; For first, whereas the Church
              prescribes
              a <hi>set Form of prayer</hi> in her
              publick
              Liturgy, from which it is
              not lawful for any of her Ministers,
              either to vary, or recede; she did
              it principally
              to avoid all unadvised effusions
              of gross and undigested prayers,
              as little capable of piety, as they are
              utterly
              void of Order, and this she did
              upon the reason given
              in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council, <hi>viz.</hi> lest else
              through ignorance, or want of Care, any thing should be
              uttered
              contrary to the Rule of Faith, <hi>ne forte aliquid contra
              fidem, vel per ignorantiam vel per minus
              studium sit
              compositum,</hi> as the <hi>Canon</hi>
              hath
              it: But were
              men
              suffered
              to enjoy a liberty of Praying,
              and saying
              what they listed
              before their Sermons,
              in vain had
              the Church bound
              us to set Forms
              of prayer in the common Liturgy, upon several
              penalties,
              when men
              might afterwards
              run riot how they pleased
              in their particular prayers
              before their
              Sermons,
              without blame or censure: And though perhaps in some
              Churches
              of the Reformation, in which there
              is
              no publick
              Liturgy, or set Form of Divine Service, to which both Priest
              and people, are obliged
              to conform themselves, it may be lawful for the Preacher to
              use such prayers
              both before and after Sermon, as the consideration of that
              great work, and the necessities
              of the people may invite him
              to; yet it is
              otherwise with us in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where
              all these points
              are carefully
              provided
              for in the Book of <hi>Common-prayers,</hi>
              which in these other Churches
              are made
              the Subject of the Preachers.
              Now where some men
              conceive they obey the <hi>Canon,</hi> in case they pray in
              that Form, or <hi>to that effect,</hi> those who do so
              conceive it, shew
              in their deeds,
              that they as little care for the effect, as for the Form, we
              plainly
              see by the effects,
              what that <hi>effect</hi> of theirs would tend to, what
              is
              the issue of that liberty, which most
              Men
              have taken:
              too many of that sort, who most stand upon it,
              using
              such passages
              in their prayers
              before their Sermons,
              that even their <hi>prayers</hi>
              in the <hi>Psalmists</hi>
              language are <hi>turned
              into Sin:</hi> And for the brevity therein
              required
              [as <hi>briefly
              as conveniently
              they may</hi>] they neglect that also: and study to spin out
              their prayers
              to a tedious length against all convenience.
              Besides,
              whereas the Church intendeth
              nothing more in her publick
              <hi>Canons</hi>
              than an
              <hi>uniformity</hi> in Devotion,
              this leaving
              men
              to themselves in such a special part of
              Gods
              publick
              Service as that now is
              made,
              would bring in a Confusion, at the least a
              <hi>Dissonancie,</hi>
              and so, destroy that blessed
              Concord, which the Church most aims
              at: Both which absurdities
              or inconveniences,
              call them
              what you will, are happily
              avoided
              by that Order of <hi>Bidding
              prayers,</hi>
              by the Church intended.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            A third, and greater
              inconvenience, than the other two, which would, and doth
              arise from that Form of Prayer by way of
              <hi>Invocation,</hi> is
              that, it doth accuse the <hi>publick
              Liturgy</hi> as insufficient, and defective: For
              were
              it thought that the Confession in the Service-book, and
              those particular Prayers,
              Collects,
              Hymns,
              Thanksgivings,
              and Ejaculations,
              which are therein used,
              were
              either perfect in themselves, or
              acceptable
              unto God, to what end should we add a prayer of our own
              devising?
              that were
              to light a Candle before the Sun, and therefore they that
              stand upon it, do in effect, as much as if a man should say,
              my Friends,
              and Brethren make no account of any thing, which you hear
              from the <hi>Common-prayer-book,</hi> in which
              is
              nothing to be found but the voice of Man, but
              hearken
              unto me, and by me what the Churches
              say to the Spirit; or as a <hi>Puritan Tradesman</hi> once
              served
              my old Chamber-fellow Mr. <hi>L. D.</hi>
              meeting
              one time by chance at Dinner, my Chamber-fellow
              being
              the only Scholar in the Company,
              was
              requested
              to say Grace, which he did
              accordingly;
              and having
              done,
              the <hi>Tradesman,</hi> whom
              before I spake
              of, lifting
              up both his <hi>hands,</hi>
              and <hi>whites</hi>
              to Heaven, calls
              upon them,
              saying,
              <hi>Dearly
              beloved
              Brethren, let us praise God better;</hi> And thereupon
              began
              a long Grace of his own conceiving.
              The case is
              just the same in the present business: Nor
              had
              those Men,
              who first invented
              those new Forms
              of Prayer, obtruded
              them
              so easily
              upon the Church, but that withal they
              laboured
              to persuade weak Men,
              and did
              persuade them
              at the last, that questionless such
              prayers
              were
              better, and more powerful far than any by the Church
              appointed:
              Now all this fear of bringing
              down the reputation of the Liturgy,
              and practising
              to advance our private prayers
              above the publick,
              are easily
              avoided
              by that <hi>Bidding
              of prayers</hi>
              enjoyed
              by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.
              and before that, in use in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
              as doth appear most plainly
              in King <hi>Henries</hi>
              time, and therefore questionless it
              was
              the meaning
              of the <hi>Canon,</hi> that it should continue. And
              being
              it was
              the meaning
              of the <hi>Canon,</hi> of them
              that
            
            
            made
              it, that the said
              <hi>Form of Bidding
              prayers</hi>
              (for avoiding
              the inconveniences
              and mischiefs
              before recited)
              should be still continued;
              the Prelates
              of the present times,
              have greater
              reason to see it carefully,
              and duly
              put in execution, by how much the
              mischiefs
              and inconveniences,
              arising
              from neglect thereof, and from the liberty which some
              Men
              take unto themselves of praying
              what, and how they list in the <hi>Congregation,</hi>
              are now more sensibly
              apparent than ever formerly.
          </p>
          <p>Other absurdities,
            or inconveniences
            in this kind I could produce, but that these few may serve as
            a taste for the rest, and I am
            loath to go beyond the compass of a <hi>Letter,</hi> although
            I cannot but be fearful, that I have
            passed
            the bounds
            thereof already: However I was
            willing rather to trespass somewhat on good
            manners,
            than to be wanting
            in the least degree to your desire:
            Beseeching
            you as favourably
            to accept, those Considerations,
            as they are chearfully

          <p>THE
            Quarrels
            and Disputes
            about Episcopacy had
            reposed
            a while, when they broke
            out more dangerously
            than in former times.
            In order whereunto the people must be put in fear of some dark
            design to bring in <hi>Popery;</hi> the
            Bishops
            generally
            defamed
            as the principal Agents,
            the regular and establisht
            <hi>Clergy</hi> traduc'd as the subservient
            Instruments
            do drive on the Plot: Their actings
            in Gods
            publick
            Worship charged
            for Innovations;
            their persons
            made
            the Common subjects
            of reproach and
            calumny. The News
            from <hi>Ipswich, Bastwicks</hi> Let any, and the Seditious
            Pamphlets
            from <hi>Friday-street</hi> (with other the like
            products
            of those times)
            what were
            they but <hi>Tentamenta
            Bellorum Civilium,</hi> preparatory
            Velitations
            to that grand encounter, in which they
            were
            resolved
            to assault the Calling?
            The Calling
            could not be attempted
            with more hopes
            of Victory than when it had
            received
            such wide wounds
            through the sides
            of those persons
            who principally
            were
            concerned
            in the safety or defence thereof.</p>
          <p>The way thus opened,
            and the <hi>Scots</hi>
            entring
            with an
            Army to make good the pass; the <hi>Smectymnuans</hi> come
            upon the Stage, addressing
            their discourse in Answer to a Book
            called
            <hi>An
            Humble Remonstrance</hi> to the
            Lords
            and Commons
            in Parliament Assembled,
            <hi>Anno 1640.</hi> amongst whom
            they were
            sure beforehand of a powerful party to advance the Cause,
            which made
            them
            far more confident of their good suocess, than otherwise they
            had
            reason to expect
            in a time less favourable. And in this Confidence they
            quarrelled
            not the Rocket or the Officers
            Fees,
            the Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> the Vote in Parliament, or the
            exorbitant jurisdiction of the High-Commission, at which old
            <hi>Martin</hi> and his followers
            clamoured
            in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
            time: <hi>Non gaudet tenui sanguine tanta sitis.</hi> Their
            stomach was
            too great to be satisfied
            with so small a sacrifice as the
            excrescences
            and adjuncts
            of Episcopacy, which seemed
            most offensive to their Predecessors.
            They are all now for Root and Branch, for the very
            Calling,
            that having
            grubbed
            up those goodly Cedars
            of the Church, the Bishops,
            they might plant a stinking
            Elder (as a noble person well observed)
            in the place thereof. Never was
            Learning
            so employed,
            to cry down the encouragements
            and rewards
            of Learning.
            The Branches
            needs
            must wither when the Root decays,
            and what could else befall Cathedras (as we see it too
            evidently)
            but the inevitable exposing
            of them
            to a present ruin, by making
            them
            Oblations
            unto Spoil and Rapine?</p>
          <p>
            And now or never was
              the time for those that had
              a care of the Churches
              safety, to put themselves into a posture of defence, and be
              provided
              for the Battel.
              In which if few appeared
              at the first on the Churches
              side, it was
              not that they durst
              not give the onset, but that they
              were
              reserved
              for succours.
              For whilst the Humbly
              reverend Remonstrant was
              pleased
              to vindicate as well his own as the
              Churches
              honour, there was
              small cause, or rather none, that other
              men
              should interpose themselves at all, or rob
              him
              of the glory of a sole encounter. <hi>Parque novum fortuna
              videt concurrere Bellum atque virum,</hi> as in a case not
              much unlike was
              observed
              by <hi>Lucan.</hi> But when that Reverend pen
              grew
              wearied,
              not with the strength or number of his
              Adversaries,
              but their importunity, who were
              resolved
              to have the last words,
              as himself observeth;
              and that he hath
              been
              pleased
              to give way to others to shew
              their duty and affection in so just a cause; it
              was
              then no hard matter to persuade me to such further
              courses
              as might be thought on and pursued
              for the Churches
              peace. And I the rather was
              resolved
              to do somewhat in it, because the <hi>Smectymnuans</hi> in a
              manner had
              ingaged
            
            
            
            me in the undertaking,
            
            by giving
              me the Title of the <hi>Bishops
              Darling;</hi> a Title (which though
              given
              in scorn) had
              been
              ill bestowed,
              should I be wanting
              unto those of that Sacred Order, which
              were
              supposed
              to let me hold so principal a place in their
              affections.
          </p>
          <p>Doubly
            ingaged
            by duty and this provocation (which I could not take but for a
            challenge) I took
            their Book into my hand, in which I found the whole dispute,
            as it relates
            to the Episcopal
            Government reduced
            to these Propositions,

              Imparity of place (between Bishops
              and Presbyters)
              was
              not of divine right and Apostolical institution, but of
              humane invention and occasionally
              only, and that a Diabolical occasion also, and no more than

              claim, was
              both unknown to the Scripture and the Primitive
              times.</item>
            <item><hi>3.</hi> That antiently
              in some places
              of the World the Episcopal Government
              was
              never known
              for many years
              together, the people in those places
              being
              instructed
              in the faith without help of Bishops.</item>
          </list>
          <p>Hereupon they infer in the close of all, That
            Bishops
            or Episcopacy being
            at the best a meer
            humane Ordinance, may by the same Authority be
            abrogated,
            by which it was
            first established.</p>
          <p>This last I must confess delivered
            in the way of <hi>Quere,</hi> but so
            delivered
            as to carry a Position in it more pertinent to their aim and
            purpose than the other three.</p>
          <p>In prosecuting
            of which points,
            as they have shewed
            the greatest
            of their wit and cunning, to give the
            fairest
            colours
            to a rotten
            Cause; so have they brought
            no new Objections
            against the Episcopal Order and Jurisdiction, but what are
            either answered
            or prevented
            in the Learned
            works
            of B. <hi>Bilson,</hi> B. <hi>Downham,</hi> and other
            Worthies
            of this Church now in bliss with God. <hi>Nihil dictum, quod
            non dictum fuit prius;</hi> had
            been
            an
            Answer new enough for an
            old Objection.</p>
          <p>But seeing
            that these Men,
            though they could bring no new supply of
            Arguments
            is
            make good their Cause, would not rest
            satisfied
            with those old Answers
            which had
            been
            given
            in former times
            to their Predecessors:
            I was
            resolved
            to deal with them
            in another way
            than what hath
            formerly
            been
            travelled.
            Not in the way of Argumentation or a <hi>Polemical</hi>
            discourse, there being
            no likelihood of any end in such
            Disputations,
            as long as men
            had
            so much Sophistry as either to evade the Argument, or find
            some sleight to weaken and shift off the Answer. I rather
            chose
            (having
            found good success in that kind before) to manage the whole
            Controversie
            as it lay between us, in the way of
            an
            Historical Narration, as in point of fact, which I conceive to
            be the readiest
            means
            to convince gainsayers,
            and silence the dispute for the
            times
            to come. For if History be <hi>Testis temporum,</hi> the
            surest
            and most faithful witness of mens
            actions
            in the carriage of all publick
            businesses,
            as no doubt it is;
            it cannot but be also <hi>Magistra vitae</hi> (both which the
            Orator affirms
            of it) the best Instructress we can have in all
            Affairs
            of like nature as they come before us. The History of
            Episcopacy, collected
            from the Writings
            of the Antient
            Fathers,
            cannot but be of special use and efficacy in
            setting
            forth the Government of the Church in the
            purest
            times;
            especially
            when those Fathers
            are produced
            on no other occasion but either as
            writing
            on those Texts
            of Scripture, in which the Institution and Authority of
            Bishops
            is
            most clearly
            evidenced;
            or speaking
            of the condition of the Church in their several
            times,
            in the Administration and Government whereof, they
            had
            most of them
            some especial interess. Out of whose
            testimonies
            so digested
            and compared
            together, I doubt not but it will appear most
            evidently
            to an
            indifferent
            and impartial Reader; first, That our Lord and Saviour JESUS
            CHRIST laid
            the foundation of his Church in
            an
            imparity of Ministers,
            and that according
            unto his example the
            Apostles
            did
            the like, ordaining
            the three several Orders
            and Degrees
            of Bishops,
            Presbyters,
            and Deacons
            in the holy Ministry. Next, that the
            Government of
            Bishops
            being
            founded
            thus, was
            propagated
            over all the World with the faith it self, there
            being
            no Nation which received
            the one without the other. And finally
            that in matter of Authority and Jurisdiction, the
            Bishops
            of the primitive and purest
            Ages
            had
            full as much as ours
            of <hi>England</hi> in these latter
            times.
            And if I have done
            this, as I hope I have, it may more
            rationally
            be inferred,
            though perhaps
            not so safely
            as the times
            now are, that Bishops
            or Episcopacy being
            of Divine and Apostolical institution, no humane invention,
            cannot with piety be abrogated
            by a less Authority than that by which it
            was
            ordained
            at the first appointment.</p>
          
          
          <p>This is
            the sum, and this is
            the end of my design. In prosecution of the which, I
            had
            drawn
            down my story to the times
            of <hi>Constantine,</hi> by whose power and favour the Church
            began
            to settle in all parts
            of the Empire, where it had
            formerly
            been
            persecuted
            with all kind of Extremities,
            which either the wit of Tyranny could invent, or
            an
            unconquered patience suffer. And if it
            does
            appear by this Disquisition, that the Episcopal Government
            continued
            from the Apostles
            times
            till the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> not
            interrupted
            by the fury of those Persecutions
            which made
            such havock
            amongst men
            of that Sacred Order; there will be little question
            made
            of it for the time succeeding,
            in which both the Order and the
            Men
            were
            raised
            unto the highest
            pitch of Estimation. But finding
            one objection of a later
            date, not to be satisfied
            in and by the practice of those elder
            times,
            I think it not amiss to make answer to it here before we part.
            The matter to be prov'd, and in the proof whereof they do so
            much glory, is,
            <hi>That there is
            one Congregation at the least in the Christian World,</hi> in
            which the Government
            of Bishops
            hath
            met
            with Contradiction, contrary unto that which
            had
            been
            positively
            affirmed
            in the <hi>Humble Remonstrance.</hi> And this they prove from
            the Bishops
            own <hi>Darling HEYLYN,</hi>
            who told
            them
            in his Geography, <hi>pag. 55. That the
            people of</hi>
            Biscay <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>admit no
            Bishops
            to come amongst them;
            and that when</hi> Ferdinand <hi>the</hi>
            Catholick
            <hi>came
            in progress accompanied
            among others with the Bishop of</hi> Pampelone, <hi>the people
            rose up in Arms,
            drove back the Bishop, and gathering
            up all the dust which they thought he
            had
            trod
            on, flung
            it into the Sea.</hi> All this the <hi>Darling</hi> writes
            indeed, they say true in that. But can any rational Man
            infer from hence,
            that the People of <hi>Biscay</hi> do abominate the Episcopal
            Government; or that it is
            not there received
            without contradiction? They may conclude as
            strongly
            (I am
            sure more logically)
            that the Dean and Prebends
            of <hi>Westminster</hi> are enemies
            to Episcopal Government, or at the least receive it not
            without contradiction, because they suffer neither Archbishop
            nor Bishop to exercise any jurisdiction within that City and
            the Liberties
            of it; nor to hold any Convocation within that Church, but
            upon special leave obtained,
            and under a solemn protestation not to infringe thereby their
            antient
            priviledges.
            For the truth is,
            that the <hi>Biscains</hi> being
            a poor and indigent Nation, and
            finding
            the Episcopal Visitations
            very chargeable to them,
            procured
            a priviledge
            in times
            past, that their Bishops
            should not come in person to visit their
            Churches;
            for which consult the general History of <hi>Spain,</hi> fol.
            <hi>919.</hi> And being
            withal a rugged
            and untractable
            people, tenaciously
            addicted
            to their antient
            customs,
            and kept
            continually
            in mind of some wrongs
            and injuries,
            which had
            been
            offered
            by their Prelats
            in the times
            foregoing;
            they might be easily
            excited
            to that act of outrage against the Bishop of
            <hi>Pampelone,</hi> and yet without any the least
            contradiction receive there (as indeed they do) the
            Episcopal
            Government.</p>
          <p>But to proceed, I could not but perceive by this scornful
            attribute, under what prejudice I lay amongst those of that
            Party, and therefore that any thing of mine in Answer to
            them
            would not be lookt
            upon with equal and impartial eyes.
            The door of Truth is
            never so close barr'd, as when Prejudice and Prepossession
            have blockt
            up the entrance. In which respect
            having
            finished
            the discourse which I had
            in hand, I thought not fit to let it pass under my own name,
            but published
            it under that of <hi>Theophilus Churchman</hi> (not without
            many honest
            Precedents
            in that kind before.) A name which might both serve to conceal
            my Person and express my Relations,
            and whereunto I hoped
            to create no reproach or obloquy by my slack
            performances.</p>
          <p>
            But contrary to what I hoped,
              the Author of the Pamphlet called
              <hi>The Observator observed</hi>
              (finding
              perhaps who walked
              under that Disguise) must needs
              take him
              to task, setting
              upon him
              first with a petulant scorn, (after his usual way of
              throwing
              dirt on all he meets
              with) as not knowing
              by what name to call him,
              whether <hi>Goodman, Worshipful, Right Worshipful,
              Honourable, Right Honourable,</hi> or <hi>Right Reverend
              Churchman.</hi> Which said
              he chargeth
              it upon him,
              that there is
              nothing in his Book but what is
              stoln
              from Archbishop
              <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> Bishop
              <hi>Hall,</hi> and others, <hi>fol. 37.</hi> and
              reckoning
              up some others who have written
              in defence of Episcopacy, he acknowledges
              them
              all but <hi>Churchman</hi> to be good
              men
              and true, and consequently
              <hi>Churchman</hi> neither true nor good. Therefore that no
              man else may suffer by my imperfections,
              I have thought good to lay aside my former Vizor, to
              shew
              my self in my own likeness, and to cry out with
              him
              in <hi>Virgil, Me, me, adsum qui feci, in me convertite
              ferrum.</hi> Let him
              and all the Enemies
              of Episcopacy make their blows
              at me, and if I cannot stand my ground against all their
              Batteries,
              and justifie
              my self from the crime of falshood
              in all the particulars
              of that History, I shall with gladness follow their
              <hi>Triumphant Chariot</hi> like a
              conquered
              Captive: It will add something to the Pageant that
            
            
            
            the bold Champion of the Bishops
              (as he elsewhere scoffs
              it) hath
              his place therein.
          </p>
          <p>At this time passing
            over his reproachful taunts,
            I am
            to clear my self of the Felony which
            is
            charged
            upon me, for stealing
            all things
            in that Book from Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Bishop
            <hi>Bilson,</hi> Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> and others; this
            is
            <hi>Novum crimen  ante haec tempora inauditum,</hi> a
            Felony not heard
            of in the Common Law, to which the Gentleman
            pretends
            such a special knowledge. The citing
            of the Authors
            for every passage absolves
            me clearly
            from that crime. And I would fain know of
            him
            being
            so perfect an
            Historian, how a man writing
            the Affairs
            of the former times
            (which come not within the compass of
            <hi>Autopsie</hi>
            or ocular inspection, as we know who
            saith)
            can possibly
            attain to the knowledge of them,
            but by canvassing
            all sorts
            of Authors,
            which either lived
            in or near those times,
            or otherwise held
            Correspondence and Intelligence with
            them.
            It is
            not for all men
            (though it be for some) to challenge such a
            soveraign
            or <hi>praetorian</hi> power of
            coining
            as well the matter as the words
            of their Histories,
            that whatsoever they let fall, their
            negligences
            and ignorances,
            their mistakes
            and passions

            We poor men
            who pretend unto no such priviledge,
            and write of things
            done
            long agoe
            in the dark ages,
            and obscure twilights
            of the Church, must help our selves
            by the light of Letters,
            and thankfully
            make use of all hands
            which hold forth that Candle, without
            fear of holding
            up our own. If this be stealing,
            neither the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> nor <hi>Baronius,</hi> nor
            <hi>Torniellus, Salianus, Parker, Harpsfield, Fox,</hi> nor
            any of our late Compilers
            of Ecclesiastical
            or Civil History can be acquitted
            from the Crime. Let us all be discharged
            or condemned
            together; <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> all or none,
            there's no question of it.</p>
          <p>But I have gone
            too far on this Gentlemans
            Errant. And therefore for the credit of those
            Witnesses
            which I have produc'd, what is
            desired
            of the Reader in relation to them,
            with other things
            preparatory to the following
            History, I must refer the Reader to the General Preface; that
            being
            informed
            in all particulars
            which concern the Evidence, he may the better be
            enabled
            to give up his Verdict. I close up this Address with these

                OF all the
                  <hi>Types</hi>
                  in holy Scripture,
                
                I find not any that did
                  so fully
                  represent the nature of our Saviours
                  Kingdom, as those of <hi>David,
                  Moses,</hi>
                  and <hi>Melchizedech.
                  David</hi> a Shepherd,
                
                and a King, <hi>Moses</hi>
                  a Legislator, and a Prince; <hi>Melchisedech</hi> both
                  King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and a <hi>Priest</hi> also
                  <hi>of the living
                  God,</hi> as that Text hath
                  stiled
                  him.
                  Each of these was
                  a type of our Saviour Christ, according
                  to his Regal Office; he being
                  like <hi>Melchisedech,</hi>
                
                a <hi>King of Peace and Righteousness;</hi>
                  leading
                  his people, as did
                  <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  out of the darkness and Idolatries
                  of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi>
                
                and conquering
                  like <hi>David</hi> all those Enemies
                  which before held
                  them
                  in subjection. This Office, as it
                  is
                  supreme, so it is
                  perpetual. That God who tells
                  us in the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                  that he had
                  <hi>set his King on Zion, on his holy mountain:</hi>
                
                hath
                  also told
                  us by his Angel, that he should <hi>reign over the House
                  of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there should be no
                  end.</hi> But if we look upon him
                  in his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Pastoral</hi>
                  Offices:
                  if we behold him
                  as a <hi>Lawgiver</hi> to his Church and people: we find
                  him
                  not fore-signified
                  in any one of these, but in all together.
                
                A <hi>Priest he was
                
                
                
                after the order of Melchisedech;</hi>
                
                <hi>faithful to him
                  that did
                  appoint him,
                  as also Moses
                  was
                  faithful in all his house;</hi>
                  ordering,
                  and disposing
                  of the same, according
                  to his will and pleasure. And as for the discharge of
                  his Pastoral or Prophetical Office, God
                  likeneth
                  him
                  to <hi>David,</hi>
                
                by his holy Prophet saying,
                  <hi>I will set up one Shepheard
                  over them,
                  and he shall feed them,
                  even my servant</hi> David, <hi>he shall feed
                  them,
                  and he shall be their shepheard.</hi>
                  Which Offices,
                  although subordinate to the <hi>Regal</hi> power, are
                  perpetual
                  also. He was
                  not made
                  a <hi>Priest</hi> for a time or season, but for ever.
                  <hi>Tu es Sacerdos
                  in aeternum:</hi>
                
                Thou art a Priest for ever, said
                  the Lord unto him.
                  A <hi>Priest,</hi> who as he <hi>once
                  appeared
                  to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself;</hi>
                
                so by that <hi>one offering
                  hath
                  he perfected
                  for ever all them
                  that are sanctified;</hi>
                
                <hi>and sitting
                  down at the right hand of God,</hi>
                
                <hi>he ever liveth,
                  and maketh
                  intercession for them.</hi>
                  Of the same perpetuity also are those other
                  Offices
                  of Christ our Saviour, before remembred.
                  He had
                  not been
                  <hi>sidelis sicut Moses,</hi>
                
                faithful as <hi>Moses</hi>
                  was
                  in all his house: <hi>i. e.</hi> as <hi>Estius</hi> well
                  expounds
                  it, <hi>in administratione
                  populi sibi credita,</hi> in the
                  well-ordering
                  of the charge committed
                  to him,
                  had
                  he not constituted
                  a set Form of Government, and given
                  the same unto his Church, as a Rule for ever. Nor
                  had
                  he faithfully
                  discharged
                  the part of <hi>David,</hi> had
                  he looked
                  only to his <hi>flock,</hi> whiles
                  himself was
                  present; and took
                  no care for the continual feeding
                  of the same, after he was
                  returned
                  to his heavenly glories.
                  And therefore,
                
                <hi>when he ascended
                  up on high he gave
                  gifts
                  to men,</hi>
                  and <hi>gave
                  some Apostles,</hi>

                  and Teachers;
                  for the perfecting
                  of the Saints,
                  for the work of the Ministry, for the
                  edifying
                  of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of
                  faith, and of the knowledg
                  of the son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure

                He <hi>gave</hi>
                  them
                  then indeed,
                
                after his <hi>Ascension,</hi> when he
                  <hi>ascended
                  up on high,</hi> because
                  he then did
                  furnish them
                  with those gifts
                  and graces,
                  wherewith they were
                  endued
                  by the Holy Ghost, and thereby fitted
                  for the execution of the trust committed
                  to them
                  by their Lord. For otherwise many of
                  them
                  had
                  been
                  given
                  already; not only in the way of choice, and designation,
                  but of commission and employment.
                  <hi>Ite,</hi>

                  before. It was
                  not long after our Saviours
                  baptism by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that some
                  Disciples
                  came
                  unto him.
                  That testimony
                  which came
                  down from God the Father, when the
                  <hi>Heavens
                  were
                  opened,
                  and the Spirit of God descended
                  on him
                  like a Dove,</hi>
                
                was
                  of it self sufficient to procure many
                  followers.
                  The evidence which was
                  given
                  by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
                  added
                  nought to this. And yet that evidence
                  prevailed
                  so far,
                
                that two of his Disciples,
                  <hi>when they heard
                  him
                  speak,</hi> forsook
                  their old Master, and <hi>went
                  after Jesus.</hi> Nor did
                  it satisfie
                  them,
                  that they had
                  <hi>found the Christ,</hi> and had
                  talked
                  with him,
                  but they impart the same unto others also. Thus
                  <hi>Andrew</hi> brings
                  in his own Brother <hi>Simon; Philip</hi>
                  invites
                  his friend <hi>Nathancel.</hi>
                
                One tells
                  another the glad tidings,
                  that they <hi>had
                  found him
                  of whom</hi>
                  Moses
                  <hi>in the Law, and all the Prophets
                  did
                  write:</hi> and all of them
                  desire to be his <hi>Disciples.</hi>
                
                Afterward as his fame increased,
                  so his followers
                  multiplyed;
                  and every Miracle that he wrought
                  to confirm his Doctrine, did
                  add unto the number of his <hi>Proselytes.</hi>
                  So great his fame was,
                  and so great the conflux of all
                  sorts
                  of people, that <hi>Johns</hi>
                  Disciples
                  presently
                  complained,
                  I know not whether with more truth or envy,
                
                <hi>Omnes ad eum veniunt,</hi> that all
                  men
                  came
                  unto him,
                  both to hear his preaching,
                  and receive his baptism. And certainly
                  it was
                  no wonder that it should be so; that all
                  men
                  should resort to him,
                  who was
                  the <hi>way;</hi> or seek for him,
                  who was
                  the <hi>truth;</hi>
                
                or follow after him,
                  who was
                  the <hi>life. Lord</hi> (saith
                  Saint <hi>Peter, to whom
                  shall we go? thou hast
                  the words
                  of life eternal.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of his followers
                  being
                  thus increased,
                
                he sends
                  them
                  not immediately
                  to preach his <hi>Gospel.</hi> Two
                  years
                  he trained
                  them
                  up in the School of Piety, where he himself
                  was
                  both the Teacher and the Lesson, before he
                  ventured
                  them
                  abroad upon that employment; And when he
                  ventured
                  them
                  abroad, he neither sent
                  them
                  all together,
                
                nor with like authority. <hi>Twelve</hi> he
                  selected
                  from the rest, whom
                  he named
                  <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                
                And he <hi>ordained
                  them</hi>
                  saith
                  Saint <hi>Mark, that they should be with
                  him,
                  and that he might send them
                  forth to preach:</hi> first to be <hi>with
                  him,</hi>
                  as the constant witnesses
                  of his words
                  and works,
                  and afterwards
                  to <hi>preach</hi> and publish what they
                  saw
                  and heard.
                
                In which regard, <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  calls
                  them
                  not unfitly,
                  <hi>Legatos  latere,</hi>
                  sent
                  from Christ to teach the Nations.
                  <hi>Ex quibus</hi> (out of his Disciples)
                  <hi>duodecem praecipuos lateri suo adlegerat, destinatos
                  nationibus Magistros:</hi> as his own
                  words
                  are. The same <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  gives
                  a reason, why Christ made
                  choice of twelve Apostles,
                  neither
                  more nor less:
                
                <hi>viz.</hi> because there were
                  twelve Fountains
                  in <hi>Elim;</hi> twelve gems
                
                
                or pretious
                  Stones
                  in the Brest-plate
                  of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and twelve stones
                  taken
                  out of <hi>Jordan</hi> by the hand of <hi>Joshua,</hi>
                  and by him
                  put into the Ark of the Testament. And then he
                  adds,
                  <hi>totidem enim Apostoli praetendebantur,</hi> that the
                  like number of Apostles
                  was
                  prefigured.
                  Other conceits
                  there are of the Ancient Fathers
                  about this number: <hi>Bede,</hi> and <hi>Sedulius,</hi>
                  resemble them
                  to the twelve signs
                  of the <hi>Zodiack:
                  Justin Martyr</hi> to the twelve
                  Bells
                  in the high Priests
                  garment: <hi>Tertullian</hi> before
                  named,
                
                to the twelve Oxen
                  that did
                  uphold the molten
                  Sea in the Temple of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Others have other
                  fancies
                  to the same effect; but whether Christ
                  related
                  unto any of them
                  in this designation,
                  as it is
                  no where to be found, so is
                  it not material to the present purpose.
                  More near unto the point in my opinion,
                  is
                  that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who thinks
                  our Saviour in the choice of his <hi>twelve
                  Disciples</hi>
                  related
                  to the <hi>twelve Patriarchs</hi>
                  of the Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel:</hi> to shew
                  that as the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
                  were
                  the root and seminary of the Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel,</hi> so the Apostles
                  were
                  to be the Parents,
                  or if you will,
                
                the Patriarchs
                  of the Church of Christ, <hi>Non ergo frustra Dominus
                  duodecim veluti Patriarchas constituens,
                  Ecclesiae renunciationem testatus est.</hi> Which guess
                  of his, though it come nearer
                  to the matter than the other did;
                  yet it falls
                  short also of the true intention of our Lord and
                  Saviour. For <hi>Christ,</hi> who
                  was
                  best able to assign the reason of his mind herein,
                  hath
                  told
                  us, that he fitted
                  his <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  according
                  to the number of the Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel;</hi> that his <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  in due time might become their <hi>Judges.</hi>
                  For so himself declares
                  it in his holy Gospel; <hi>Verily</hi>
                  (saith
                  he) <hi>I say unto you,</hi>
                
                <hi>that ye which have followed
                  me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in
                  the throne of his glory, ye shall also sit upon twelve
                  thrones,
                  judging
                  the twelve tribes
                  of Israel,</hi>
                
                i. e. as <hi>Hierom</hi> doth expound it, <hi>Quia
                  credentibus vobis, illi credere noluerunt;</hi> by
                  reason of their obstinacy
                  and unbelief, not giving
                  credit to that Gospel the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  preached.
                  <hi>Twelve</hi> then our Saviour
                  pleased
                  to chuse,
                  whom
                  he named
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  and they themselves conceived
                  this number not to want its
                  weight: and therefore made
                  it their first care to fill up their number, and
                  surrogate some other in the place of <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  Saint <hi>Peter</hi> very well declared
                  the necessity of it, when he came
                  in with his <hi>Oportet;</hi>
                
                <hi>Oportet ergo ex his viris,</hi> c.
                  <hi>Wherefore of these men
                  that have companied
                  with us all the time, that the Lord Jesus
                  went
                  in and out amongst us, must one be
                  ordained
                  to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</hi> So
                  excellently
                  true is
                  that of <hi>Austin, Adeo numerus ille sacratus est,</hi>
                
                <hi>ut in locum unius qui exciderat, non posset nisi
                  alter nominari.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the name, <hi>quos  Apostolos
                  nominavit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
                  informs
                  us:
                
                <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks
                  it was
                  not of our Saviours
                  own divising,
                
                but by him
                  borrowed
                  of the high Priests
                  of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, who
                  had
                  a special kind of Ministers,
                  whom
                  they called
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  imployed
                  by them
                  for the instruction of the <hi>Priests,</hi>
                
                the visiting
                  of the several <hi>Synagogues,</hi>
                  the rectifying
                  of ill manners,
                  and the reforming
                  of those publick
                  <hi>Ministers,</hi>
                  who did
                  not live according
                  to the prescript of the Law. Whether that it
                  were
                  so or not, or that the Cardinal be not
                  mistaken
                  in the meaning
                  of the Author whom
                  he citeth;
                  I will not meddle for the present: though I conceive by
                  looking
                  on the place in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that the
                  succeeding
                  <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
                  of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation,
                  did
                  rather take this name from Christs
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  than he from theirs. But for the word as now we use it,
                  it is
                  meerly
                  <hi>Greek,</hi> signifying
                  in its
                  natural and original
                  sense a Messenger, a Legate, an
                  Embassadour;
                  from whom,
                  to whomsoever sent:
                  after appropriated
                  and applyed
                  by the <hi>Evangelists</hi>
                  to signifie
                  those <hi>twelve,</hi> whom
                  our Saviour chose,
                  and called
                  his <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  as by way of excellence: yet so that many of those
                  men
                  who saw
                  our Saviour in the flesh, and did
                  preach the <hi>Gospel,</hi> are
                  sometimes
                  honoured
                  with that name. <hi>Quod autem
                  exceptis duodecim quidam vocantur
                  Apostoli, illud in causa est, omnes qui Dominum
                  viderunt,  eum postea praedicarunt,
                  fuisse Apostolos nominatos:</hi> as Saint
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> notes
                  it. By which we see, that those two
                  things
                  did
                  principally
                  concur unto the making
                  of an
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> viz. to have been
                  conversant with our Saviour Christ, and to preach his
                  Word: which being
                  most exactly
                  verified
                  in those <hi>twelve Disciples,</hi>
                  whom
                  he selected
                  for that purpose; it was
                  most fit that they should chiefly
                  have the honour of so high a Title. But these, although
                  they were
                  two special marks
                  of an
                  Apostle; yet they were
                  not all. Others had
                  seen
                  our Saviour in the flesh, and preached
                  his Gospe, which notwithstanding
                  never durst
                  assume that Title: <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
                  affirms
                  it of himself,
                
                that he had
                  seen
                  the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> doth yet disclaim the power and
                  priviledg
                  of an
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> ,
                  saith
                  he in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  So that besides
                  their <hi>seeing</hi>
                  of our Saviour in the flesh, and
                  <hi>preaching</hi>
                  of those things
                  which themselves had
                  seen;
                  the Twelve had
                  a preheminence
                  above the rest of the Disciples,
                
                
                
                in those three particulars:
                  first, in their nearness of access unto
                  him
                  when he was
                  alive: Secondly,
                  in the latitude of their commission, when he
                  was
                  to leave them:
                  And thirdly,
                  in the height of their authority after his departure.
              </p>
              <p>
                For first,
                
                the <hi>twelve Apostles,</hi>
                  and no others were
                  the continual, constant, and domestical
                  Auditors
                  of all his Sermons;
                  the diligent beholders
                  and observers
                  of all his <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                  With them
                  did
                  he discourse familiarly,
                  propounding
                  questions,
                  answering
                  their demands,
                  and satifying
                  all their scruples.
                  The <hi>Twelve,</hi> and none but they,
                  were
                  present with him,
                  when he did
                  institute his <hi>holy Supper:</hi> and they alone
                  participated
                  of those Prayers
                  and Promises
                  which he made
                  to them
                  from himself, or for them
                  to his heavenly Father. Many there
                  were
                  of his retinue, of his Court not few: the Twelve
                  were
                  only of his Council; and of those too, some more
                  especially
                  admitted
                  to his privacies,
                  and of his Cabinet-council; (as it
                  were)
                  than others; whereof see <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.1.
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.51. And on this
                  ground doth <hi>Clemens</hi> tell us,
                
                that Christ imparted
                  many things
                  unto these three after his Ascension,
                  which they communicated
                  , unto the rest of the
                  Apostles:
                  the rest of the Apostles
                  to the 70. As they were
                  nearer
                  in access, so were
                  they furnished
                  with a more liberal Commission,
                
                when he was
                  to leave them.
                  <hi>Ite in universum
                  mundum.</hi> He said
                  unto them,
                  <hi>Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
                  every creature.</hi> No such commission
                  granted
                  to any others, who had
                  their several precincts
                  and bounds,
                  a limited
                  Commission when it was
                  at best. To the <hi>Eleven</hi> (for unto
                  them
                  alone did
                  he give that charge) the whole World
                  went
                  but for a <hi>Diocess.</hi>
                
                For this cause <hi>Chrysostom</hi> doth honour
                  them
                  with the stile of <hi>Princes,</hi>
                  and Princes
                  of a great command over all the Universe.
                  , c. The
                  Apostles
                  were
                  ordained
                  Princes
                  by the hand of God: Princes
                  which have not only under them
                  some Towns,
                  and Nations,
                  , but such unto whose care the whole
                  World was
                  trusted.
                  So far that Father. And if we doubt that their authority
                  fell short in any thing of their Commission: the same
                  good Father in the same place, will inform us otherwise.
                  For making
                  a comparison between Spiritual and Civil
                  Dignities,
                
                he calleth
                  the Office of an
                  Apostle, , a spiritual
                  <hi>Consulship,</hi>
                  , the most spiritual of all
                  Powers
                  or Governments;
                  and finally,
                  : the head, the root, nay the
                  foundation of all spiritual Dignities
                  of what sort soever. Doubtless the Father
                  had
                  good reason for so high an
                  Eulogie.
                  When Christ affirmed,
                  <hi>Sicut misit me Pater,</hi>
                
                that <hi>as his Father sent
                  him,
                  so sent
                  he them:</hi>
                  He said
                  enough to intimate
                  that supreme authority which he
                  had
                  given
                  them
                  in the Church, whether it were
                  in <hi>preaching</hi>
                  of the Gospel, in <hi>founding</hi>
                  Churches,
                  <hi>constituting,</hi>
                  and <hi>ordaining
                  Pastors,</hi>
                  or whatsoever else was
                  necessary for the advancement of his Kingdom. For by
                  these words,
                  as <hi>Cyril</hi> hath
                  right well observed,
                  , he did
                  ordain them
                  for to be Guides
                  and Teachers
                  unto all the World,
                
                and the dispensers
                  of his holy Mysteries,
                  commanding
                  them
                  not only to enlighten the land of
                  <hi>Jewrie,</hi>
                  but all the people of the Universe: as also
                  giving
                  them
                  to understand that it was
                  their duty, , to call the
                  sinners
                  to repentance, to heal all those that
                  were
                  afflicted,
                  either in body or in soul, in the
                  dispensing
                  of Gods
                  blessings;
                  not to follow their own will, but his that
                  sent
                  them:
                  and in a word, as much as in them
                  was,
                  , to save the World by
                  wholsom
                  dictrines, for to that purpose
                  was
                  he sent
                  by his Heavenly Father. And so we are to understand
                  Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                  when he tells
                  us this,
                
                that Christ invested
                  his Apostles
                  with the like authority as he received
                  from his Father. <hi>Calvin</hi>
                  affirms
                  as much or more upon those words
                  of our Redeemer. <hi>Quare non abs re Christus cum
                  Apostolis suis communicat,
                  quam  Patre autoritatem acoeperat,</hi> c.
                  But this authority of theirs will be
                  seen
                  more clearly,
                  when we behold it in the practice, and execution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Five things
                  then of necessity were
                  to concur in the making
                  or constituting
                  of an
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi>
                
                truly
                  and properly
                  so called:
                  first an
                  immediate Call from Christ himself:
                  secondly,
                  an
                  <hi>Autopsie,</hi>
                  or Eye-witnessing
                  of those things
                  which they were
                  afterwards
                  to preach or publish of him:
                  thirdly,
                  their nearness of access: fourthly,
                  the latitude of their Commission:
                  fifthly,
                  and finally,
                  the eminence of their authority: Of these the first
                  were
                  common with them
                  unto the rest of the Disciples;
                  save that the calling
                  of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  to that charge, and function doth seem to be more
                  solemn, and immediate.
                  But in the rest, which are indeed the special or
                  specifical differences,
                  they had
                
                
                no co-partners.
                  This made
                  them
                  every way <hi>superiour</hi>
                  unto the rest of the Disciples,
                  although
                  all <hi>equal</hi> in themselves. Though in the
                  calling
                  of those blessed
                  Spirits
                  to that great imployment,
                  there was
                  a <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>posterius;</hi> yet in regard
                  of power and authority,
                  there was
                  neither <hi>Summum,</hi> nor <hi>Subalternum:</hi> And
                  howsoever <hi>Peter</hi> be first
                  named
                  in that sacred Catalogue; yet this
                  entitleth
                  him
                  to no more authority, above the rest of the
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  than <hi>Stephen</hi> might challenge in that regard
                  above the residue of the <hi>Seven.</hi> Saint
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> did
                  resolve this cause many hundreds
                  since; assigning
                  unto all the twelve a parity of power and honour.
                
                <hi>Hoc erant utique  caeteri Apostoli quod
                  fuit</hi> Petrus, <hi>pari consortio praediti, 
                  honoris  potestatis; sed exordium ab unitate
                  proficiscitur.</hi> Where clearly
                  there is
                  nothing given
                  to <hi>Peter,</hi> but a <hi>priority</hi> of Order; a
                  <hi>primacy</hi> if you will, but no <hi>supremacy.</hi>
                  Neither doth <hi>Barlaam</hi> give
                  him
                  more, though he inscribe his book, <hi>de Papae
                  Principatu.</hi> , c. The
                  Apostles,
                  all of them
                  saith
                  he,
                
                in matter which concerned
                  the Church, were
                  of equal honour. If <hi>Peter</hi>
                  had
                  preheminence
                  in any thing, it was
                  that in their sacred meetings
                  he first brake
                  the business,  and peradventure also
                  had
                  the upper place in the assemblies
                  of that <hi>goodly fellowship.</hi> But what need
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or <hi>Barlaam</hi> come in for
                  evidence, when as we find this parity so
                  clearly
                  evidenced
                  in holy Scripture? In the immediateness of their
                  Calling,
                  and their access unto our Lord and Saviour, they
                  were
                  all alike. He that called
                  <hi>Peter</hi> from his Nets,
                  called
                  also <hi>Matthew</hi> from the receit
                  of custom. If only <hi>Peter,</hi> and the
                  sons
                  of <hi>Zebedee</hi> were
                  taken
                  with him
                  to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi>
                
                there to behold the glory of his
                  <hi>Transfiguration;</hi>
                
                or chosen
                  from amongst the rest to attend his person when he
                  went
                  out into the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane:</hi> this
                  makes
                  as much for the <hi>supremacy</hi> of the
                  sons
                  of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> as the son of <hi>Jona.</hi> Their
                  mission, and commission were
                  alike to all. He that said
                  <hi>Ite  docete,</hi> Go into all the world and
                  <hi>preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi>
                  spake
                  it indefinitely
                  to every one; not unto <hi>Peter</hi> only, as the
                  supreme <hi>Pastor;</hi> from whom
                  the rest were
                  to receive a delegated
                  and confined
                  authority. Neither had
                  he so often been
                  molested
                  with that needless question, <hi>which of
                  them
                  should be greatest</hi>
                  in their Masters
                  <hi>Kingdom:</hi> had
                  he before determined
                  of it, and setled
                  the supremacy in Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  person. And as for those prerogatives,
                  of <hi>Tibi dabo claves, Pasce oves meas:</hi> which
                  being
                  spoken
                  unto <hi>Peter,</hi> may seem peculiarly
                  to belong to him:
                  the Fathers
                  say, that nothing did
                  hereby accrew
                  to <hi>Peter,</hi> but what was
                  common to the rest. <hi>Ecclesiae enim claves regni
                  coelorum datae sunt. Et cum ei dicitur, ad omnes
                  dicitur, Amas me?</hi>
                
                <hi>Pasce oves meas:</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  states
                  it. But what need more be said
                  to affirm this point, than that of our most
                  blessed
                  Saviour, when he encouraged
                  them
                  to perseverance with this heavenly Cordial, that they
                  should <hi>sit upon twelve Thrones,</hi>
                
                <hi>judging
                  the twelve Tribes
                  of Israel?</hi> In which most gracious
                  words
                  of his, as the sitting
                  of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  shews
                  authority;
                  their sitting
                  upon Thrones,
                  an
                  eminence of power; their sitting
                  to judg,
                  a power and exercise of jurisdiction; and their
                  sitting
                  thus to judg
                  the twelve Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel,</hi> the universality and extent of their
                  jurisdiction:
                
                so doth their sitting
                  on twelve Thrones,
                  <hi>singuli in sua sede,</hi>
                  as <hi>Jansenius</hi> hath
                  it, intimate an
                  equality of jurisdiction,
                  a parity in point of power.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to proceed, Our Saviour finding
                  that the harvest was
                  great,
                
                and the labourers
                  as yet but few, and that his hour
                  was
                  now at hand, <hi>appointed
                  other seventy also,</hi>
                
                <hi>and sent
                  them
                  two, and two before his face, into every City and place,
                  whither he himself would come.</hi>
                
                To them
                  he gave
                  authority to proclaim, and publish to the people,
                
                that <hi>the Kingdom of God was
                  come nigh unto them:</hi>
                  giving
                  them
                  also power to <hi>heal the sick,</hi> and to <hi>cast
                  out Devils,</hi>
                  as he had
                  formerly
                  to his <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  So that there is
                  no question to be made,
                  but that they were
                  intrusted
                  with a part of this sacred <hi>Ministery,</hi>
                  but whether in an
                  equal rank we shall see anon. In the mean time if any
                  question should be asked
                  who these Seventy were
                  and by what names
                  called;
                  we answer, <hi>nondum constat,</hi> that we
                  cannot tell.
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> as great a searcher into the
                  monuments
                  of Antiquity,
                
                as the Church ever bred,
                  professeth
                  plainly,
                  , that he could
                  never meet
                  with any list or catalogue of them.
                  Some he had
                  taken
                  up on hear-say,
                
                as <hi>Barnabas, Sosthenes, Cephas, Matthias,</hi> after
                  chose
                  into the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Thaddeus.
                  Papias</hi> mentioneth
                  <hi>Aristion,</hi> as another of that number also. And
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> adds
                  to these, <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the residue of the
                  Seven, <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> two of the
                  <hi>Evangelists,
                  Justus,</hi> who stood
                  in competition with <hi>Matthias,</hi> together with
                  <hi>Apelles, Rufas,</hi> and <hi>Niger,</hi> whose
                  names
                  occur in holy Scripture. These are the most that there
                  is
                  any ground for, in antiquity. As for the Catalogue of
                  their names
                  and actions
                  fathered
                  on <hi>Dorotheus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyre:</hi> there
                  is
                  not any thing more false and fabulous: that
                  <hi>Rhapsodist</hi> thrusting
                
                
                
                into that Catalogue, many who were
                  converted
                  by the Apostles,
                  after Christs Ascension.
                  Insomuch as <hi>Estius</hi> worthily
                  complaineth,
                
                <hi>eos fere omnes qui  Paulo in hoc capite
                  nominantur, aut salutantes, aut salutandi,</hi> that all
                  the men
                  whose names
                  occur in the 16. Chapter to the
                  <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  are by him
                  thrust into the Catalogue of the Seventy
                  Disciples:
                  not to say any thing of those many other
                  absurdities,
                  which he hath
                  noted
                  in that Bedrol.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the number of <hi>Seventy,</hi>
                
                why our Redeemer pitched
                  on that, there is
                  not much dispute amongst the learned.
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who had
                  fitted
                  (as before we saw)
                  the number
                  of the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                
                to the twelve fountains
                  in <hi>Elim;</hi> doth also proportion the number of
                  these <hi>Disciples,
                  ad arbusta Palmarum,</hi> unto the number of the
                  <hi>Palm-trees,</hi>
                  that grew
                  thereby. But this being
                  only in the way of <hi>Allegory,</hi> we shall pass it
                  over: only reserving
                  the Application made
                  by <hi>Hierom</hi> for a little
                  longer.
                  That which cometh
                  nearest
                  the matter, and is
                  agreed
                  upon almost by all sorts
                  of Writers,
                  is
                  that our Saviour in this choice,
                  related
                  to the <hi>Seventy Elders</hi>
                  interessed
                  in the government of the Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel:</hi>
                
                mention of whom
                  is
                  made,
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.11.
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> amongst the rest
                  gives
                  this reason of it, <hi>In numero septuaginta videtur eum
                  ordinem secutus esse, cui jam olim assueverat
                  populus:</hi> and adds
                  withal another note, which may well serve to reconcile
                  the difference about this number, which
                  is
                  between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi>
                  Copies.
                  For the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies
                  have it generally,
                  , that he <hi>appointed
                  other seventy also,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi>
                  reads
                  it. The <hi>Latin</hi> no less generally:
                  <hi>Designavit
                   alios septuaginta duos,</hi> that he
                  sent
                  out other seventy two: which reading
                  doth occur in <hi>Hierom,</hi>
                
                <hi>Austin,</hi> and some others. I know indeed,
                  <hi>Beza</hi> doth put an
                  handsom
                  slur on the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies,
                  and thinks
                  that some poor ignorant Scribes
                  (<hi>Librarii
                  indocti,</hi> as he calls
                  them)
                  abbreviating
                  the word <hi>discipulos</hi> into <hi>dlos:</hi> others
                  as ignorant as they out of <hi>dlos</hi> read
                  <hi>duos,</hi> and so found seventy two
                  Disciples
                  instead of seventy. But surely
                  those renowned
                  Fathers
                  <hi>Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  were
                  no such <hi>Babies:</hi>
                  not to say any thing of <hi>Beda,</hi> and the rest that
                  followed.
                  And therefore since it is
                  agreed
                  on, that these Disciples
                  were
                  proportioned
                  to the number of the <hi>Elders</hi>
                  of the Tribes
                  of <hi>Israel:</hi> we must first find what
                  was
                  the number of those Elders,
                  before we can agree upon the other. Now for the number
                  of those <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  the Scripture saith
                  expresly,
                  they were
                  seventy two, as may appear by comparing
                  the 25. verse of the 11. of <hi>Numbers,</hi>
                  with the 26. in which we find that there
                  were
                  <hi>seventy Elders
                  gathered
                  about the Tabernacle,</hi> besides
                  <hi>Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> in the Camp. For
                  making
                  up this number, as afterwards
                  in the translation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> there
                  were
                  six chosen
                  out of every Tribe, ,
                
                as <hi>Josephus</hi> hath
                  it, which cometh
                  to seventy two in all. But both the <hi>seventy two</hi>
                  Elders,
                  are generally
                  called
                  the <hi>Seventy;</hi> as the Translators
                  of the <hi>Bible</hi> are called
                  the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> both of
                  them
                  <hi>ad rotundationem numeri:</hi> even as the
                  Magistrates
                  in <hi>Rome</hi> were
                  called
                  <hi>Centumviri,</hi> though being
                  three for every Tribe, they came
                  unto an
                  hundred and five in all.
                
                And this is
                  that which <hi>Calvin</hi> hath
                  observed
                  in the present business: <hi>viz.</hi> that the
                  Consistory of the <hi>Jewish Judges,</hi>
                  to which the number of the Disciples
                  is
                  by him
                  proportioned,
                  consisted
                  of no less than 72, though for the most part, <hi>ut
                  fieri solet in talibus numeris,</hi> they are
                  called
                  the <hi>Seventy.</hi> So then to reconcile the
                  <hi>Latin</hi> with the <hi>Greek</hi> Original, there
                  were
                  in all 72 <hi>Disciples,</hi>
                  according
                  to the truth of the calculation: and yet but seventy in
                  account, according
                  to the estimation
                  which was
                  then in use. And therefore possibly
                  the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the better to comply
                  with both computations;
                  though it have seventy in the new
                  <hi>Translations,</hi>
                  yet still retains
                  the number of seventy two, in the Gospel
                  appointed
                  for Saint <hi>Lukes</hi>
                  day in the book of <hi>Common-prayer</hi>
                  confirmed
                  by Parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
                This being
                  the number of the <hi>Disciples,</hi>
                
                it will then fall out, that as there
                  were
                  six <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  for every Tribes
                  so here will be six Presbyters
                  or <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  for every one of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  For those which have compared
                  the Church of Christ which was
                  first planted
                  by the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  with that which was
                  first founded
                  by the Lord himself: resemble the
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  in the Church to the twelve <hi>Apostles;</hi>
                  the Presbyters,
                  or <hi>Priests,</hi>
                  unto the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Which parallel how well it
                  holdeth,
                  and whether it will hold, or not, we shall see
                  hereafter. Mean while it cannot be
                  denied,
                  but that the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  were
                  superiour
                  to these <hi>Seventy,</hi> both in place and power. The
                  Fathers
                  have so generally
                  affirmed
                  the same, that he must needs
                  run cross unto all antiquity that
                  makes
                  question of it. The Council of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi>
                  which was
                  convened
                  some years
                  before that of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                
                declareth
                  that the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> which
                  were
                  but Presbyters
                  in fact, (though in Title <hi>Bishops</hi>)
                  ,
                
                were
                  instituted
                  according
                  to the pattern
                  of the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his
                  Tractate <hi>ad Fabiolam,</hi> speaking
                  of the twelve
                
                
                fountains
                  of <hi>Elim,</hi> and the seventy
                  Psalms
                  that grew
                  thereby, doth resolve it thus, <hi>Nec dubium quin de
                  duodeeim Apostolis sermo sit,</hi> c. <hi>It
                  is
                  not to be doubted,
                  but that the Scripture speaketh
                  here of the twelve Apostles,
                  the waters
                  issuing
                  from whose fountains
                  have moistned
                  the barren driness
                  of the whole World; and that the seventy
                  Psalms
                  that grew
                  thereby, are the Teachers
                  of the second rank or order:</hi> Luca testante duodecim
                  fuisse Apostolos,
                   septuaginta Discipulos minoris gradus:
                  <hi>Saint</hi> Luke <hi>affirming
                  that there were
                  twelve</hi> Apostles,
                  <hi>and seventy</hi> Disciples
                  <hi>of a lower order, whom
                  the Lord sent
                  two and two before him.</hi>
                  In this conceit, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                  led
                  the way before him,
                  likening
                  unto those Psalms
                  the <hi>Seventy, qui secundo ab Apostolis gradu,</hi>
                  who in a second rank from the Apostles,
                  were
                  by the Lord sent
                  forth for the salvation of mankind.
                  <hi>Serm.</hi>
                  24. <hi>Damasus</hi> their co-temporary doth affirm as
                  much, <hi>viz. non amplius quam duos ordines,</hi>
                
                that there were
                  but two Orders
                  amongst the Disciples
                  of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the twelve
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  and the <hi>Seventy. Theophylact</hi>
                  concurrs
                  with <hi>Hierom</hi> in his conceit about the twelve
                  Fountains,
                  and the seventy Palm-trees:
                  and then concludes,
                
                that <hi>howsoever they were
                  chosen
                  by Christ,</hi> , <hi>yet
                  were
                  they inferiour
                  to the twelve, and afterwards
                  their followers
                  and Scholars.</hi>
                  Add hereunto the testimony and consent of
                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> who giving
                  the preheminence
                  unto the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                
                as the chief builders
                  of the Church; adds
                  in the next place the <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
                  such as were
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,  fortassis etiam
                  septuaginta Discipuli, quos secundo ab Apostolis loco
                  Dominus designavit:</hi> and peradventure also the
                  <hi>seventy Disciples,</hi>
                  whom
                  Christ appointed
                  in the second place after his <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  Besides,
                  S. <hi>Hierom</hi> giveth
                  it for a Maxim, <hi>Qui provehitur,</hi>
                
                <hi>de minore ad majus provehitur,</hi> that he which
                  is
                  promoted,
                  is
                  promoted
                  from a lower rank unto an
                  higher.
                  <hi>Matthias</hi> therefore, having
                  been
                  formerly
                  of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and afterwards
                  advanced
                  into the rank and number of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> in the
                  place of <hi>Judas:</hi> it must
                  needs
                  follow that the <hi>twelve Apostles</hi>
                  shined
                  in an
                  higher
                  sphere than these lesser luminaries.
                  Now that <hi>Matthias</hi> had
                  before been
                  one of the seventy, appeareth
                  by the concurrent testimonies
                  of <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccles.
                  Hist. c.</hi> 12. <hi> l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.
                  and of <hi>Epiphanius contr. haeres.</hi> 20.
                  <hi>n.</hi> 4. to whom,
                  for brevity sake, I refer the Reader. And this the
                  rather, because the Scripture is
                  so full and pregnant in it; it being
                  a condition, or qualification, if you will,
                  required
                  by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in those that
                  were
                  the <hi>Candidates</hi>
                  for so high a Dignity,
                
                <hi>that they accompanied
                  the Apostles
                  all the time that the Lord Jesus
                  went
                  in and out amongst them.</hi>
                  And that we know none did,
                  but the <hi>Seventy</hi> only. So then it
                  is
                  most clear, and manifest, both by authority of
                  Scripture, and consent of Fathers,
                  that our Saviour instituted
                  in his Church two ranks
                  of <hi>Ministers,</hi>
                  the one subordinate unto the other: and
                  consequently,
                  laid
                  the first foundations
                  of it, in such a Fatherly, and moderate
                  <hi>imparity,</hi> as bound
                  all following
                  times
                  and ages,
                  that would not willingly
                  oppose so
                  Divine an
                  Ordinance, to observe the like.
              </p>
              <p>
                And yet it is
                  not to be thought, that this <hi>superiority</hi> thus
                  by him
                  established,
                
                doth contradict those other passages
                  of holy Scripture, wherein he doth prohibit all
                  dominion
                  over one another. They much mistake the business who
                  conceive it so. The <hi>Jews</hi>
                  in general, and all the followers
                  of Christ particularly,
                  expected
                  that the promised
                  <hi>Messiah</hi> should come with power, restore again
                  the lustre of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Kingdom, and free
                  them
                  from that yoke and bondage, which by the
                  <hi>Romans</hi>
                  had
                  been
                  laid
                  upon them.
                  <hi>We thought,</hi> said
                  <hi>Cleophas, that this had
                  been
                  he that should have delivered
                  Israel.</hi>
                
                And what he thought, was
                  solemnly
                  expected
                  by all the rest.
                
                <hi>Domine, si in tempore hoc restitues regnum Israel,
                  Lord,</hi> say they, even in the very moment of his
                  Ascension, <hi>wilt
                  thou at this time restore again the Kingdom unto
                  Israel?</hi> Upon which fancy and
                  imagination,
                  no marvail
                  if they harboured
                  some ambitious thought; every one
                  hoping
                  for the nearest
                  places,
                  both of power and trust about his person. This
                  was
                  the greatness
                  which they aimed
                  at: and this our Saviour laboured
                  to divery them
                  from: by interdicting
                  all such power and Empire, as Princes,
                  and the favourites
                  of Princes
                  have upon their Vassals.
                  <hi>Ye know</hi> (saith
                  he) <hi>that the Princes
                  of the Gentiles
                  exercise Dominion over them,
                  and they that are great exercise auhtority upon
                  them:</hi>
                  Vobis autem
                  non sic,
                
                <hi>But so it shall not be amongst you.</hi> Where
                  plainly
                  it appears,
                  both by the Text and context: first, that this strife
                  and contestation was
                  only amongst the twelve <hi>Apostles;</hi>
                  and therefore
                  howsoever it may prove that there
                  was
                  to be a parity or equality amongst
                  themselves,
                  yet it will never prove, but that they
                  were,
                  and might be still superiour
                  unto the <hi>Seventy.</hi> And secondly,
                  that Christ our Saviour doth not prohibit
                  them
                  the use and exercise of all authority, on those who
                  were
                  inferiour
                  and subordinate to them;
                  but only such authority as the Princes
                  of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  and the great Lords
                  and Ministers
                  about them
                  did
                  exercise upon their Subjects.
                  The power and government of
                
                
                
                the Apostles
                  in the Church of Christ was
                  meerly
                  , such as a Father
                  beareth
                  unto his children:
                  but not , a Lordly, and imperious
                  Rule, such as a Master exerciseth
                  on his slaves
                  and servants:
                
                <hi>Not as Lords
                  over Gods
                  inheritance, but as the helpers
                  of their joy,</hi> say the two Apostles,
                  and herein stands
                  the difference, according
                  unto that of <hi>Chrysostom, Principes mundi ideo fiunt,
                  ut dominentur minoribus suis,</hi> The
                  Princes
                  of the Earth were
                  made
                  to this end and purpose, that they might Lord it over
                  their inferiours,
                  and make them
                  slaves,
                  and spoil them,
                  and devour them,
                  abasing
                  them
                  unto the death, for their own profit and glory:
                  <hi>Principes autem
                  Ecclesiae fiunt, c.</hi> But the
                  Governours
                  or Princes
                  of the Church were
                  instituted
                  to another end, <hi>viz.</hi> To serve their
                  inferiours,
                  and to minister unto them
                  all such things,
                  as they have received
                  from the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
                This eminence and superiority over all the Church,
                
                which was
                  thus setled
                  in the Apostles
                  by our Lord and Saviour, will appear more
                  fully,
                  if we consult the several ministrations
                  committed
                  unto them,
                  and to them
                  alone. For unto them
                  alone it was,
                  that Christ committed
                  the whole power of <hi>preaching</hi>
                  of his holy Word, administring
                  his blessed
                  Sacraments,
                  retaining
                  and forgiving
                  sins,
                  ruling
                  and ordering
                  of his flock: giving
                  them
                  also further power of instituting,
                  and ordaining
                  such, by whom
                  these several Offices
                  were
                  to be performed
                  till his second coming.
                  None but the Twelve were
                  present with him,
                  when he ordained
                  the blessed
                  Sacrament of his body and blood:
                
                and unto them
                  alone was
                  said
                  <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> do this: <hi>i. e.</hi> take bread,
                  and break, and bless it, and distribute it, <hi>in
                  remembrance of me.</hi> To the eleven alone it
                  was
                  that he gave
                  commission to go into all the World and preach the
                  Gospel to all creatures,
                
                baptizing
                  them
                  in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. They
                  only had
                  that powerful and immediate mission,
                
                <hi>Sicut misit me Pater,</hi> As my Father
                  sent
                  me, so send I you; and upon them
                  alone he <hi>breathed,</hi>
                  saying,
                  <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost: whose
                  sins
                  ye do remit, they are remitted
                  unto them;
                  and whose sins
                  you do retain, they are retained.</hi>
                  Finally,
                  they, and none but they were
                  trusted
                  with the feeding,
                  and the governance of the Flock of Christ, (the word
                   in the <hi>Greek</hi> doth imply
                  them
                  both) for howsoever <hi>Pasce oves meas,</hi>
                
                was
                  in particular spoken
                  to Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> yet was
                  that charge incumbent on them
                  all, as before we noted
                  from Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> By all which
                  passages
                  and Texts
                  of Scripture, it is
                  clear and manifest, that the Apostles
                  were
                  by Christ ordained
                  to be the sole and ordinary Teachers,
                  Bishops,
                  and Pastors
                  of the Church, next and immediately
                  under his most blessed
                  self,
                
                who still continueth
                  , <hi>the great
                  Shepheard
                  of the Sheep,</hi> as <hi>Paul; the
                  Shepheard
                  and Bishop of our Souls,</hi>
                  as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls
                  him.
                  The Seventy had
                  no part in this new Commission,
                  the dispensation of the Word, and
                  Sacraments,
                  but at second hand; as they were
                  afterwards
                  intrusted
                  with it, by the holy Apostles,
                  either as Prophets,
                  Presbyters,
                  or Evangelists,
                  according
                  to the measure of the Grace which
                  was
                  given
                  unto them:
                  or specially
                  designed
                  to some part therein, after the Ascension of our Lord
                  and Saviour, by the immediate designation of the Holy
                  Ghost. And when they were
                  entrusted
                  with a part thereof, yet were
                  they still <hi>secundi Ordinis,</hi>
                  Ministers
                  of a second rank, inferiour
                  unto the Apostles,
                  both in place and power, to whom
                  all latitude of power was
                  given.
                  Nay, the Apostles
                  took
                  an
                  hint from this different mission, to
                  institute
                  two several sorts
                  of Ministers
                  in the Church of Christ: the one subordinate unto the
                  other, as were
                  the Seventy unto them.
                  And this by vertue
                  of these words
                  in their Commission, <hi>Ita mitto vos;</hi> i. e. as
                  the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> very well
                  applyeth
                  it,
                
                <hi>Sicut ego  Patre habui potestatem eligendi
                  Ministros, etiam diversi ordinis, ita  vos pariter
                  habeatis. As I received
                  power from my heavenly Father, of
                  instituting
                  Ministers,
                  even of divers
                  Orders,
                  so I give it you.</hi> And therefore whatsoever the
                  Apostles
                  did
                  therein, they did
                  it after Christs example, and by his authority: and
                  consequently,
                  the imparity of Ministers
                  by them
                  ordained,
                  was
                  founded
                  on the Law of God, and the original institution of our
                  Saviour Christ, by whom
                  the power of Ordination was
                  to them
                  committed,
                  and by them
                  unto their Successours
                  in the Church for ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                To bring this Chapter to an
                  end,
                
                our Saviour Christ having
                  thus furnished
                  his Apostles
                  with those several powers,
                  faculties,
                  and preheminences
                  which before we spake
                  of; he thought it best to recommend
                  them
                  to the blessings
                  of Almighty God, whose work they
                  were
                  to go about. And therefore being
                  to take his fare-well of them,
                
                did
                  in a very solemn manner bestow his benediction on
                  them.
                  <hi>Elevatis manibus
                  suis benedixit eis,</hi> he lifted
                  up his hands,
                  and blessed
                  them,
                  as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath
                  it. Which benediction Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  takes
                  to be a consecrating
                  of those holy men
                  unto the power and dignity of Bishops.
                
                <hi>Ipse enim priusquam in caelos ascenderet, imponens

                  Father hath
                  it. Which whether it were
                  so or not, I mean so done
                  with such an
                  outward Form and Ceremony, and in that very point of
                  time, is
                  perhaps uncertain: But sure I am,
                  that for the thing it self, which
                  is
                  here delivered,
                  the Fathers,
                  many of them
                  do agree with <hi>Austin;</hi> affirming,
                  <hi>passim,</hi> in their writings,
                  that the Apostles
                  were
                  made
                  Bishops
                  by our blessed
                  Lord. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> voucheth
                  it expresly.
                  The Deacons
                  ought to understand,
                
                <hi>quoniam Apostolos,</hi>
                  i. e. <hi>Episcopos,  Praepositos Dominus
                  elegit,</hi> that the Lord Christ himself
                  did
                  chuse
                  the Apostles,
                  that is,
                  the Bishops
                  and Rulers
                  of the Church, and that the Apostles
                  after his ascension did
                  ordain the Deacons
                  to be the Ministers
                  of their Episcopal function, and the
                  necessities
                  of the Church. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth affirm the
                  same,
                
                <hi>Caput it aque in Ecclesia Apostolos posuit,
                  c.</hi> Christ, saith
                  he, made
                  the Apostles
                  the head (or supreme
                  Governours)
                  of his Church, they being
                  the Legats
                  or Ambassadours
                  of Christ, according
                  unto that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And then
                  he adds,
                  <hi>Ipsi sunt Episcopi,</hi>
                  that they were
                  Bishops.
                  More plainly
                  in his Comment on the <hi>Ephesians,
                  Apostoli
                  Episcopi sunt, Prophetae, explanatores
                  Scripturarum,</hi> The Apostles,
                  saith
                  he,
                
                are Bishops,
                  and Prophets,
                  the Expositors
                  of Scripture. But because question
                  hath
                  been
                  made,
                  whether indeed those Commentaries
                  are the works
                  of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or of some other ancient Writer; he
                  tells
                  us in his Notes
                  on the 43. <hi>Psalm,</hi> that in those
                  words
                  of Christ, <hi>Pasce oves meas, Peter</hi>
                  was
                  made
                  a Bishop by our Lord and Saviour.
                
                <hi>Significat
                  Ambrosius Petrum Sacerdotem, hoc est, Episcopum electum,
                  illis verbis, Pasce oves meas:</hi> as the place
                  is
                  cited
                  by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalato.</hi> And thus Saint
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaking
                  of the election of the Seven, saith
                  plainly,
                  , that then there
                  were
                  no Bishops
                  in the Church,
                
                but only the Apostles.
              </p>
              <p>
                But what need more be said
                  in the present business,
                
                than that which is
                  delivered
                  in the holy Scripture, about the surrogation of some
                  other in the place of <hi>Judas:</hi> wherein the place
                  or function of an
                  Apostle is
                  plainly
                  called
                  <hi>Episcopatus;</hi>
                
                <hi>Episcopatum ejus accipiat alter,</hi> let another
                  take his Bishoprick,
                  as the <hi>English</hi> reads
                  it. His Bishoprick,
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> saith
                  <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> , his
                  Principality, his Priesthood,
                
                the place of government that belonged
                  unto him,
                  had
                  he kept
                  his station. A Text most plain and pregnant as the
                  Fathers
                  thought, to prove that the <hi>Episcopal</hi> dignity
                  was
                  vested
                  in the persons
                  of the Lords
                  Apostles.
                  The Comment under the name of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which
                  before we spake
                  of, having
                  said,
                  <hi>Ipsi sunt Episcopi,</hi>
                
                that the Apostles
                  were
                  Bishops,
                  adds
                  for the proof thereof these words
                  of <hi>Peter, Episcopatum ejus accipiat
                  alter.</hi> And the true <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                  saying
                  of <hi>Judas,</hi>
                
                that he was
                  a Bishop <hi>[Episcopus enim  Judas fuit]</hi>
                  adds
                  for the proof thereof the same very Text.
                  Finally,
                  to conclude this matter, Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  shewing
                  that Ordinations
                  were
                  not made
                  without the
                  privity of the people, in the Jewish Church,
                
                adds
                  that the same was
                  afterwards
                  observed
                  by the holy Apostles,
                  <hi>Quando de ordinando in locum Judae Episcopo;</hi>
                  when <hi>Peter</hi> spake
                  unto the people, about the ordering
                  of a Bishop in the place of <hi>Judas.</hi> But for a
                  further proof of this, that the
                  Apostles
                  were
                  ordained
                  Bishops
                  by our Lord and Saviour, we shall see more hereafter in
                  convenient place,
                
                when we are come to shew,
                  that in the government of the Church, the
                  Bishops
                  were
                  the proper Successors
                  of the Apostles;
                  and so esteemed
                  to be by those, who otherwise were
                  no great friends
                  unto <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> In the mean time, we may take
                  notice of that impudent assertion of <hi>Jobannes de
                  Turrecremata:</hi> viz. <hi>Quod solus Petrus 
                  Christo Episcopus est ordinatus:</hi>
                
                that <hi>Peter,</hi> only <hi>Peter</hi>
                  was
                  made
                  Bishop by our Saviour Christ, and that the rest of the
                  Apostles
                  received
                  from <hi>Peter</hi> their Episcopal consecration:
                  wherein I find him
                  seconded
                  by <hi>Dominicus Jacobatius, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de
                  Concil.
                  Art.</hi> 7. A Paradox so monstrous and absurd, that
                  howsoever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth reckon it amongst
                  other the Prerogatives
                  of that Apostle, in his first Book <hi>de Romano
                  Pontifice,</hi> cap. 23. yet upon better
                  thoughts,
                  he rejects
                  it utterly
                  in his 4th Book upon that argument, <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.
                  and so I leave it.
              </p>
              <p>Thus having
                shewn
                in what estate the Church was
                founded
                by our Saviour, and in what terms
                he left it unto his Apostles:
                we must next see what course was
                taken
                by them
                to promote the same, what use they
                made
                of that authority which was
                trusted
                to them.</p>

                  for so great a work.
                
                <hi>And when he had
                  spoken
                  those things,
                  while they beheld,
                  he was
                  taken
                  up, and a Cloud received
                  him
                  out of their sight.</hi> No sooner
                  was
                  he gone
                  to the Heavenly glories,
                  but the Apostles
                  with the rest, withdrew
                  themselves unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  as he had
                  appointed;
                  where the first care they took
                  was,
                  to fill up their number,
                  to surrogate some one or other of the
                  Disciples
                  in the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> that so the Word of God
                  might be fulfilled,
                
                which he had
                  spoken
                  by the Psalmist, <hi>Episcopatum ejus accipiat
                  alter.</hi> A business of no small importance, and
                  therefore fit to be imparted
                  unto all the Brethren; not so much that their suffrage
                  and consent herein was
                  necessary,
                  as that they might together joyn
                  in prayer to Almighty God,
                
                to direct the action, whose business indeed it
                  was,
                  and unto whom
                  alone the whole election properly
                  pertained.
                  All that they did
                  was
                  to propose two men
                  unto the Lord their God (<hi>Et statuerunt duos,</hi>
                
                saith
                  the Text) such as they thought most fit for so great a
                  charge, and so to leave it to his providence, to
                  shew
                  and manifest which of the two he
                  pleased
                  to choose. In the appointment of which two, whether that
                  <hi>statuerunt</hi> being
                  a Verb of the Plural number, be to be
                  referred
                  to all the multitude, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                  is
                  of opinion, or only unto the Apostles,
                  and the Seventy, as some others think, it
                  comes
                  all to one. For the whole number
                  being
                  but an
                  hundred and twenty,
                
                and being
                  that the Apostles
                  with the Seventy (out of which rank the nomination of
                  the two was
                  made)
                  made
                  up the number of fourscore; it must
                  needs
                  be that the appointment in effect
                  was
                  in them
                  alone. And though I rather do incline to
                  <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in this particular, that the
                  appointment of these two was
                  done
                  by all the multitude in general;
                
                yet I can yield by no means
                  to the next that followeth.
                  For shewing
                  some politick
                  and worldly reasons,
                  why <hi>Peter</hi> did
                  permit the people to have an
                  interest in the business, he first
                  asked
                  this question, [
                  ; whether it
                  were
                  not lawful for Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to have
                  chose
                  the man. And then he answereth
                  positively,
                  , that it was
                  most lawful, but that he did
                  forbear to do it, lest he might seem to do it out of
                  partiality. In this I must crave leave to dissent from
                  <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> The power of
                  making
                  an
                  Apostle was
                  too high a priviledge
                  to be intrusted
                  unto any of the Sons
                  of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                
                <hi>Paul</hi> was
                  not made
                  Apostle, though an
                  Abortive one, as he calls
                  himself, <hi>either of men,
                  or by men,
                  but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father.</hi> What
                  priviledge
                  or
                
                
                power soever <hi>Peter</hi> had
                  as an
                  Apostle of the Lord in making
                  Bishops,
                  or as a Bishop of the Church in
                  ordaining
                  Presbyters;
                  he had
                  no power to make Apostles.
                  The Pope might sing <hi>Placebo,</hi> if it
                  had
                  been
                  otherwise; and we should have Apostles
                  more than ten times
                  twelve, if nothing were
                  required
                  unto it, but Saint <hi>Peters
                  Fiat.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                But to proceed: This weighty business
                  being
                  thus dispatched,
                
                and <hi>Matthias</hi> who before
                  was
                  of the Seventy, being
                  numbred
                  with the eleven Apostles,
                  it pleased
                  God to make good his promise of
                  pouring
                  on them
                  in a plentiful and signal manner the
                  gifts
                  and graces
                  of his holy Spirit. Not on the Twelve alone, or the
                  Seventy only, but on the whole body of the
                  Disciples,
                  even on the whole 120. which before we
                  spake
                  of. I know that <hi>Beza</hi> and some others, would
                  limit this effusion of the Holy Ghost to the Twelve
                  alone. Why, and to what intent he doth so resolve it,
                  though I may guess perhaps, yet I will not judge; but
                  sure it is,
                  he so resolves
                  it.
                
                <hi>Solis Apostolis propria est haec Spiritus sancti
                  missio, sicut proprius fuit Apostolatus,</hi> as his own
                  words
                  are in his Annotations
                  on the Text. The same he also doth affirm in his Book
                  <hi>de Ministrorum Evangelii gradibus,</hi> cap. 5. But
                  herein <hi>Beza</hi> leaves
                  the Fathers
                  and the Text to boot. Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  tells
                  us, that the Holy Ghost came
                  from Heaven,
                
                <hi> implevit uno loco sedentes centum
                  viginti,</hi> and filled
                  one hundred and twenty sitting
                  in one place. Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                  affirms
                  the same, , <hi>c.</hi> what
                  (saith
                  he) did
                  it come on the twelve alone, not upon the rest? And then
                  he answereth,
                  , not so by no
                  means,
                  it fell on all the 120 which were
                  there Assembled.
                  Nor doth he only say it, but he
                  proves
                  it also, alledging
                  in defence of his assertion that very plea and argument
                  which was
                  used
                  by <hi>Peter,</hi> to clear himself and his
                  associates
                  from the imputation
                  of being
                  drunken
                  with new wine,
                
                <hi>viz. Hoc est quod dictum fuit per Prophetam
                  Joel,</hi> This is
                  that which was
                  spoken
                  by the Prophet <hi>Joel, I will pour out of my Spirit
                  upon all flesh,</hi> c. Besides,
                  the text and context make it plain enough, that this
                  effusion
                  of the Holy Ghost was
                  upon them
                  all.
                
                In the first Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi>
                  we find them
                  <hi>all together</hi> (the whole 120.) <hi>with one
                  accord:</hi> And in the first verse of the second
                  Chapter, we find them
                  <hi>all together with the same accord:</hi> And then it
                  followeth
                  that there appeared
                  cloven
                  tongues,
                  like as of fire, <hi>seditque supra singulos eorum,</hi>
                
                and sate upon each of them;
                  <hi>and they were
                  all filled
                  with the Holy Ghost.</hi> If they
                  were
                  <hi>all together</hi> (as we found before) and <hi>all
                  were
                  filled
                  with the Holy Ghost:</hi> No question but there
                  were
                  more filled
                  with it than the twelve Apostles.
                  And when as <hi>Peter with the eleven
                  stood
                  up,</hi> making
                  an
                  Apology for the rest, and saying,
                  <hi>These men
                  are not drunken,</hi>
                
                <hi>as ye suppose;</hi> it must
                  needs
                  be that others, besides
                  the twelve, and indeed all the company
                  were
                  suspected
                  of it. Add, as by way of surplusage, and <hi>ex
                  abundanti,</hi> that the Seven chosen
                  by the multitude to <hi>serve the
                  Tables,</hi>
                  who questionless were
                  of the number of the Seventy, are
                  said
                  to have been
                  <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
                
                before that the Apostles
                  had
                  laid
                  hands
                  on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                So then it is
                  most evident, as I conceive it,
                
                that the Holy Ghost was
                  given
                  to every one of the Disciples,
                  the whole number of them,
                  to every one according
                  to his place and station, according
                  to that service and imployment,
                  in which the Lord intended
                  to make use of them.
                  <hi>For unto one was
                  given
                  by the spirit the word of Wisdom,</hi>
                
                <hi>to another the word of Knowledge, and to another the
                  gift of healing
                  by the same spirit; to another the
                  working
                  of Miracles,
                  to another Prophesie,
                  to another discerning
                  of Spirits,
                  to another divers
                  kinds
                  of Tongues,
                  to another the interpretation of
                  Tongues.</hi>
                  Every one of them
                  had
                  their several gifts;
                  the Apostles
                  all ,
                
                as we read in <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> Whatever
                  was
                  divided
                  amongst the residue for the advancement of
                  Gods
                  glory, and the improvement of his Church, that
                  was
                  united
                  in the persons
                  of the holy Apostles,
                  whom
                  God had
                  ranked
                  as much above them
                  in their gifts
                  and graces,
                  as they were
                  in place. By means
                  whereof it came
                  to pass, that howsoever the Lord out of these 120
                  made
                  choice of some to be Evangelists,
                  some to be Prophets,
                  and others to be Pastors,
                  Presbyters,
                  and Teachers;
                  yet the Apostles
                  still retained
                  their superiority,
                  ordering
                  and directing
                  them
                  in their several Ministeries
                  to the best edifying
                  of the Church. For thus we read how <hi>Paul</hi>
                  disposed
                  of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who
                  were
                  both Evangelists;
                  sending
                  them,
                  as the occasions
                  of the Church required,
                  from <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> and then back to
                  <hi>Asia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Italy.</hi> How he
                  sent
                  <hi>Crescens</hi> to <hi>Galatia,</hi>
                
                <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Dalmatia, Tychicus</hi> to
                  <hi>Ephesus;</hi> commanding
                  <hi>Erastus</hi> to abide at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
                  using
                  the Ministery
                  of <hi>Luke</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                
                So find we how he ordered
                  those that had
                  the spirit of Prophecy, and such as
                  had
                  the gift of tongues,
                  that every one might use his talent unto edification;
                  how he ordained
                  Bishops
                  in one place, Elders
                  or Presbyters
                  in another, as we shall se_
                  hereafter in this following
                  story. The like we may affirm
                
                
                
                of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also, and of the rest of the
                  Apostles,
                  though there be less left upon record
                  of their Acts
                  and Writings,
                  than are remaining
                  of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> whose mouths
                  and pens
                  being
                  guided
                  by the Holy Ghost, have been
                  the Canon ever since of all saving
                  truth. For howsoever <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  two of the Evangelists,
                  have left behind
                  them
                  no small part of the Book of God, of their own
                  enditing;
                  yet were
                  not either
                  of their writings
                  reckoned
                  as Canonical in respect of the Authors,
                  but as they had
                  been
                  taken
                  from the Apostles
                  mouths,
                  and ratified
                  by their Authority, as both Saint <hi>Luke</hi> himself,
                
                and the Fathers
                  testifie.
                  And for a further mark of difference
                  between the
                  Apostles
                  and the rest of the Disciples,
                  we may take this also; that though the rest of the
                  Disciples
                  had
                  all received
                  the Holy Ghost, yet none could give the same but the
                  Apostles
                  only. Insomuch that when <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist
                  had
                  preached
                  the Gospel in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and
                  converted
                  many, and Baptized
                  them
                  in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; yet none of
                  them
                  received
                  the Holy Ghost till <hi>Peter.</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
                  came
                  down unto them,
                  and <hi>prayed
                  for them,
                  and laid
                  their hands
                  on them,</hi>
                  as the Scriptures
                  witness. That was
                  a priviledge
                  reserved
                  to the Apostles,
                  and to none but them.
                  ,
                
                as it is
                  in <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> And when the two
                  Apostles
                  did
                  it, they did
                  it without <hi>Philips</hi>
                  help or co-operation, who joyned
                  not in it, nor contributed
                  at all to so great a work, for ought we find in holy
                  Scripture.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this regard it is
                  no marvel,
                
                if in the enumerating
                  of those ministrations
                  which did
                  concur in the first founding
                  of the Church, the Apostles
                  always
                  have preheminence.
                  First,
                
                <hi>Apostles:</hi>
                  Secondarily,
                  <hi>Prophets:</hi>
                  Thirdly,
                  <hi>Teachers,</hi>
                  c. as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath
                  ranked
                  them.
                  Nor did
                  he rank them
                  so by chance, but gave
                  to every one his proper place,
                
                , saith
                  Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> first
                  placing
                  that which was
                  most excellent, and afterwards
                  descending
                  unto those of a lower rank. Which
                  plainly
                  shews,
                  that in the composition of the Church there
                  was
                  a <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>posterius</hi> in regard of
                  order, a , or more honourable, as
                  the Father calls
                  it, in regard
                  of power; as in the constitution of the body natural, to
                  which the Church is
                  there resembled,
                  some of the members
                  do direct, and some obey, some of
                  them
                  being
                  honourable,
                
                some feeble, but all necessary. The like may also be
                  observed
                  out of the 4. chap. of the same Apostle unto the
                  <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  where the Apostles
                  are first placed
                  and ranked
                  above the rest of the ministrations,
                  Prophets,
                  Evangelists,
                  Pastors,
                  and Teachers,
                  of which some were
                  to be but temporary in the Church of God, the others to
                  remain for ever.
                
                For as Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> doth
                  exceeding
                  well expound that Scripture, ,
                  First, <hi>he doth name Apostles,
                  as they in whom
                  all powers
                  and graces
                  were
                  united:</hi>
                  Secondly,
                  <hi>Prophets,
                  such as was</hi>
                  Agabus <hi>in the</hi> Acts:
                  Thirdly,
                  <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
                  , <hi>such as
                  had
                  made
                  no progress into many Countries,
                  but preached
                  the Gospel in some certain Regions,
                  as</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priscilla; <hi>and then</hi>
                  Pastors
                  <hi>and</hi> Teachers,
                  <hi>who had
                  the government of a Country or Nation,</hi>
                  , <hi>such as
                  were
                  setled
                  and employed
                  in a certain place or City, as</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi>
                  Titus. If then a question should be
                  made,
                  whom
                  S. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth
                  here by Pastors
                  and Teachers;
                  I answer, it is
                  meant
                  of Bishops,
                  , as the Father
                  hath
                  it, such as were
                  placed
                  over some certain Cities;
                  and that the Bishops
                  were
                  accounted
                  in the ancient times
                  the only ordinary Pastors
                  of the Church, in the room and stead of the
                  Apostles,
                  we shall shew
                  hereafter.
                
                And this I am
                  the rather induced
                  to think, because that in the first Epistle to those of
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi> written
                  when as there were
                  but few Bishops
                  of particular Cities,
                  S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth speak of Teachers
                  only; but here in this to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  writ at such time as <hi>Timothy</hi> and
                  <hi>Titus,</hi> and many others
                  had
                  formerly
                  been
                  ordained
                  Bishops,
                  he adds
                  Pastors
                  also.
                
                Certain I am
                  that both <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi>
                  do expound the words
                  by Bishops
                  only, , such
                  Bishops
                  as both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
                  were
                  by them
                  accounted.
                  Nay, even Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
                  seemeth
                  to incline this way,
                
                making
                  the Prelates
                  of the Church, or the <hi>Praesides Ecclesiae,</hi> as
                  he calls
                  them
                  there, to be the Pastors
                  and Teachers
                  mentioned
                  by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> i.e. <hi>Pastores
                  ovium, magistros hominum;</hi> Pastors
                  in reference to their Flocks,
                  Teachers
                  in reference to their Disciples.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to go on unto our story.
                
                Our Saviour having
                  thus enabled
                  and supplyed
                  his labourers
                  with the gifts
                  and graces
                  of his Spirit, it could not be but that the Harvest
                  went
                  on apace.
                
                The first <hi>day added
                  to the Church</hi> 3000 <hi>souls.</hi>
                  And after that, <hi>God added
                  daily to it such as should be saved.</hi>
                  The miracle wrought
                  by the hands
                  of the two Apostles
                  at the <hi>Beautiful gate,</hi>
                
                opened
                  a large door to the further increase thereof. For
                  presently
                  upon the same, and <hi>Peters</hi>
                  Sermon made
                  upon that occasion, we find that the <hi>number of the
                  men
                  which heard
                  the word and believed,</hi>
                
                <hi>was
                  about five thousand.</hi>
                
                
                Not that there were
                  so many added
                  to the former number, as to make up five
                  thousand
                  in the total; but that there were
                  five thousand added
                  to the Church more than had
                  been
                  formerly;
                  S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi>
                
                both affirming
                  that there were
                  more converted
                  by this second Sermon of Saint <hi>Peters,</hi>
                  than by the first. So that the Church
                  increasing
                  daily more and more, <hi>multitudes
                  both of men
                  and women
                  being
                  continually
                  added
                  to the Lord,</hi> and their numbers
                  growing
                  dreadful to the Jewish Magistrates;
                
                it seemed
                  good to the Apostles,
                
                (who by the intimation of the Spirit found that there
                  would be work enough elsewhere) to choose one or other
                  of their sacred number, to be the Bishop of that Church,
                  and take charge thereof. And this they
                  did
                  not now by lots,
                  but in the ordinary course and manner of election,
                  pitching
                  on <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpheus,</hi>
                
                who in regard of consanguinity is
                  sometimes
                  called
                  in Scripture the Lords
                  Brother; and in regard of his exceeding
                  piety and uprightness, was
                  surnamed
                  the <hi>Just.</hi> Which action I have
                  placed
                  here, even in the cradle of the Church upon good
                  Authority. For first, <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  tells
                  us out of <hi>Clemens,</hi> that this
                  was
                  done
                  ,
                
                after the Ascension of our Saviour; <hi>Hierome</hi>
                  more plainly,
                  <hi>statim post passionem Domini,</hi>
                  immediately
                  upon his passion.
                
                We may with good security
                  conclude from both, that it was
                  done
                  not long after Christs Ascension, as soon almost as the
                  Believers
                  were
                  increased
                  to a considerable number. And lastly,
                
                that <hi>Ignatius</hi> hath
                  made
                  S. <hi>Stephen</hi> to be the Deacon, or subservient
                  Minister to this <hi>James</hi> the Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                  and then we must needs
                  place it in some middle time, between the Feast of
                  <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and the 26. of <hi>December,</hi>
                  when Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was
                  Martyred.
                  So early did
                  the Lord take care to provide Bishops
                  for his Church, and set apart a special Pastor for his
                  holy City.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Tis true, there is
                  no manifest record hereof in holy Scripture,
                
                but then withal it is
                  as true, that in the Scripture there are many pregnant
                  circumstances,
                  whereon the truth hereof may well be
                  grounded.
                
                Saint <hi>Paul</hi> some three years
                  after his Conversion,
                  <hi>went
                  up unto</hi> Hierusalem
                  <hi>to see</hi> Peter, but found no other of the
                  Apostles
                  there, save only <hi>James</hi> the
                  Lords
                  Brother. Ask <hi>Hierome,</hi> who this <hi>James</hi>
                  was,
                  whom
                  S. <hi>Paul</hi> then saw,
                  and he will tell you that it was
                  <hi>James</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                <hi>Hic autem
                  Jacobus Episcopus Hierosolymorum primus fuit, cognomento
                  Justus.</hi> And then withal, we have the reason why
                  <hi>Paul</hi> should find him
                  at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  more than the rest of the Apostles,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> because the rest of the
                  Apostles
                  were
                  dispersed
                  abroad, according
                  to the exigence of their occasions;
                  and <hi>James</hi> was
                  there residing
                  on his Pastoral or Episcopal charge. Fourteen
                  years
                  after his Conversion,
                
                being
                  the eleventh year after the former interview, he
                  went
                  up into <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  again, with <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and
                  was
                  together
                  present with them
                  at the first general Council, held
                  by the Apostles.
                  In which, upon the agitation of the business there
                  proposed,
                  the Canon and determination is
                  drawn
                  up positively
                  and expresly
                  in the words
                  of <hi>James.</hi>
                
                Do you desire the reason of it, <hi>Peter</hi> and
                  others being
                  there? <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on those
                  words
                  of Scripture,
                
                <hi>James</hi> answered
                  saying,
                  doth express it thus, , this
                  <hi>James</hi> was
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  And this no question was
                  the reason, why <hi>Paul</hi> reciting
                  the names
                  of those with whom
                  especially
                  he had
                  conference at his being
                  there, puts
                  <hi>James</hi> in the first place before <hi>Peter</hi>
                  and <hi>John, viz.</hi>
                
                because that he was
                  Bishop there, as <hi>Estius</hi>
                  hath
                  noted
                  on that Text. The Council being
                  ended,
                  <hi>Paul</hi> returneth to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and there
                  by reason of some men
                  that came
                  from <hi>James, Peter</hi> withdrew,
                
                and separated
                  himself, <hi>eating
                  no longer
                  with the Gentiles.</hi>
                  Why takes
                  the Apostle such especial notice that they
                  came
                  from <hi>James,</hi> but because they
                  were
                  sent
                  from him,
                  as from their Bishop, about some business of the Church;
                  this <hi>James</hi> being
                  then Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                [] as both <hi>Theophylact</hi> and
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> note upon the place.
                  Finally,
                  nine years
                  after this, being
                  the 58. of Christs Nativity, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  makes
                  his last journey to <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                  still he finds
                  <hi>James</hi> there.
                
                <hi>And the day following</hi>
                  Paul <hi>went
                  in with us unto</hi> James, <hi>c.</hi> as the Text
                  informs
                  us.
                
                <hi>Chrysostom</hi> notes
                  upon the
                  place, that <hi>James</hi> there
                  spoken
                  of was
                  the Lords
                  Brother, , and Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  So that for 20 years
                  together, we have apparent
                  evidence in Scripture of <hi>James</hi>
                  residing
                  at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  and that as Bishop there, as the
                  Fathers
                  say.
              </p>
              <p>
                For that Saint <hi>James</hi> was
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                there is
                  almost no ancient Writer but bears
                  witness of it. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
                  was
                  made
                  Bishop of <hi>Antiochia,</hi>
                
                within eight years
                  after the Death and Martyrdom of this <hi>James</hi> in
                  their account, who place it latest,
                  makes
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> to be the Deacon of this
                  <hi>James,</hi> as <hi>Clemens</hi> and
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> were
                  to <hi>Peter;</hi> which is
                  an
                  implication that <hi>James</hi>
                  was
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  out of which
                
                
                
                City we do not find that <hi>Stephen</hi> ever
                  travelled.
                  <hi>Egesippus,</hi> who lived
                  near the Apostles
                  times,
                
                makes
                  this <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  as both Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> have
                  told
                  us from him.
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> not long after
                  him,
                  doth confirm the same. And out of
                  him
                  and other monuments
                  of antiquity, <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth assure us of
                  him,
                  , that he was
                  the first that held
                  the Episcopal throne or chair in the Church of
                  <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi>
                
                Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  speaks
                  of him
                  as of his Predecessor, [] in that
                  Church, , as the first Bishop of
                  that Diocess.
                  And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for his
                  greater
                  credit, makes
                  him
                  not only the first Bishop that ever
                  was,
                  <hi>Haeres.</hi> 29. n. 3. but Bishop of the
                  Lords
                  own Throne, ,
                
                and that too by the Lords
                  appointment.
                  S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth assign this reason, why
                  <hi>Paul</hi> going
                  unto <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  to see <hi>Peter,</hi>
                
                should find <hi>James</hi> there, <hi>quia illic
                  constitutus erat Episcopus ab Apostolis,</hi> because
                  that by the rest of the Apostles
                  he was
                  made
                  Bishop of that place. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> doth not
                  only affirm as much, as for his
                  being
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  but also doth lay down the time of his Creation to be
                  not long after our Redeemers
                  passion, as we saw
                  before. Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                
                besides
                  what was
                  alledged
                  from him
                  in the former Section, tells
                  in his Homilies
                  on S. <hi>Johns</hi>
                  Gospel, , that Saint <hi>James</hi>
                  had
                  the Bishoprick
                  of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  Where by the way I cannot but take notice of a lewd
                  forgery, or at the best a gross mistake of
                  <hi>Baronius,</hi> who to advance the
                  Soveraignty
                  of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                will have this <hi>James</hi> to take the
                  Bishoprick
                  of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  from Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  hands,
                  and cites
                  this place of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> for proof
                  thereof.
                  But surely
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith
                  no such matter; for putting
                  the question, how <hi>James</hi>
                  was
                  made
                  the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  since <hi>Pasce oves meas</hi> was
                  said
                  to <hi>Peter;</hi> returns
                  this answer, , that Christ
                  made
                  <hi>Peter</hi> not the Pastor of a particular place, but
                  of all the universe. That <hi>James</hi>
                  received
                  his Bishoprick
                  from <hi>Peter,</hi> not one word
                  saith
                  <hi>Chrysostom:</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Latin</hi>
                  reads
                  it as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> doth; but such
                  an
                  undertaker as he was,
                  should have sought
                  the fountains.
                  As for Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
                
                he agrees
                  herein with the other Fathers,
                  in his second book against <hi>Cresconius;</hi> where
                  speaking
                  of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  he describes
                  it thus, <hi>quam primus Apostolus Jacobus Episcopatu
                  suo rexit,</hi> whereof S. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle
                  was
                  the first Bishop. Add here the joynt
                  consent and suffrage of 289 Prelates
                  in the sixth General Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                
                affirming
                  <hi>James</hi> the Lords
                  Brother to be the first Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                  not to say any thing of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> and
                  <hi>Theophylact,</hi> whom
                  before we cited.
                  Never was
                  point in issue tried
                  by a fuller evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                And yet one other circumstance occurs
                  to confirm the point,
                
                which is,
                  that till <hi>Eusebius</hi> time,
                
                the Chair, or <hi>Cathedra Episcopalis,</hi> wherein S.
                  <hi>James</hi> was
                  said
                  to be inthroned,
                  was
                  very carefully
                  preserved
                  by his Successors,
                  as a sacred Monument, and gladly
                  shewed
                  to all that desired
                  to see it; , as the Author
                  hath
                  it. An
                  evidence of no mean consideration, as
                  being
                  vouched
                  by an
                  Author that lived
                  before the superstitious reverence and esteem of
                  Reliques
                  had
                  been
                  introduced
                  into the world, or any Impostures
                  of that kind put upon the people. Unto which testimony
                  of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                
                we may add that of <hi>Beda</hi> also, who in his
                  <hi>Martyrologie</hi>
                  doth place the memorial or commemoration of the
                  Apostles
                  inthronizing
                  in that Chair or Throne upon the 27 of
                  <hi>December;</hi> wherein I dare not
                  joyn
                  with him
                  as unto the day, though I approve his observation of the
                  fact or ceremony, as being
                  every way conform to the ancient custom of the Church.
                  One only thing I have to add and
                  rectifie,
                
                which concerns
                  S. <hi>James,</hi> and is
                  briefly
                  thus. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells
                  us out of <hi>Egesippus, huic soli licitum esse ingredi
                  Sancta Sanctorum;</hi> that it was
                  only lawful to S. <hi>James</hi> to enter into the Holy
                  of Holies;
                  whereas in truth it should not be <hi>huic soli
                  licitum,</hi> but <hi>huic solitum.</hi> And this
                  appears
                  to be the true and ancient reading,
                  by comparing
                  the translation of <hi>Sophronius</hi> with S.
                  <hi>Hieroms</hi>
                  Text, wherein we have it, , c.
                  that it was
                  his custom so to do; the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  permitting
                  him
                  to enjoy that priviledge
                  in the declining
                  times
                  of their State and Temple, by reason
                  of the holiness of his conversation.
                
                Finally,
                  to conclude with <hi>Hierom,</hi> this
                  blessed
                  Man of God was
                  Martyr'd in the 7 year of <hi>Nero</hi>
                  (<hi>An.
                  Chr.</hi> 63.) <hi>postquam triginta annos Hierosolymis
                  rexerat Ecclesiam;</hi> after he
                  had
                  been
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  30 year; that is
                  to say 29 years
                  compleat,
                  and the 30 currant. By which account it must
                  needs
                  follow, that the making
                  of this <hi>James</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  was
                  one of the first actions
                  of the Apostles,
                  after they were
                  endued
                  with the Holy Ghost.
              </p>
              
              
              <p>
                <hi>James</hi> being
                  dead,
                
                <hi>Simeon</hi> another of the Lords
                  Disciples
                  was
                  made
                  the Bishop of that Church, <hi>Peter,</hi> and
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and many other of the
                  Apostles,
                  being
                  then alive, and all concurring
                  in this choice, and consenting
                  to it. <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                
                as he tells
                  the story, makes
                  it a very solemn business, scarce such another Precedent
                  to be found in all antiquity. And he
                  relates
                  it thus, as followeth,
                   c. After the Martyrdom of
                  <hi>James,</hi> and the taking
                  of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  (by the <hi>Romans</hi>)
                  it is
                  affirmed
                  that the Apostles
                  and Disciples
                  of our Lord and Saviour which were
                  yet alive, together with those of the
                  Lords
                  kindred after the flesh, many of
                  whom
                  continued
                  living
                  till that time, resorted
                  thither. Their business was
                  to enter into consultation, ,
                  whom
                  they should find most worthy to succeed in the place of
                  <hi>James;</hi> and having
                  well considered
                  of it, they all with one accord, ,
                  saith
                  the Author, agreed
                  on <hi>Simeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> one of
                  our Saviours
                  kindred also, as fit and worthy to possess the Episcopal
                  Throne,
                
                and look unto the government of that Church or
                  Diocess.
                  So that in this election there did
                  not only meet together the Lords
                  kindred, who might perhaps desire to keep that holy
                  honour in their own family; not the
                  Disciples
                  only of the lower rank, who might perhaps be
                  easily
                  induced
                  to consent thereto, to gratifie
                  the kindred of their Lord and Master: But there
                  met
                  also the Apostles,
                  men
                  guided
                  and directed
                  by the Spirit of God; and all of these
                  coming
                  from several parts
                  and countries
                  did,
                  , with one accord, with one
                  unanimous assent, agree upon the choice of this worthy
                  man, to be the Bishop or chief Pastor of the mother
                  City, which place he held
                  until the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> during whose Empire
                  he received
                  the Crown of Martyrdom,
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 109.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here then we have two Bishops
                  of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                made
                  by the general and joynt
                  consent of
                  the Apostles;
                  and those two Bishops
                  not in name and title, but in power and office,
                  according
                  to the Ecclesiastical notion of the word, and as the
                  same is
                  taken
                  in the writings
                  of the Fathers
                  before alledged.
                  I know the word <hi>Episcopus,</hi> in the primitive and
                  proper notion doth signifie
                  a <hi>Supervisor</hi> or <hi>Overseer,</hi> as it
                  is
                  rendred
                  in our last Translation, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.4.
                
                Such were
                  the Officers
                  of the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                  whom
                  <hi>Suidas</hi> speaks
                  of, sent
                  by that State to look into the Government of the
                  Cities
                  under their dominion,
                  . And these,
                  saith
                  he, were
                  called
                  Bishops
                  and Guardians.
                  In this last sense the word is
                  often used
                  by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                
                as where he calleth
                  <hi>Numa,</hi> , The Bishop or
                  Guardian of the Vestal Virgins;
                  and their God <hi>Terminus,</hi> ,
                  the Overseer and preserver of peace and amity. Thus do
                  we read in <hi>Sophocles</hi> of certain
                  Officers
                  called
                  , such as took
                  care about the dead; of others in the civil
                  Laws,
                  <hi>qui pani,</hi>
                
                <hi> caeteris rebus venalibus praesunt,</hi> which
                  had
                  the oversight of the markets,
                  and those called
                  <hi>Episcopi.</hi> And thus doth <hi>Tully</hi> tell us
                  of himself,
                
                <hi>Vult me Pompeius episcopum esse,</hi> c. that
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> had
                  made
                  him
                  the Overseer or the Guardian of <hi>Campania,</hi> and
                  the whole Sea-coast. This being
                  the meaning
                  of the word in its
                  native sense, it pleased
                  the Holy Ghost to make choice thereof, to
                  signifie
                  the Pastor or Superiour
                  Minister, to whom
                  the governance of the Church was
                  trusted;
                  one who was
                  vested
                  with a constant and fixed
                  preheminence,
                  as well over the Clergy as the Laity,
                  committed
                  to his charge; such as both <hi>Timothy</hi> and
                  <hi>Titus</hi> are described
                  to be in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,
                
                of whom
                  we shall say more hereafter. S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  rightly
                  understood
                  the word, and the original of it, when he
                  told
                  us this, <hi>Graecum est enim, atque inde ductum
                  vocabulum, quod ille qui praeficitur, eis quibus
                  praeficitur superintendit,</hi> c. The word,
                  saith
                  he, is
                  <hi>Greek</hi> originally,
                  and from thence derived,
                  shewing
                  that he which is
                  preferred,
                  or set over others, is
                  bound
                  to take the oversight and care of those
                  whom
                  he is
                  set over. And so proceeding
                  unto the Etymology, or Grammar of the word, he
                  concludes
                  it thus, <hi>ut intelligat se non esse Episcopum, qui
                  praeesse dilexerit, non prodesse,</hi> that he
                  deserves
                  not to be called
                  a Bishop, which seeketh
                  rather to prefer himself, than to profit others. Saint
                  <hi>Austin</hi> being
                  himself a Bishop, knew
                  well the meaning
                  of the word, according
                  to the Ecclesiastical notion and sense thereof. And in
                  that notion, the Scriptures
                  generally,
                  and all the Fathers
                  universally
                  have used
                  the same; out of which word <hi>Episcopus</hi> (whether
                  <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi>)
                  the <hi>Germans</hi>
                  had
                  their <hi>Bischop,</hi>
                  and we thence our <hi>Bishop.</hi> If
                  sometimes
                  in the holy Scripture, the word be
                  used
                  to signifie
                  an
                  ordinary Presbyter, it is
                  at such times,
                  and such places
                  only, when as the Presbyters
                  had
                  the chief governance
                  of the Flocks,
                  next and immediately
                  under the Apostles,
                  and where there was
                  no <hi>Bishop,</hi> properly
                  so called,
                  established
                  over them,
                  as we shall see hereafter in the
                  Churches
                  of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> plantation.
              </p>
              
              
              
              <p>
                Having
                  thus seen
                  the sudden,
                
                and miraculous growth of the Church of God, in, and
                  about the City of <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                  and seen
                  the same confirmed
                  and setled
                  in Episcopal
                  government: our next enquiry must be
                  made
                  into the Clergy, which were
                  to be subordinate to him,
                  and to participate of the charge to
                  him
                  entrusted,
                  according
                  to his directions.
                  And in this search, we first encounter with the
                  Presbyters,
                  the first, as well in time, as they are in dignity. The
                  Deacon, though exceeding
                  ancient, yet comes
                  short in both. We shewed
                  you in the former Chapter, how our Redeemer
                  having
                  chosen
                  the Twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  appointed
                  <hi>other Seventy</hi> also, and
                  <hi>sent
                  them
                  two and two before him,</hi>
                
                <hi>to prepare his way.</hi> Of these the Lord
                  made
                  choice of some to be Evangelists,
                  and others to be Prophets,
                  some to be Pastors,
                  and Teachers,
                  and others to be helps
                  in Government, according
                  to the measure, and the purpose of his grace
                  bestowed
                  upon them,
                  in the effusion of his Spirit. And out of these thus
                  fitted
                  and prepared
                  for the work of God, I doubt not but there
                  were
                  some chosen
                  to assist S. <hi>James,</hi> in the discharge of the
                  great trust committed
                  to him,
                  by the common Counsel, and consent of the
                  <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  Such as were
                  after added
                  unto them,
                  according
                  to the exigences
                  of that Church. I take it to be all of Saint
                  <hi>James</hi> ordaining:
                  who being
                  a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Apostle,</hi>
                  is
                  not to be denied
                  the priviledg
                  of ordaining
                  Presbyters,
                  it being
                  a thing which both the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
                  did
                  do in all the Churches
                  which he planted,
                  and all succeeding
                  Bishops
                  since have done
                  in their several Dioceses.
                  Certain it is,
                  that there were
                  Presbyters
                  in the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  before the election of the Seven:
                
                <hi>Ignatius</hi> telling
                  us that <hi>Stephen</hi> did
                  minister, , <hi>c.</hi> to
                  <hi>James,</hi> and to the Presbyters,
                  which were
                  in <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  And certain also it is,
                  that the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  first, and <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  afterwards
                  ordained
                  Presbyters,
                  to be assistant with them,
                  and subservient to them,
                  in their several charges:
                  and this they did,
                  according
                  as the Fathers
                  say, in imitation of our Lord and Saviour; who
                  having
                  chose
                  his <hi>twelve Apostles,</hi>
                
                appointed
                  <hi>Seventy others</hi> of a lower rank,
                  <hi>Seciendos
                  Christi Discipulos,</hi> as S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  calls
                  them.
                  Not that the Presbyters
                  of the Church do succeed the <hi>Seventy,</hi> who
                  were
                  not founded
                  in a perpetuity by our Saviour
                  Christ,
                
                as the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi>
                  hath
                  well observed:
                  but only that they had
                  a resemblance to them,
                  and were
                  ordained
                  , as the Council of
                  <hi>Neo-Caesarea</hi> affirmed
                  before, as secondary and subservient
                  Ministers
                  in the Church of God, And this is
                  that which <hi>Beda</hi> tells
                  us in his Comment on the Gospel of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
                
                that as the Twelve <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  did
                  premonstrate the Form of Bishops,
                  so the Presbyters
                  did
                  bear the figure of the <hi>Seventy.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Another resemblance between the
                  Presbyters
                  and the <hi>Seventy</hi> may perhaps be this,
                
                that as our Saviour in the choicing
                  of these Disciples
                  related
                  to the number of the Elders
                  in the state of <hi>Jewry:</hi> so the
                  <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  thought it fit to give unto the
                  Ministers
                  thus by them
                  ordained
                  (though they regarded
                  not the number) the name of Elders,
                  according
                  to the custom of that State before.
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  they are called
                  in the <hi>Greek</hi> originals,
                  which being
                  often rendred
                  <hi>Seniores</hi> in the vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi>
                  occasioned
                  that our first Translators
                  (who perhaps looked
                  no farther than the <hi>Latin</hi>)
                  turned
                  it into Elders:
                  though I could heartily
                  have wished
                  they had
                  retained
                  the name of <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  as the more proper, and specifical word of the two, by
                  far. But for these Presbyters
                  of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  (from whencesoever they may borrow or derive their name)
                  we find thrice mention of them
                  in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  during the time Saint <hi>James</hi>
                  was
                  Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 11.15.21. In the first
                  place we read, that when the Disciples
                  which dwelt
                  at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                
                had
                  made
                  a contribution for the brethren of <hi>Judaea,</hi> they
                  sent
                  it to the Elders
                  there by the hands
                  of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> Ask
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> who these Elders
                  were,
                  and he will tell you , that they
                  were
                  the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  And like enough it is,
                  that the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  may be comprehended
                  in that general name;
                
                they being
                  indeed the elder brethren. Ask <hi>Calvin</hi> why this
                  contribution was
                  sent
                  unto the Presbyters
                  or Elders,
                  being
                  there were
                  particular Officers
                  appointed
                  to attend the poor, as is
                  set down in the 6. Chapter of the
                  <hi>Acts;</hi>
                  and he will tell you, that the Deacons
                  were
                  so appointed
                  over that business, that notwithstanding they
                  were
                  still inferiour
                  unto the Presbyters;
                  <hi>nec quicquam sine eorum auctoritate agerent,</hi>
                
                and were
                  not to do any thing therein
                  without their authority. So for that passage in the 21.
                  S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates
                  how <hi>Paul,</hi> at his last going
                  to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  went
                  in unto <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>that all the
                  Elders
                  were
                  present;</hi> and adds
                  withal, what counsel and advice they
                  gave
                  him,
                  for his ingratiating
                  with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  Here find we <hi>James</hi> the Bishop
                  attended
                  by his Presbyters,
                  at the reception of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi>
                
                and they together joyning
                  with him
                  in the consultation then in hand, the business
                  being
                  great and weighty. And therefore <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                  observes,
                
                
                 that <hi>James</hi>
                  determined
                  nothing in it, as a Bishop, of his sole authority: but
                  took
                  <hi>Paul</hi> into counsel with
                  him:
                  and that the Presbyters
                  on the other side, carried
                  themselves with great respect and reverence
                  towards
                  him,
                  [] giving
                  him
                  an
                  account, or reason of their following
                  counsel. The Bishop never fist in a
                  firmer
                  Chair, than when his Chapter doth support it.
              </p>
              <p>
                But that which is
                  indeed the matter of the greatest
                  moment,
                
                is
                  that which occurs
                  in the 15. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  touching
                  the Council of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi>
                  wherein the Presbyters
                  are so often mentioned,
                  as if without their presence and assistance, the
                  <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  had
                  been
                  able to determine nothing. Some would fain have it so
                  perhaps, but it will not be, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  was
                  so assured
                  of the Doctrine by him
                  delivered,
                  as not to put it to the trial of a mortal man: and the
                  <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  of a spirit so infallible in the
                  things
                  of God, as not to need the counsel and assistance of
                  inferiour
                  persons.
                  How many points
                  of Doctrine did
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> determine without
                  repairing
                  to the <hi>Apostles?</hi>
                  How many did
                  the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  preach and publish without
                  consulting
                  with the Presbyters?
                  Somwhat
                  there must be in it more than ordinary,
                  which did
                  occasion this conjuncture; and is
                  briefly
                  this. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  which had
                  but newly
                  been
                  initiated
                  in the faith of Christ, and were
                  yet very zealous of their ancient
                  Ceremonies,
                  came
                  from <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  to <hi>Antiochia;</hi>
                
                and there delivered
                  Doctrines
                  contrary unto those which <hi>Paul</hi>
                  taught
                  before. It seems
                  there were
                  some Presbyters
                  amongst them,
                  for it is
                  said,
                  they taught
                  the people: and they pretended
                  too, that they did
                  teach no other Doctrine, than that which
                  had
                  been
                  authorized
                  by the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  The Doctrine was,
                  that <hi>except men
                  would be circumcised
                  after the manner
                  of</hi> Moses,
                  <hi>they could not be saved.
                  Paul</hi> might have over-ruled
                  this case, by his own authority. But partly for the
                  satisfaction of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi>
                  and partly for the full conviction of these false
                  Teachers,
                  he was
                  content, by Revelation of the Spirit,
                
                to put the matter over to the resolution of such of the
                  <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  as were
                  then abiding
                  in <hi>Hierusalem:</hi>
                  that by their general attestation, they might confirm
                  his doctrine to be sound, and true. As for the
                  Presbyters
                  it concerned
                  them
                  to be present also, as well to clear themselves from
                  authorizing
                  any such <hi>false brethren</hi> to disturb the Church,
                  as to prevent the like disorders
                  in the time to come. This is
                  the sum of the proceedings
                  in this business. And this doth no way interest the
                  Presbyters
                  in the determination of points
                  of faith, further than as they are
                  concerned
                  either in having
                  been
                  a means
                  to pervert the same; or for the
                  clearing
                  of themselves from the like suspicions.
                  And yet I cannot but affirm withal, that pure and
                  primitive antiquity
                  did
                  derive from hence the Form, and manner of their
                  Councils:
                  in which the Presbyters
                  did
                  oftentimes
                  concur, both for voice and hand, I mean as well in
                  giving
                  of their suffrages,
                  as the subscription of their names.
                
                Certain I am
                  that in the Council held
                  in <hi>Arragon, Anno</hi> 490. or
                  thereabouts,
                  it was
                  provided
                  among other things,
                  <hi>ut non solum  Cathedralibus, verum etiam de
                  Diocesanis:</hi> that certain Presbyters
                  should be chosen,
                  as well out of the <hi>Diocesan,</hi> as the Cathedral
                  Churches,
                  to attend that service; and that the Metropolitan should
                  send out his Letters
                  unto that effect: according
                  as is
                  still observed
                  in holding
                  of the Convocation of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Next to the constituting
                  of the Presbyters
                  in time and order,
                
                was
                  the election of the Seven; and this the
                  <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  did
                  put over to the people only: not
                  intermedling
                  in the same at all, further than in
                  commending
                  them
                  to the grace of God, that they might
                  faithfully
                  discharge the trust committed
                  to them.
                  The Church was
                  then in that condition, that the
                  Disciples
                  lived
                  in one place together, and <hi>had
                  all things
                  common:</hi> some of them
                  selling
                  their Estates,
                
                and <hi>laying
                  down the price thereof at the Apostles
                  feet,</hi>
                  that by them
                  it might be distributed
                  as occasion
                  was.
                  But being
                  it fell out, that some did
                  think themselves neglected
                  in the distribution, the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                  both to free themselves of so great a trouble,
                
                as also to avoid suspicion of being
                  partial in the business, required
                  them
                  to make choice of such trusty men,
                  as they conceived
                  most fit to be the Stewards
                  of their goods,
                
                and the dispensers
                  of the common stock. This was
                  the charge the <hi>Seven</hi> were
                  called
                  to by the people: which being
                  no Ecclesiastical function, but a Civil trust; no
                  dispensation of the Word and Sacraments,
                  but a dispository power of the common
                  Treasure: it was
                  most consonant to the Rules
                  of Reason, that the election of
                  them
                  should be left to the people only. I know these Seven
                  are commonly
                  both called,
                  and accounted
                  Deacons:
                  but I find no such thing in the
                  Texts,
                  or story.
                
                
                
                Neither in that Chapter, nor in all the
                  <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  is
                  the word <hi>Deacon</hi> to be found: nor find I either
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi> (of
                  whom
                  the Scripture is
                  most copious) to be so entituled.
                
                <hi>Philip</hi> indeed is
                  called
                  <hi>unus de septem,</hi> but no more, <hi>one of the
                  Seven,</hi> but no such stile as <hi>Deacon</hi>
                  added:
                  which makes
                  me think their Office was
                  not such as it is
                  conceived.
                  And this I am
                  the rather induced
                  to think, because I find Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                
                and others of the same opinion. Saint
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> putting
                  it unto the question, what dignity or Office these
                  men
                  had,
                  what Ordination they received,
                  and namely, whether that of <hi>Deacons;</hi>
                  makes
                  answer first, that in his time the use
                  was
                  otherwise, the Presbyters
                  being
                  there intrusted
                  with the distribution
                  of the Churches
                  Treasure, and then concludeth,
                  , that it appeared
                  not in his opinion, that they were
                  either
                  Presbyters,
                  or Deacons.
                  The Fathers
                  of the sixth Council in <hi>Constantinople</hi> building
                  upon those words
                  of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                
                do affirm the same; determining
                  expresly
                  that those <hi>Seven</hi> mentioned
                  in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  were
                  not ordained
                  to any ministration at the Lords
                  Table, , but only to the service and
                  attendance of the Common Tables.
                
                In which regard Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  looking
                  back unto the Primitive institution, doth call the
                  <hi>Deacons</hi>
                  of his time, <hi>mensarum  viduarum Ministros,</hi>
                  in his Epistle to <hi>Euagrius.</hi>
                  For howsoever I believe not, on my former ground, that
                  the <hi>Seven</hi> spoken
                  of in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  had
                  either the Office
                  or the name of <hi>Deacons,</hi>
                  as it was
                  used
                  afterwards
                  in the Church of God: yet I deny not but the Church
                  took
                  some hint from hence, even in the
                  times
                  of the Apostles,
                  to institute that holy Order, and to appoint it to some
                  special ministery
                  in Gods
                  publick
                  service: as doth appear both by the
                  Epistles
                  of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the
                  Records
                  of Primitive and pure antiquity. That <hi>Philip</hi>
                  did
                  both preach the Gospel, and baptize
                  the Converts,
                  or that <hi>Stephen</hi> did
                  both preach the Gospel, and convince the adversary:
                  related
                  not to any power or faculty which they
                  received
                  by the addition or access of this new Office. For
                  being
                  they, and all the residue were
                  of the <hi>Seventy,</hi>
                
                as the Fathers
                  say: and that they had
                  received
                  the Holy Ghost before, as the Scriptures
                  tell us: their preaching
                  and baptizing,
                  must relate to their former Calling.
                  And it had
                  been
                  a degradation from their former
                  dignity, being
                  Presbyters
                  at the least before, to be made
                  <hi>Deacons</hi>
                  now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus have we seen
                  the instituting
                  of the several Orders
                  of Bishops,
                
                Presbyters,
                  and Deacons,
                  in the holy <hi>Hierarchie:</hi>
                  according
                  to those several names,
                  which were
                  in tract of time appropriated
                  to their several functions
                  in the Church of God. And certainly
                  it did
                  require some space of time, to estrange
                  words
                  from their natural to a borrowed
                  sense, to bring them
                  to an
                  Ecclesiastical, from a Civil notion. So that it
                  is
                  no wonder, if at first the names
                  and appellations
                  of these several functions
                  were
                  used
                  promiscuously,
                  before that time had
                  limited
                  and restrained
                  them
                  to that express and setled
                  signification which they still retain. That glorious
                  name of an
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> which of it self
                  did
                  signifie
                  a <hi>Messenger,</hi> (<hi>Graec
                  Apostoli,</hi>
                
                <hi>Latin Missi appellantur,</hi> as Saint
                  <hi>Austin</hi> hath
                  it) was
                  given
                  by Christ as a peculiar
                  name to his twelve Disciples.
                  And yet we find it sometimes
                  given
                  to inferiour
                  persons,
                
                as to <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junias,</hi> in the
                  16. Chap. to the <hi>Romans:</hi>
                  sometimes
                  reverting
                  to its
                  primitive and ancient use, as where the
                  Messengers
                  of the Churches
                  are called
                  <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                
                as in the 2. to those of Corinth, <hi>Apostoli
                  Ecclesiarum gloria Christi,</hi>
                  the Messengers
                  of the Churches
                  are the glory of Christ. So was
                  it also with that reverend and venerable Title of
                  <hi>Episcopus,</hi> borrowed
                  and restrained
                  from its
                  general use, to signifie
                  an
                  <hi>Overseer</hi> in the Church of God: one who
                  was
                  trusted
                  with the Government,
                  and superintendency of the flock of Christ
                  committed
                  to him:
                  according
                  to the acceptation of the word in the most ancient
                  Authors
                  of the Christian Church.
                
                And yet sometimes
                  we find it given
                  unto the Presbyters,
                  as in the first of the <hi>Philippians</hi>
                  in which <hi>Paul</hi> writing
                  to the Bishops
                  and Deacons,
                  is
                  thought by Bishops
                  to mean Presbyters;
                  partly because the Presbyters
                  had
                  then the government of that Church under the
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> and partly because it
                  was
                  against the ancient Apostolical constitution, that there
                  should be many <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  (properly
                  so called)
                  in one City. Thus also, for the Title
                  <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which by the Church
                  was
                  used
                  to signifie,
                  not as before, an
                  ancient Man, which is
                  the native
                  sense,
                
                and construction of it; but one in <hi>holy
                  Orders,</hi>
                  such as in after times
                  were
                  called
                  by the name of <hi>Priests:</hi>
                  it grew
                  so general for a while, as to include both
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  and <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  also; as <hi>Beza</hi> notes
                  upon the first Epistle of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap. 5.
                  And that perhaps upon the reason
                  given
                  by <hi>Ambrose, Omnis Episcopus Presbyter, non
                
                
                tamen omnis Presbyter Episcopus,</hi> because that every
                  Bishop was
                  Presbyter, although not every Presbyter a Bishop. And
                  yet sometimes
                  we find in Scripture, that it returned
                  unto its
                  primitive, and original use: as in the first to
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> Cap. 5. v. 1. in which
                  , is
                  used
                  to signifie
                  an
                  ancient Man. ,
                  an
                  ancient Woman, as by the Text and context doth at full
                  appear. The like occurreth
                  sometimes
                  also in the ancient Writers.
                  Last of all, for the word <hi>Diaconus,</hi> which in it
                  self doth signifie
                  any common Minister, or domestick
                  servant, the Church made
                  use thereof to denote such Men,
                  as served
                  in the inferiour
                  ministeries
                  of the Congregation;
                  such as according
                  to the Ecclesiastical notion of the word we now call
                  <hi>Deacons,</hi>
                  as in the first of the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  and in the ancient Writers
                  <hi>passim.</hi>
                
                Yet did
                  it not so easily
                  put off its
                  original nature, but that it did
                  sometimes
                  revert to it again: as in the 13. of the
                  <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  in which the Magistrate is
                  called
                  <hi>Diaconus,</hi>
                
                being
                  the publick
                  Minister of Justice under God Almighty;
                
                and <hi>Phoebe</hi> in the 16. of the same Epistle,
                  is
                  called
                  , a servant of the Church of
                  <hi>Cenchrea.</hi> Indeed the marvel
                  is
                  not much that it should be so long before the Church
                  could fasten and appropriate
                  these particular names
                  to the particular Officers
                  of, and in the same; considering
                  how long it was
                  before she got
                  a name unto her self. The word ,
                  which is
                  used
                  in Scripture to denote the Church, doth
                  signifie
                  amongst the ancient learned
                  Writers,
                  a meeting
                  or assembly
                  of the people for their common business: as
                  . Not to omit the
                  <hi>Thracians</hi>
                  to the common Council.
                
                So in <hi>Aristophanes.</hi> The like we find also in
                  <hi>Thucydides,</hi> , that
                  having
                  constituted
                  the Assembly,
                  they fell upon their altercations.
                  The first time that we find it used
                  to denote the Church, is
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. and after
                  frequently
                  in holy Scripture: yet so, that it
                  returned
                  sometimes
                  to its
                  native sense, as in the 19. of the
                  <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  wherein we read, , that the
                  assembly
                  (of the <hi>Ephesians</hi>)
                  was
                  confused,
                  <hi>ver.</hi>
                  32. and , he
                  dismissed
                  the assembly,
                  <hi>ver.</hi>
                  41. And therefore they which from identity of
                  names
                  in holy Scripture, conclude identity of
                  Offices
                  in the Church of Christ; and will have
                  <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Episcopus</hi> to be both
                  one Calling,
                  because the names
                  are sometimes
                  used
                  promiscuously
                  in the first beginnings:
                  may with like equity
                  conclude that every <hi>Deacon</hi>
                  is
                  a Magistrate, and every <hi>Presbyter</hi>
                  an
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> or that the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
                  was
                  nothing else than an
                  assembly
                  of the Citizens
                  in the Town-Hall there, for the dispatch of business
                  which concerned
                  the Corporation.

                OY ,
                
                It is
                  the observation of Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> that the
                  Church never thriveth
                  better than in persecutions.
                
                And this he speaks,
                  on the dispersion of the Disciples
                  after the martyrdom of <hi>Stephen:</hi> than which
                  there could not any thing fall out more
                  fortunately,
                  for the advancement
                
                
                
                of the Gospel.
                
                <hi>They which were
                  scattered
                  abroad</hi> (saith
                  the holy Text) <hi>upon the persecution
                  which arose about</hi> Stephen,
                  <hi>travelled
                  as far as</hi> Phoenice, <hi>and</hi> Cyprus,
                  <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>preaching
                  the Word to none but the Jews
                  only.</hi> At first indeed to none but the
                  Jews
                  alone. The Vision had
                  not yet appeared
                  to <hi>Peter,</hi> to Authorize
                  his going
                  in unto the Gentiles;
                  nor had
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houshold
                  as yet been
                  made
                  partakers
                  of the Holy Ghost. The Jews
                  were
                  they to whom
                  the promises
                  of God had
                  first been
                  made,
                  who as they were
                  dispersed
                  into many places;
                  so did
                  Gods
                  Word go after them,
                  and found them
                  out, either converting
                  them
                  unto the Faith, or else convincing
                  them
                  of their incredulity.
                  But in no City of the East, were
                  they so thick set, as in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> the
                  regal seat
                  and City of the Kings
                  of <hi>Syria;</hi>
                
                in which by ancient priviledge
                  first granted
                  by <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> they
                  were
                  all free Denizens,
                  and enjoyed
                  all immunities
                  whatsoever
                  with the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                  and <hi>Macedons.</hi>
                
                This made
                  them
                  plant here in great multitudes,
                  together with their Wives
                  and Children,
                  and so by consequence the greater
                  opportunity was
                  offered
                  for the enlargement of the Church.
                  News
                  hereof being
                  brought
                  unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  and Peace by that time being
                  setled
                  throughout the Churches,
                  S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                
                as he passed
                  throughout all quarters,
                  is
                  said
                  to have come down unto <hi>Antioch</hi> also, and to
                  have undertaken
                  the charge thereof, as being
                  the most famous City of the Eastern
                  parts.
                  It's true, the Scriptures
                  tell us nothing of this, but the
                  Fathers
                  do, and negative proofs
                  from Scripture,
                
                in a point of History, are of no Authority.
                  <hi>Origen</hi> calls
                  <hi>Ignatius, Episcopum Antiochiae post Petrum
                  secundum,</hi> the second that was
                  Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> after <hi>Peter;</hi> and
                  therefore <hi>Peter</hi> must of necessary consequence
                  be first Bishop there.
                
                <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith
                  the same with <hi>Origen,</hi> as to S.
                  <hi>Peters</hi>
                  being
                  Bishop there, and so doth <hi>Felix</hi> Pope of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> in the fifth Council of
                  <hi>Constantinople, Actione
                  prima.</hi> But not to trust to
                  consequences
                  only,
                
                though those clear enough; <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his
                  <hi>Chronicon</hi> saith
                  expresly,
                  <hi>Petrus Apostolus Ecclesiam Antiochenam fundavit,
                  ibique Cathedram adeptus
                  sedit,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle
                  founded
                  the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and sate Bishop there.
                  S. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth affirm the same,
                
                <hi>Primum Episcopum Antiochenae Ecclesiae Petrum
                  fuisse,</hi> and makes
                  it one of those things
                  which S. <hi>Luke</hi> omitted.
                  <hi>Luke</hi> being
                  an
                  attendant of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his
                  peregrinations,
                  took
                  not such special and particular notice of S.
                  <hi>Peters</hi>
                  actions;
                
                and therefore his omission of it
                  is
                  no argument that it was
                  not so. More of S. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  being
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> see in the
                  same S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Book <hi>de Ecclesiast.

                  Epistles,

                  is
                  said
                  to have continued
                  Bishop there seven years;
                  as indeed most Authors
                  do agree.

              <p>
                This founding
                  of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                
                and his assuming
                  of the Bishoprick
                  or charge thereof,
                
                is
                  by <hi>Eusebius</hi> placed
                  in the fourth year of the 203 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which
                  falleth
                  by computation into that 38 year of Christs Nativity,
                  being
                  the fourth year after his Ascension. But then withal, we
                  must restrain S. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  Bishoprick
                  in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and his foundation of that Church,
                  only unto the Jewish Congregations
                  there. Preaching
                  unto the Gentiles,
                  was
                  not yet thought lawful. And when it
                  was,
                  it pleased
                  God to make choice of others to promote that work.
                  Whereof when tidings
                  came
                  unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                <hi>they sent
                  forth</hi> Barnabas <hi>that he should go as far as</hi>
                  Antioch:
                  And when he found the task too great for himself alone,
                  he went
                  to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> saith
                  the Text, to seek for <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  whom
                  he brought
                  with him
                  to that City. By these the gaining
                  of the Gentiles
                  in that famous City was
                  begun
                  and finished.
                  In this regard
                  S. <hi>Paul</hi> is
                  to be reckoned
                  a co-founder at the least of the Church of
                  <hi>Antioch;</hi> and so <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth account
                  them
                  in his Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi>
                
                where he relateth
                  that the Disciples
                  were
                  first called
                  Christians
                  at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> , the Church
                  whereof was
                  founded
                  by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> And this may serve
                  to reconcile the difference which doth occur amongst the
                  ancient Writers
                  about S. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  next Successor in the See of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                
                <hi>Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret,</hi> and
                  <hi>Felix,</hi> whom
                  before we spake
                  of, do make <hi>Ignatius</hi> to be S.
                  <hi>Peters</hi>
                  next Successor; where by the way we have S.
                  <hi>Peters</hi>
                  being
                  Bishop there, avowed
                  by <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> into the
                  bargain.
                
                And on the other side, <hi>Eusebius</hi> and S.
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> place <hi>Euodius</hi>
                  first, and after his decease, <hi>Ignatius;</hi> wherein
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth himself concur with
                  them,
                  counselling
                  or exhorting
                  the <hi>Antiochians,</hi>
                  to call to mind <hi>Euodius</hi>
                  that most holy Bishop, , who first
                  received
                  the government of that Church from the holy
                  Apostles.
                  Now for the reconciliation of this difference,
                  taking
                  it first for granted,
                  as I think we may, that at first there
                  were
                  in <hi>Antiochia</hi> two several
                  Congregations
                  of converted
                  <hi>Christians,</hi>
                  the one of <hi>Jews,</hi>
                
                the other of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  were
                  the several
                  heads;
                  the Author of the <hi>Constitutions</hi>
                  ascribed
                  to <hi>Clemens</hi> (who in a matter of
                
                
                this nature may well be credited)
                  will give us an
                  handsom
                  hint, informing
                  us that (the Apostles
                  being
                  to betake themselves to their other business, or the
                  business rather of the Lord) S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  did
                  ordain <hi>Euodius,</hi>
                  and S. <hi>Paul, Ignatius,</hi> to be the
                  Bishops
                  there in their several charges.
                  Upon which ground <hi>Baronius</hi> doth infer, and not
                  improbably,
                  that the wall of separation being
                  beaten
                  down, and both the Congregations
                  of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> made
                  into one Church,
                
                <hi>Ignatius</hi> did
                  willingly
                  resign his present interest unto
                  <hi>Euodius,</hi>
                  whom
                  he succeeded
                  also after his decease. But be this how it will,
                  certain I
                  am
                  that the preferment of <hi>Euodius</hi>
                  to the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  is
                  placed
                  by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the 45. year of Christs
                  Nativity; who having
                  sate there six and twenty years,
                  did
                  leave the same unto <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Anno 71. S.
                  <hi>John,</hi> and perhaps other of the
                  Apostles
                  being
                  then alive. More than so, <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
                  affirms
                  expresly,
                
                not only that some of the Apostles
                  were
                  then alive, but that he was
                  made
                  Bishop by them,
                  , and that the
                  hands
                  of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  touched
                  his holy head. And so much for the
                  Bishops
                  of <hi>Antioohia,</hi> which lived
                  and were
                  co-temporary with the Apostles.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to go forwards
                  with S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                
                having
                  thus setled
                  and confirmed
                  the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and by this
                  Preaching
                  to <hi>Cornelius</hi> opened
                  a door unto the Gospel in <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and amongst
                  the Gentiles;
                  he followed
                  on the course of his Apostleship,
                  Preaching
                  unto the Jews
                  dispersed
                  in the Eastern parts,
                  as namely throughout <hi>Pontus,
                  Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
                  as himself intimates
                  in his first Epistle.
                
                And when he was
                  to leave those parts,
                  and make for <hi>Italy,</hi> he left
                  them
                  not without a Ministery;
                  nor did
                  he leave that Ministery
                  without some Bishops
                  to govern and direct the Flock. The Roman Martyrology
                  doth reckon in these Churches
                  of S. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  founding,
                  <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the first fruits
                  of the Gentiles,
                
                <hi>Quem B. Petrus Episcopali honore sublimavit,</hi>
                  made
                  by him
                  Bishop of <hi>Caesarea. Metaphrastes,</hi>
                  if he may be credited,
                
                as in most things,
                  which do not tend to miracles,
                  I think he may, relateth
                  that S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his peregrination
                  did
                  ordain Bishops
                  in the Churches
                  of <hi>Sydon, Berytus,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> that
                  he made
                  <hi>Marson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> and
                  <hi>Prochorus</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and
                  finally,
                  that in the Provinces
                  of <hi>Pontus, Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
                  he did
                  not only plant Churches,
                  but he founded
                  Bishopricks.
                  But waving
                  these things
                  as I find them,
                  and the report of <hi>Agapetus</hi> in the fifth Council
                  of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that the first Bishop of
                  <hi>Bizantium</hi>
                  was
                  of <hi>Peters</hi>
                  founding,
                  though of unquestionable credit: Let us repair unto the
                  Scriptures.
                
                There find we the Apostles
                  stirring
                  up the Pastors
                  to have a care unto the Flock. <hi>The
                  Elders
                  which are amongst you I exhort, who
                  am
                  also an
                  Elder, and a witness of the sufferings
                  of Christ, Feed the Flock of God which
                  is
                  among you.</hi>
                
                Ask <hi>Oecumenius</hi> who these
                  Presbyters
                  or Elders
                  were,
                  and he will tell you they were
                  Bishops.
                  And then he gives
                  this reason of it, , that
                  Bishops
                  are called
                  Presbyters
                  in the book of <hi>Acts.</hi>
                  But <hi>Oecumenius</hi> being
                  of a later
                  standing,
                  may possibly
                  be undervalued
                  when he speaks
                  alone; and therefore we will <hi>stare super vias
                  antiquas,</hi> enquire
                  amongst the ancients,
                  and ask their judgments
                  in the case. And here we meet with <hi>Gregory
                  Nazianzen,</hi>
                
                who pencelling and describing
                  a perfect Prelate, makes
                  amongst others, this to be a special quality
                  belonging
                  to him,
                  , not to constrain their people to
                  the works
                  of piety by force and violence, but to allure
                  them
                  by persuasions.
                  For proof whereof, he instanceth
                  in this present Text, Feed the Flock of Christ which
                  is
                  among you, not by constraint, but
                  willingly,
                  of a ready mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                But this construction may be verified
                  from the Text it self,
                
                as well as from the Glosses
                  of the ancient Writers·
                  and that from three particular words
                  or phrases,
                  that occur therein. For first, Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  calling
                  himself their <hi>Fellow Presbyter,</hi>
                   in the Greek,
                  shews
                  plainly
                  that they were
                  not simple Presbyters,
                  which he thus exhorteth,
                  but Presbyters
                  invested
                  with some higher
                  dignity, such as had
                  some resemblance of the Apostolical function. In which
                  regard S. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle in his two last
                  Epistles,
                  calls
                  himself a Presbyter, the Elder, as our English
                  reads
                  it. Which word he used,
                  as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> hath
                  observed,
                
                either because he was
                  grown
                  aged
                  when he wrote
                  the same, , or
                  intimating
                  that he was
                  a Bishop, according
                  as the word Presbyter would bear in those former
                  times.
                  And why not thus, since <hi>Beza</hi> doth affirm on
                  those words
                  of Saint <hi>Peter, Generale esse nomen
                  Presbyteri,</hi>
                
                that the name of Presbyter was
                  very general; so general as it seems
                  by him,
                  <hi>ut etiam ipsi Apostoli hoc nomine
                  comprehendantur,</hi> that even the holy
                  Apostles
                  are comprised
                  therein. And therefore <hi>Beza</hi>
                  being
                  Judge, S. <hi>Peter</hi> may mean
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  here, though he calls
                  them
                  <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  And that he meaneth
                  Bishops,
                  may be also gathered
                
                
                
                from the word , <hi>Feed ye the
                  Flock which is
                  among you.</hi> , in the
                  <hi>Greek</hi> not signifying
                  to feed only, and no more than so; but such a
                  feeding
                  as implyeth
                  a rule or governance annexed
                  unto it, which is
                  the proper act of Bishops.
                  Inferiour
                  Presbyters
                  may , feed the particular Flock
                  committed
                  to them
                  by the word of Doctrine: The Bishop only may
                   so feed them
                  with the word of Doctrine, as that he also rule
                  them
                  with the rod of Discipline. In this respect as the
                  Apostle joyns
                  the Shepherd and the Bishop in a line together:
                
                So primitive Antiquity did
                  arm the Bishop with a <hi>Crozier</hi> or
                  <hi>Pastoral</hi> staff, to shew
                  the union of those Offices
                  in the self-same person. But hereof we shall speak more
                  fully
                  in another place: And indeed
                  need not speak more of it upon this occasion,
                  considering
                  that there is
                  another word behind in S. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  Text, which putteth
                  the matter out of question. <hi>Feed ye the Flock of God
                  which is
                  among you,</hi> saith
                  the Apostle, ,
                  saith
                  the Text, <hi>taking
                  the oversight thereof,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi>
                  reads
                  it, <hi>doing
                  the Office of a Bishop,</hi> as the word doth
                  signifie.
                
                The ordinary Presbyters
                  may be called
                  , or <hi>Seers</hi>
                  if you will, according
                  to the notion of that word, in the first of
                  <hi>Samuel;</hi> the Bishops
                  are , such as do over-see the
                  <hi>Seers.</hi>
                  So then the Presbyters
                  whom
                  S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks
                  of, being
                  such as might , and
                  , both feed and oversee, and govern;
                  it is
                  apparent they were
                  Bishops,
                  and not simple Presbyters.
              </p>
              <p>
                But in this point Saint <hi>Peter</hi> shall not go
                  alone;
                
                S. <hi>Paul</hi> will put in for a share, and keep
                  him
                  company; who writing
                  to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                  even to the very <hi>hebrews</hi>
                  of Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  Province,
                
                doth advise them
                  thus,  c. <hi>Obey
                  them
                  that have the rule over you, and submit your
                  selves,
                  for they watch for your souls,
                  as they that must give account,</hi>
                
                c. If you would know of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> who
                  these Rulers
                  are, he will tell you that they are the
                  Pastors
                  of the Church, whom
                  if you take away from the Flock of Christ,
                  , you utterly
                  destroy and lay waste the whole.
                
                Next ask <hi>Theophylact,</hi> than
                  whom
                  none ever better scanned
                  that Fathers
                  writings,
                  what he means
                  by Pastors,
                  and he will tell you, , that he
                  speaks
                  of Bishops.
                
                The very same saith
                  <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> noting
                  withal that , which we read
                  <hi>submit,</hi> doth signifie
                  , a very punctual and exact
                  obedience. But to go higher
                  yet than so, <hi>Ignatius</hi> the
                  Apostles
                  Scholler,
                  one that both knew
                  S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and conversed
                  with him,
                  will tell us that the Rulers.
                  or , which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here
                  speaketh
                  of, were
                  no other than Bishops.
                  For laying
                  down this exhortation to the <hi>Trallenses,</hi>
                   be subject to your Bishop, as unto
                  the Lord; he gives
                  the self-same reason of it, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here
                  doth, <hi>viz. Because he watcheth
                  for your souls,
                  as one that is
                  to render an
                  account to Almighty
                  God.</hi> The like we also find in the
                  Canons
                  commonly
                  ascribed
                  to the Apostles,
                  which questionless are very ancient; in which, the
                  obedience and conformity which is
                  there required
                  of the Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  to the directions
                  of their Bishop, is
                  grounded
                  on that very reason alledged
                  before. And for the word,  of Saint
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> it is
                  not such a stranger in the writings
                  of the elder times,
                  but that they use it for a Bishop; as may appear by that
                  of the Historian, where he calls
                  <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Bishop of the Church of
                  <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                
                the  of that Church;
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> writing,
                  as he saith,
                  not only to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                   but also unto <hi>Polycarpus</hi>
                  Bishop of the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where lest it may be thought that the preposition doth
                  add unto the nature of the word,
                
                we find the same Historian speaking
                  of the same <hi>Polycarpus</hi> in another place; where
                  he gives
                  notice of an
                  Epistle written
                  in the name of the Church of <hi>Smyrna;</hi>
                  , of which this <hi>Polycarpus</hi>
                  had
                  the Government, and a Bishop doubtless. In the which
                  place , is
                  conform most fully
                  to the  of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  differing
                  no otherwise than the <hi>verb</hi> and
                  <hi>participle.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now those which in the <hi>Greek</hi> are
                  called
                  ,
                
                in all the old Translations
                  that I have met
                  with, are called
                  <hi>Praepositi; Obedite Praepositis vestris,</hi> as the
                  <hi>Latines</hi>
                  read it; and amongst them
                  <hi>Praepositi</hi> are taken
                  generally
                  for the same with Bishops.
                
                S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thus, <hi>Ob hoc Ecclesiae
                  praepositum prosequitur;</hi> for this cause doth the
                  enemy pursue him
                  that is
                  set over the Church, that the Governour
                  thereof being
                  once removed,
                  he may with greater
                  violence destroy the same.
                
                More clearly
                  in another place, <hi>What danger
                  is
                  not to be feared,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>by offending
                  the Lord, when some of the Priests
                  not remembring
                  their place, neither thinking
                  that they have a Bishop set over
                  them,
                  challenge the whole government
                  unto themselves,</hi> Cum contumeli 
                  contemptu Praepositi, <hi>even with the reproach and
                  contempt of the Prelate,</hi>
                
                <hi>or him
                  that is
                  set over them?</hi>
                  Most clearly
                  yet, where speaking
                  of the insolency of a Deacon towards
                  his Bishop, he makes
                  <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Praepositus</hi> to
                
                
                be one same thing; willing the Deacon, <hi>Episcopo,
                  Praeposito suo plena humilitate
                  satisfacere,</hi>
                  with all humility to satisfie
                  his Bishop, or <hi>Praepositus.</hi> Saint
                  <hi>Austin</hi> speaks
                  as fully
                  to this purpose, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  did,
                  <hi>Ad hoc enim speculatores,</hi>
                
                i.e. <hi>populorum Praepositi
                  in Ecclesiis constituti sunt,</hi> c. <hi>For this
                  end are Bishops</hi>
                  (<hi>for</hi> speculatores <hi>and</hi>
                  Episcopi,
                  <hi>are the same Office, though in
                  divers
                  words</hi>)
                  <hi>I mean the</hi> Prelates
                  <hi>or</hi> Praepositi, <hi>ordained
                  in the Churches,
                  that they should not spare to rebuke sin.</hi> In the
                  same work <hi>De civitate,</hi>
                  he speaks
                  plainer
                  yet. For speaking
                  of these words
                  of the Divine, <hi>I saw
                  seats,</hi>
                
                <hi>and some sitting
                  on them,
                  and judgment
                  was
                  given,</hi>
                  he expounds
                  it thus. <hi>This is
                  not to be understood,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>of the last Judgment:</hi>
                  Sed sedes praepositorum,  ipsi Praepositi
                  intelligendi sunt, per quos Ecclesia nunc gubernatur,
                  <hi>but the seats
                  of the</hi> Praepositi, <hi>and the</hi> Praepositi
                  <hi>themselves, by whom
                  the Church is
                  now governed</hi>
                  (<hi>and they were
                  Bishops
                  doubtless in Saint</hi> Augustines <hi>time</hi>)
                  <hi>must be understood.</hi>
                  More of this word who list to see, may find it in that
                  learned
                  Tract of Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi>
                  entituled,
                
                <hi>The perpetual Government of Christs Church;</hi> who
                  is
                  copious in it. <hi>Beza</hi> indeed, the better to bear
                  off this blow, hath
                  turned
                  <hi>Praepositos</hi> into <hi>Ductores;</hi> and instead
                  of <hi>Governours,</hi>
                  hath
                  given
                  us <hi>Leaders.</hi>
                  Where if he mean such <hi>Leaders,</hi>
                  as the word importeth,
                  Leaders
                  of Armies,
                  such as Command in chief, Lieutenants
                  General, he will get little by the bargain. But if he
                  mean by Leaders,
                  only guides
                  and conducts,
                  <hi>Paraeus,</hi>
                
                though he follow him
                  in his Translation, will leave him
                  to himself in his Exposition: who by <hi>Ductores</hi>
                  understandeth
                  <hi>Ecclesiae Pastores
                   gubernatores,</hi> the Pastors
                  and Governours
                  of the Church. Neither can <hi>Beza</hi>
                  possibly
                  deny, but that those here are called
                  <hi>Ductores,</hi>
                
                <hi>qui alibi Episcopi vocantur,</hi> which elsewhere
                  are entituled
                  <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  But where he doth observe,
                  that because the Apostle speaketh
                  of <hi>Praepositi</hi> in the plural number,
                
                therefore Episcopal jurisdiction
                  was
                  not then in use; it being
                  indeed against the ancient course and
                  <hi>Canons,</hi>
                  to have two Bishops
                  in one Church: there could not any thing be
                  spoken,
                  (to pretermit the incivility of his expression) more
                  silly and unworthy of so great a Clerk. For who
                  knows
                  not that the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  being
                  dispersed
                  into many Provinces
                  and Cities,
                  must have several Churches;
                  and therefore several Bishops,
                  or <hi>Praepositos,</hi> to bear Rule over
                  them?
              </p>
              <p>
                This business being
                  thus passed
                  over,
                
                and the Churches
                  of Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  planting
                  in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts,
                  being
                  thus left unto the care and charge of several
                  Bishops:
                  we will next follow him
                  into the <hi>West.</hi> And there we find
                  him
                  taking
                  on himself
                  the care of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather, of
                  the Church of God in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  consisting
                  for the most part then of converted
                  <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  The current of antiquity runs
                  so clear this way, that he must
                  needs
                  corrupt the Fountains,
                  who undertakes
                  to trouble
                  or disturb the stream. His being
                  there, and founding
                  of that Church, his being
                  Bishop there, and suffering
                  there an
                  ignominious, yet a glorious death, for the sake of
                  Christ; are such noted
                  Truths,
                  that it were
                  labour lost
                  to insist upon them.
                  Only I shall direct the Reader to such pregnant
                  places
                  in the most ancient and incorrupted
                  Writers,
                  as may give satisfaction in those
                  points
                  to any one that will take pains
                  to look upon them.
                  And first to look upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                  he may find <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                  ancient Writers
                  both, alledged
                  to this purpose by <hi>Eusebius Hist.

                  of <hi>Corinth,</hi> both of good antiquity,
                  alledged
                  in the same book, cap. .
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaking
                  for himself, not only in the 13. Chap. of the same book
                  also, but also in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> in which he
                  notes
                  the year of his first coming
                  to that City, to be the 44. after Christs Nativity. See
                  to this purpose also, Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his
                  Homily <hi>De Petro  Paulo,</hi> Saint
                  <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Epistle to
                  Pope <hi>Celestine: Theodoret, Sozomen,</hi> and others.
                  Next for the <hi>Latins,</hi>
                  there is
                  hardly
                  any but saith

                  not to descend to later
                  Writers
                  of the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches,
                  whose interest it may seem to be. To close this point,
                  Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
                
                whom
                  I named
                  last, shall speak once for all, who
                  reckoning
                  up the Bishops
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thus
                  begins
                  his Catalogue: <hi>Si enim,</hi> c. <hi>If the
                  succession of the Bishops
                  there be a thing considerable,</hi> quanto certius,
                   ver salubriter ab ipso Petro numeramus?
                  <hi>how much more certainly,
                  and assuredly
                  do we begin the same with</hi> Peter, <hi>who bare the
                  figure of the whole Church?</hi> And then
                  goes
                  on, <hi>Petro successit Linus, Linus</hi>
                  succeeded
                  <hi>Peter, Clemens</hi>
                  him,
                  and so to <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who then
                  held
                  the See.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nor can it be replyed
                  that <hi>Peter</hi> took
                  the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into his Apostolical care,
                  and had
                  not the Episcopal charge thereof, as some now suppose.
                
                The Tables
                
                
                
                of succession make that clear enough. Saint
                  <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle could have no
                  successours,
                  but the Bishop might. <hi>Linus,</hi> or whosoever else
                  succeeded,
                  nor did,
                  nor could pretend succession to the
                  preheminences,
                  and miraculous priviledges,
                  which were
                  required
                  necessarily
                  unto the making
                  of an
                  Apostle, challenge an
                  interest by succession, in his Pastoral Office they both
                  might and did.
                  The Writers
                  of all ages
                  since do afford
                  them
                  that. Only the difference is
                  amongst them,
                  who was
                  the first that did
                  succeed
                  him
                  in his Pastoral charge. St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  gives
                  it unto <hi>Linus,</hi> as before we
                  saw:
                  next <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                
                and then <hi>Anacletus. Irenaeus</hi> doth agree with
                  <hi>Austin,</hi> placing
                  <hi>Linus</hi> first, but placing
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> second, and then <hi>Clemens</hi>
                  third: and so doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> also.
                  <hi>Optatus</hi> reckoneth
                  them,
                  as before in <hi>Austin.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  sometimes
                  ranketh
                  them,
                  as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  did,
                  <hi>Linus, Cletus, Clemens;</hi> and
                  sometimes
                  placeth
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> first, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and
                  <hi>plerique Latinorum,</hi> most of the ancient
                  <hi>Latin</hi> Writers
                  had
                  done
                  before. I know there is
                  much pains
                  taken
                  to compose this difference amongst
                  our Antiquaries,
                  those most especially
                  of the Papal party. But in my mind there cannot be a
                  better course taken
                  to effect the same, than that which
                  was
                  observed
                  before in the case of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And to effect
                  this composition, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and some other
                  Fathers
                  give a ground as probable, as that which
                  was
                  laid
                  down before in the former business.
                
                For first it is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  had
                  as great an
                  interest in the foundation of the Church of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  had,
                  <hi>A duobus Apostolis
                  Petro  Paulo Romae fundatae  constitutae
                  Ecclesiae:</hi> as his own words
                  are. The like saith
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in another language,
                
                making
                  both of them
                  Bishops
                  of that Church. Next it is
                  said
                  expresly
                  by <hi>Ignatins,</hi> who might well speak on certain
                  knowledg
                  living
                  in those times,
                  that <hi>Anacletus</hi> (for I conceive that
                  <hi>Cletus,</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi>
                  were
                  the same) was
                  Deacon to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> Deacon
                  to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth indeed make mention of
                  him
                  in his second Epistle unto <hi>Timothy.</hi> This ground
                  thus laid,
                  why may we not conceive, as before in <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  that in the first planting
                  of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there
                  were
                  two several Churches,
                  or congregations;
                  that of the <hi>Circumcision</hi>
                  being
                  collected
                  by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that of the
                  <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  first drawn
                  together by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> each of
                  them
                  being
                  Bishop, or chief Pastor of their
                  Congregations?
                  Secondly,
                  that when the two Apostles
                  perceived
                  the time of their sufferings
                  to draw near. <hi>Peter</hi> ordained
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> Bishop of the
                  Churches
                  of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi>
                  did
                  commit to <hi>Linus</hi> the government of the
                  Churches
                  of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi>
                  both whom
                  they had
                  employed
                  before as Deputies
                  and Substitutes
                  to attend these charges,
                  whilst they themselves
                  did
                  travel to and fro, as occasion was,
                  and the necessities
                  of the Church required.
                  Thirdly
                  and lastly,
                  that <hi>Linus</hi> being
                  dead, <hi>Clemens</hi> (who had
                  before been
                  specially
                  designed
                  by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to possess his place)
                  succeeded
                  Bishop of the Churches
                  of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  there, who finally
                  surviving
                  <hi>Cletus,</hi> or <hi>Anacletus,</hi> call
                  him
                  which you will, and the division between <hi>Jew</hi>
                  and <hi>Gentile</hi> being
                  worn
                  away, united
                  the two Churches
                  in his person, as the sole Bishop of the whole. And this
                  I am
                  the rather induced
                  to think, because that <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  making
                  up a Catalogue of the Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                first joyns
                  together <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> next
                  coupleth
                  with the like conjunction <hi>Linus</hi> and
                  <hi>Cletus:</hi> and after brings
                  in <hi>Clemens, Euaristus,
                  Alexander,</hi> c. in a line
                  successively.
                  And yet the Tables
                  of succession may well stand as they have
                  done
                  hitherto;
                  first <hi>Linus,</hi> after <hi>Cletus,</hi> and
                  thirdly
                  <hi>Clemens:</hi> because that <hi>Linus</hi>
                  dying
                  first, left <hi>Cletus</hi> in possession of the
                  Pastoral charge, and <hi>Cletus</hi>
                  dying
                  before <hi>Clemens,</hi> left him
                  the sole surviver of the three, which
                  possibly
                  may be the reason why many of the
                  <hi>Latins</hi>
                  reckon <hi>Clemens</hi> for the first Bishop after
                  <hi>Peter:</hi> whom
                  they conceive to be sole Bishop of that Church: as
                  indeed it was,
                  before there was
                  a Church of <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  founded
                  in that famous City. For being
                  formerly
                  designed
                  by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be his
                  Successour,
                  and afterward enjoying
                  the whole charge alone, as <hi>Peter</hi> for a season
                  did:
                  it might not seem improper to report
                  him
                  for the second Bishop; that is,
                  the second of the whole. And then again,
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> is
                  placed
                  by some next and immediately
                  after <hi>Linus,</hi> whose successor he
                  was
                  in the direct line, as Bishop of the more famous Church,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
                  and by some also after <hi>Cletus,</hi>
                  whom
                  he succeeded
                  at the last, in the line collateral. However, be this
                  so, or not, we have three Bishops
                  sitting
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> between the martyrdom of
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and the death of <hi>John:</hi> first,
                  <hi>Linus,</hi> who held
                  the same twelve years:
                  <hi>Cletus</hi> or <hi>Anacletus,</hi> who
                  survived,
                  and held
                  twelve years
                  more: and <hi>Clemens,</hi> finally,
                  who suffered
                  martyrdom at <hi>Rome,</hi> the next year after the
                  decease of Saint <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                I take it then for a most manifest and undoubted truth,
                
                not only that Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  was
                  at <hi>Rome,</hi> but that he also
                  took
                  upon him
                  the Episcopal charge, and was
                  the
                
                
                Bishop of that City. The Arguments
                  devised
                  in this later
                  Age to evince the contrary,
                  do nothing less in my opinion, than prove the point for
                  which they were
                  first devised.
                  For first it is
                  objected,
                  that the Episcopal charge requiring
                  residence, could not consist with that of
                  an
                  Apostle, who was
                  to be perpetually
                  in motion. Which argument, if it be of any force, will
                  militate as well against Saint <hi>James</hi> his
                  being
                  Bishop of <hi>Herusalem,</hi>
                  as against Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  being
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And then will
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> come very opportunely
                  in to help us,
                
                who speaking
                  of S. <hi>James</hi> his constant residence in
                  <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  doth resolve it thus. <hi>Quanquam
                  commune
                  illi cum reliquis collegis mandatum erat,</hi> c.
                  <hi>Although,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>the Lords
                  Commandment of preaching
                  to all Nations,
                  was
                  common unto him
                  with the residue of the Lords
                  Apostles,
                  yet I conceive, that they did
                  so divide the charge amongst them,
                  as to leave him
                  always
                  at</hi> Hierusalem,
                  <hi>whither such store of strangers
                  did
                  use continually
                  to resort.</hi> Id enim perinde erat ac si Evangelium
                  long latque promulgasset in locis
                  remotis; <hi>for that,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>was
                  as sufficient, as if he had
                  promulgated,
                  or preached
                  the Gospel in the parts
                  remote.</hi> This if it may be used
                  for <hi>James,</hi> will serve for <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  Assuredly
                  there was
                  a greater
                  confluence of all sorts
                  of strangers
                  to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> than
                  used
                  to be unto <hi>Hierusalem:</hi>
                  and therefore
                  <hi>Peter</hi> being
                  there, might spread abroad the Gospel with the
                  greater
                  speed; and with no less success than those others
                  did,
                  who did
                  not fix themselves in a certain
                  station.
                  But whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> doth object in another
                  place,
                
                that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing
                  to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  and saluting
                  many of the Saints
                  there, makes
                  no speech of <hi>Peter;</hi> and that
                  writing
                  many of his Epistles
                  from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> he
                  makes
                  no mention of him
                  neither: this may infer indeed, that Saint
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was
                  then absent, when those things
                  were
                  done,
                  as one that had
                  not so immured
                  himself in the walls
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that he travelled
                  up and down in several quarters
                  of the world: doing
                  sometimes
                  the Office of an
                  Apostle, discharging
                  otherwhiles
                  the place and function of a Bishop. All the
                  Epistles
                  of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which bear date from
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> were
                  written
                  in the first two years
                  of his being
                  there: and therefore any argument
                  derived
                  from thence must be very weak, either to prove that
                  <hi>Peter</hi> never was
                  at <hi>Rome,</hi> or never Bishop of that place:
                  being
                  so many ancient Writers
                  do affirm them
                  both. And yet I would not have the
                  Papists
                  think that this makes
                  any more for the Popes
                  supremacy, because he sits
                  in <hi>Peters</hi>
                  seat: than it did
                  make for <hi>Vibius Rufus</hi> to attain
                  <hi>Tullies</hi> eloquence,
                
                or <hi>Caesars</hi> power, because he
                  married
                  <hi>Tullies</hi> Widow, and bought
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Chair; though the poor Gentleman, as
                  the story telleth
                  us,  did
                  presume on both.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to go on, the Church of Christ
                  being
                  thus setled
                  by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                
                both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antioch:</hi> his next
                  great care is
                  for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the great and most
                  renowned
                  City in the parts
                  of <hi>Africa:</hi> that so there might be no prime City
                  in all the habitable World, to which the Gospel
                  was
                  not preached.
                  In the discharge of this great business,
                  was
                  Saint <hi>Mark</hi> employed;
                  a principal and constant follower of Saint
                  <hi>Peters,</hi>
                  who mentioneth
                  him
                  in his Epistle by the name of <hi>Son.</hi>
                
                <hi>The Church which is
                  at Babylon saluteth
                  you, and so doth</hi> Marcus <hi>my son.</hi> The
                  planting
                  of this Church is
                  thus remembred
                  by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> , c.
                
                <hi>It is
                  affirmed,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>that</hi> Mark <hi>did
                  first (of all Christs followers)
                  pass into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and there promulge and preach
                  the Gospel, which before he writ; and that he first
                  did
                  plant the Church of</hi> Alexandria: <hi>in which his
                  undertakings
                  had
                  so good success, that on his very first
                  endeavours,</hi>
                  , <hi>as the Author
                  hath
                  it, great multitudes
                  both of Men
                  and Women
                  did
                  believe in Christ; his holiness, and strict behaviour
                  gaining
                  much upon them.</hi>
                  This Church as he first founded
                  in the faith of Christ, so did
                  he take upon himself the charge thereof, and
                  became
                  Bishop of the same. This witnesseth
                  S. <hi>Hierom</hi> of him,
                  <hi>Marcus interpres Petri Apostoli,  Alexandrinae
                  Ecclesiae primus Episeopus:</hi>
                
                that <hi>Mark</hi> the interpreter of Saint
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> was
                  the first Bishop of the Church of
                  <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  The same he also doth affirm in his Epistle to
                  <hi>Euagrius;</hi>
                  whereof more anon. And when <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth
                  inform us,
                
                that in the eighth
                  year of the Emperour
                  <hi>Nero, Anianus</hi> a right godly Man,
                  , as the story
                  calls
                  him,
                  succeeded
                  <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist in <hi>Alexandria:</hi> he
                  doth infer <hi>ex consequenti,</hi>
                  that <hi>Mark</hi> was
                  Bishop there before him.
                  So that is
                  seemeth
                  he sat there 19. years
                  by this account. For he came
                  hither <hi>Anno</hi> 45. being
                  the third of <hi>Claudins Caesar;</hi>
                  and finished
                  his course in the eighth
                  of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was
                  the 64. of our Redeemer.
                  Finally,
                  <hi>Anianus</hi> having
                  continued
                  Bishop here 23 years,
                  died
                  in the 4th.
                
                year of <hi>Domitianus,</hi> being
                  <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 87. and had
                  <hi>Abilius</hi> to succeed him:
                  after whom
                  <hi>Cerdo</hi> did
                  succeed, in the year 100. what time <hi>Abilius</hi>
                  left this World, S. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle
                
                
                
                being
                  yet alive. So that there were
                  four Bishops
                  of <hi>Alexandria</hi> succeeding
                  one another
                  in that weighty charge, during the
                  lives
                  of the Apostles:
                  a pregnant evidence that they both
                  instituted
                  and approved
                  the calling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now for the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                
                there are some things
                  observed
                  by the Fathers,
                  which are worth our noting,
                  and may give great light to the present business; It
                  is
                  observed
                  by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                
                that <hi>Alexandria</hi> never had
                  two Bishops,
                  , as had
                  other Cities:
                  which words
                  not rightly
                  understood
                  have made
                  some conceive, that anciently
                  Bishops
                  were
                  the same with Presbyters,
                  it being
                  against the usual custom to have two
                  Bishops
                  in one Church or City. But if we look
                  considerately
                  upon <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                  there is
                  no such matter: all that he drives
                  at being
                  this, that whereas in most other
                  Churches,
                  for the preventing
                  of schisms
                  and factions
                  amongst the people, in the electing
                  of their Bishops,
                  it had
                  been
                  ordinary for the Bishop yet in place, to
                  consecrate
                  some one or other that should assist
                  him
                  whilst he lived,
                  and succeed after his decease:
                  only the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> never
                  had
                  that custom. And they that had
                  that custom,
                
                as it seems,
                  did
                  not like it well: for whereas <hi>Valerius</hi> Bishop
                  of <hi>Hippo,</hi> out of a vehement desire to have S.
                  <hi>Austin</hi> his successour,
                  did
                  consecrate or ordain him
                  Bishop, whilst as himself was
                  yet alive. Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  was
                  resolved
                  for his part not to do the like: it
                  being
                  a thing prohibited
                  by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. <hi>Quod ergo
                  reprehensum
                  est in me, noli reprehendi in filio meo,</hi> as he
                  there resolveth.
                  So that the place in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  tendeth
                  unto this alone, <hi>viz.</hi> to
                  shew
                  the reason why <hi>Athanasius</hi> could not succeed
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> in that See, though by
                  him
                  designed:
                  which was,
                  that he being
                  yet alive,
                
                it was
                  against the custom of that Church to ordain another.
                  Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> secondly,
                  observeth,
                  that the Presbyters
                  of <hi>Alexandria, unum ex se electum in
                  excelsiori
                  gradu collocatum Episcopum nominabant,</hi>
                  did
                  use to chuse
                  one from amongst themselves,
                  whom
                  being
                  placed
                  in a more eminent degree, than any of the rest, they
                  called
                  a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And this saith
                  he, continued
                  in that Church, <hi> Marco Evangelista, ad
                  Heraclam  Dionysium Episcopos:</hi> from the time
                  of <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist until the
                  Bishopricks
                  of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
                
                Some hereupon infer, that the persons
                  who brought
                  in the imparity of Ministers
                  into the Church, were
                  not the Apostles,
                  but the Presbyters.
                  An
                  inference as faulty, as was
                  that before. All that Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  means
                  is
                  this, that from the time of <hi>Mark,</hi> till the
                  days
                  of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the
                  Presbyters
                  of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had
                  no other Bishop than one whom
                  they had
                  chosen
                  out of their own body: just as a man may say, on the
                  like occasion, that from the first foundation till the
                  time of Sir <hi>H, Savil,</hi> the
                  Colledg
                  of <hi>Eaton</hi> never had
                  a Provost but one,
                
                whom
                  they had
                  chosen
                  out of their own society. Now <hi>Heraclas</hi> before
                  he was
                  ordained
                  Bishop was
                  not a Presbyter of that Church, although a Reader in the
                  Schools
                  of that famous City; and belike <hi>Dionysius</hi> also
                  was.
                  And therefore it is
                  well observed
                  by the Cardinal; that <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  writing
                  to <hi>Euagrius</hi>
                  relateth,
                  <hi>quid in ea Ecclesia
                  usque ad haec Dionysii tempora in
                  electione
                  Episcoporum agi consueverit:</hi>
                
                what was
                  the usage of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the
                  election of their Bishops,
                  until the times
                  of <hi>Dionysus.</hi> However we have
                  gained
                  thus much by <hi>Hierom,</hi> that from <hi>Mark</hi>
                  downward
                  till those times,
                  and a long time after, there wanted
                  not a Bishop, properly
                  so called,
                
                in that famous Church: and therefore sure they
                  came
                  not first into the Church, <hi>Diaboli instinctu,</hi>
                  by the Devils
                  instinct. as he elsewhere saith.

                There is
                  another observation in the Commentaries
                  ascribed
                  to <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                
                which having
                  some resemblance unto that before, and a like sinister
                  use being
                  made
                  thereof: I
                  shall here lay down: and after give some
                  Annotations
                  on it to explain the place.
                
                The Author of those Commentaries
                  affirmeth,
                  that <hi>Timothy</hi> whom
                  <hi>Paul</hi> created
                  Presbyter, <hi>was
                  by him
                  called
                  a Bishop, because the first Presbyters
                  were
                  called
                  Bishops:
                  it being
                  the custom of the Church (for so I think the sense must
                  be made
                  up)</hi> ut recedente
                  eo sequens ei succederet; <hi>that he [the first]
                  departing,
                  the next in order should succeed. But
                  being
                  it was
                  found that the following
                  Presbyters
                  were
                  utterly
                  unworthy of so high preferment, that course
                  was
                  altered;
                  and it was
                  provided
                  by a Council,</hi> ut non ordo, sed meritum crearet
                  Episcopum, c. <hi>that merit, and not seniority
                  should raise a man, he being
                  appointed
                  by the suffrages
                  of many Priests,
                  to be a Bishop, lest an
                  unfit person rashly
                  should usurp the place, and so become a
                  publick
                  scandal.</hi> These are the Authors
                  words,
                
                be he who he will. And from hence <hi>Beza</hi> doth
                  collect that Bishops
                  differed
                  not from Presbyters
                  in the Apostles
                  times;
                  that there was
                  only in every place a President
                  of the Presbytery, who called
                  them
                  together, and porposed things
                  needful for their consideration; that this priority
                  went
                  round by course, every one holding
                  it in his turn for a week, or more,
                  according
                  as the Priests
                  in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple had
                  their
                
                
                weekly courses;
                  and finally,
                  that this Apostolical and primitive order
                  was
                  after changed,
                  upon the motives
                  and inducements
                  before remembred.
                
                Some of our modern Writers
                  against Episcopacy have gone
                  more warily
                  to work than so, affirming
                  from those words
                  of <hi>Ambrose</hi> (or whosoever
                  was
                  the Author) that this <hi>Rectorship, or priority
                  was
                  devolved
                  at first from one Elder to another by succession; when
                  he who was
                  in the place was
                  removed,
                  the next in order amongst the Elders
                  succeeded;
                  and that this course was
                  after changed
                  the better to keep out unworthy
                  men,
                  it being
                  made
                  a matter of election, and not a matter of
                  succession.</hi> These men
                  come neer
                  the point in their Exposition, though they keep far
                  enough in the Application, inferring
                  hence that the <hi>imparity of Ministers
                  came
                  in otherwise
                  than by divine Authority.</hi> For by
                  comparing
                  this of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> with that before
                  mentioned
                  out of <hi>Hierom,</hi> the meaning
                  of the Author will be only this, that as in some
                  places
                  the Presbyters
                  elected
                  one of their own Presbytery to be their Bishop; so for
                  preventing
                  of Ambition, and avoiding
                  Faction, they did
                  agree amongst themselves,
                  <hi>ut uno recedente,</hi> that as the place
                  did
                  vaike by death or deprivation, by
                  resignation,
                  cession, banishment, or any other
                  means
                  whatever, the Senior of the whole Presbytery should
                  succeed therein; as the Lord Mayor
                  is
                  chosen
                  for his year in <hi>London.</hi> But after upon sight of
                  those inconveniences,
                  which did
                  thence arise, it was
                  thought fit in their election of the person, rather to
                  look upon his Merit than his Seniority. So that for all
                  this place of <hi>Ambrose</hi> (were
                  those Comments
                  his) the Bishop may enjoy a fixt
                  preheminence,
                  and hold it by divine Authority, not by humane
                  Ordinances.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to return unto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the
                  Churches
                  by him
                  planted,
                
                and founded
                  by him
                  in <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in these <hi>Western</hi>
                  parts;
                  I shall in part rely on the Authority of the
                  <hi>Martyrologie</hi>
                  of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> though so fat only, and
                  no further, as it is
                  backed
                  by venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> and <hi>Usuardus,</hi>
                  ancient Writers
                  both, the latest
                  living
                  in the year 800. and besides
                  them,
                  in some particulars
                  by other Authors
                  of far more Antiquity.
                
                And these, for better methods
                  sake, we will behold according
                  to the several Countries,
                  into which S. <hi>Peter</hi> either
                  went
                  himself, or sent
                  forth his Disciples
                  to them,
                  to preach the Gospel. And first for <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  besides
                  the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before
                  remembred.
                  We find <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> (not he that
                  is
                  commemorated
                  by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  these, we read that <hi>Trophimus,</hi> once one of S.

                  was

                  (for so <hi>Sacerdos</hi> must be read in that whole

                  were
                  Bishops

                  Disciples
                  also, by him
                  employed
                  to preach the Gospel to that Nation; which
                  having
                  done
                  with good effect in the City of

                he was
                  made
                  the first Bishop of that City. And unto this
                  <hi>Methodius</hi> also doth attest,
                
                as he is
                  cited
                  by <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> who
                  tells
                  us, that after he had
                  held
                  the Bishoprick
                  23 years,
                  <hi>Valerio Trevericae Ecclesiae culmen dereliquit,</hi>
                  he left the government
                  of that Church unto <hi>Valerius,</hi> who together with
                  <hi>Maternus,</hi> (both being
                  Disciples
                  of Saint <hi>Peper</hi>) did
                  attend him
                  thither; and that <hi>Maternus</hi> after fifteen
                  years
                  did
                  succeed <hi>Valerius,</hi> continuing
                  Bishop there 40 years
                  together. I should much wrong our part of
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> should I leave out that, as if
                  neglected
                  by the Apostle, concerning
                  which we are informed
                  by <hi>Metaphrastes</hi>
                  (whose credit hath
                  been
                  elsewhere vindicated)
                  that this Apostle coming
                  into <hi>Britain,</hi>
                
                and tarrying
                  there a certain time, and enlightning
                  many with the word of grace, ,
                  did
                  constitute Churches,
                  and ordain
                  Bishops,
                  Presbyters,
                  and Deacons
                  in the same. Which action as he
                  placeth
                  in the twelfth
                  year of <hi>Nero,</hi> being
                  the 67. of our Redeemer; so he professeth,
                  that he had
                  his information out of some writings
                  of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which have not come unto our
                  hands,
                  but with a great deal more of that
                  Authors
                  works,
                  have perished
                  in the ruins
                  and wrack of time. Nor is
                  it strange that the Apostle should make so many of his
                  Disciples
                  Bishops,
                  before or shortly
                  after they were
                  sent
                  abroad to gain the nations
                  to the Faith,
                
                that being
                  the usual course in the like imployments,
                  as may appear by <hi>Austins</hi>
                  being
                  consecrated
                  Bishop, immediately
                  after his first coming
                  into <hi>England.</hi> The reason
                  was,
                  as I conceive it, that if God prospered
                  their endeavours
                  with desired
                  success,
                  they might be furnished
                  with a power of ordaining
                  Presbyters
                  for their assistance in that service. And so much for
                  the Churches
                  planted
                  by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his
                  Disciples.

                WE are now come unto S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                
                and to the Churches
                  by him
                  planted,
                  where we shall meet with clearer
                  evidence from Scripture than before we
                  had.
                  A man that did
                  at first most eagerly
                  afflict the poor Church of Christ; as if it
                  were
                  the destiny not of <hi>David</hi> only, but also of the
                  Son of <hi>David,</hi> to be persecuted
                  by the hands
                  of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                
                But as the <hi>Rhemists</hi>
                  well observe, that the contention between <hi>Paul</hi>
                  and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> fell out unto the great increase
                  of Christianity: So did
                  this persecution raised
                  by <hi>Saul,</hi> fall out unto the great improvement of
                  the Gospel. For by this means,
                  the Disciples
                  being
                  scattered
                  and dispersed
                  abroad, the Gospel was
                  by them
                  disseminated
                  in all the parts
                  and Countreys
                  where they came;
                  and <hi>Saul</hi> himself being
                  taken
                  off, even in the middle of his fury,
                  became
                  the greatest
                  instrument of Gods
                  power and glory in the converting
                  of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  For presently
                  upon his own Conversion, we
                
                
                find him
                  Preaching
                  in the <hi>Synagogues
                  of Damascus,</hi>
                
                thence taking
                  a long journey into <hi>Arabia,</hi> from thence
                  returning
                  to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  afterwards
                  travelling
                  towards
                  <hi>Tarsus</hi> his own native soyl,
                  and thence brought
                  back to <hi>Antio_h,</hi>
                  by the means
                  of <hi>Barnabas.</hi> And all this while I look upon
                  him
                  as an
                  Evangelist only, a constant and a zealous Preacher of
                  the Gospel of Christ, in every Region where he
                  travelled_.
                  His calling
                  unto the Apostleship, was
                  not until the Holy Ghost had
                  said
                  unto the Prophets
                  <hi>Lucius,</hi>
                
                <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Manahen,</hi>
                  ministring
                  then in <hi>Antiochia, Separate mihi Barnabam 
                  Saulum; separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul,
                  <hi>for the work whereunto I have
                  called
                  them.</hi>
                  An
                  extraordinary
                  call, and therefore done
                  by extraordinary means,
                  and Ministers.
                  For being
                  the persons
                  here employed
                  in this Ordination, neither were
                  Apostles,
                  nor yet advanced
                  for ought we find, unto the estate and honour of
                  Episcopacy, it most be reckoned
                  amongst those Extraordinaries
                  which God pleased
                  to work, in, and about the calling
                  of this blessed
                  Apostle. Of which we may affirm with
                  <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> ,
                
                that of the things
                  which did
                  befall S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his whole vocation, there
                  was
                  nothing ordinary, but every part
                  was
                  acted
                  by the hand of God. God in his extraordinary
                  works
                  ties
                  not himself to ordinary means
                  and courses,
                  but takes
                  such ways,
                  and doth imploy
                  such instruments
                  as himself best pleaseth,
                  for the more evident demonstration of his power and
                  glory. So that however <hi>Simeon, Manahen,</hi> and
                  <hi>Lucius</hi> did
                  <hi>lay hands
                  upon him;</hi>
                  yet being
                  the call and designation was
                  so miraculous,
                  he might well say that he was
                  made
                  <hi>an
                  Apostle neither of men,
                  nor by men.
                  but of Jesus Christ and God the Father. Chrysostom</hi>
                  so expounds
                  the place, <hi>Not of Men,</hi>
                  ,
                
                so to make it manifest, that he
                  received
                  not his call from them;
                  not by men;
                  because he was
                  not sent
                  by them,
                  but by the Spirit. As for the work, to which he
                  was
                  thus separated
                  by the Lord, ask the said
                  Father what it was,
                  and he will tell you , that it
                  was
                  the office of an
                  Apostle; and that he was
                  ordained
                  an
                  Apostle here, , that he might Preach
                  the Gospel with the greater
                  power. Ask who it was
                  that did
                  ordain him,
                  and he will tell you, that howsoever <hi>Manahen,
                  Lucius</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi>
                  did
                  lay hands
                  upon him,
                  , yet he received
                  his Ordination by the Holy Ghost. And
                  certainly,
                  that he had
                  not the Apostleship before, may be
                  made
                  manifest by that which followed
                  after. For we do not find in all the story of his
                  Acts,
                  that either he ordained
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  or gave
                  the Holy Ghost, or wrought
                  any miracles,
                  which were
                  the signs
                  of his Apostleship, before this solemn Ordination,
                
                or imposition of the hands
                  of the said
                  three Prophets;
                  as afterwards
                  we find he did
                  in several places
                  of that book, and shall now shew
                  (as it relates
                  unto our present business) in that which
                  followeth.
              </p>
              <p>
                <hi>Paul</hi> being
                  thus advanced
                  by God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ,
                
                to the high place of an
                  Apostle, immediately
                  applyeth
                  himself unto the same: Preaching
                  the Word with power, and miracles,
                  in the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
                
                from thence proceeding
                  to <hi>Pamphylia</hi> and other
                  Provinces
                  of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> every where
                  gaining
                  Souls
                  to Almighty
                  God. Having
                  spent
                  three years
                  in those parts
                  of <hi>Asia,</hi> and planted
                  Churches
                  in a great part thereof, he had
                  a mind to go again to <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                
                <hi>from whence be had
                  been
                  recommended
                  to the grace of God, for the work which he
                  had
                  fulsilled.</hi> But fearing
                  lest the Doctrine
                  he had
                  Preached
                  amongst them,
                  might either be forgotten,
                  or produce no profit, if there were
                  none left to attend that service: Before he
                  went,
                  he thought it fitting
                  to found a Ministery
                  amongst them,
                  in their several Churches.
                  To this end, <hi>They</hi> (i.e. He and
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi>) <hi>ordained
                  them
                  Presbyters
                  in every Church, with prayer and
                  fasting;</hi>
                
                and that being
                  done,
                  they recommended
                  him
                  unto <hi>the Lord, in whom
                  they believed.</hi>
                  This is
                  the first Ordination which we find of
                  Presbyters
                  in holy Scripture; though doubtless
                  there were
                  many before this time. The Church could neither be
                  instructed,
                  nor consist at all, without an
                  ordinary Minister left amongst the people, for the
                  Administration
                  of the Word and Sacraments.
                  However, this being
                  as I said,
                  the first record thereof in holy Scripture; we will
                  consider hereupon, first to what Office they
                  were
                  called,
                  which are here called
                  Presbyters:
                  Secondly,
                  by whom
                  they were
                  Ordained:
                  And thirdly,
                  by what means
                  they were
                  called
                  unto it. First, for the Office what it
                  was,
                  I find some difference amongst Expositors,
                  as well new as old. <hi>Beza</hi>
                  conceives
                  the word in a general sense, and to include at once,
                  Pastors
                  and Deacons,
                  and whoever
                  else were
                  set apart for the rule and government of the
                  Churches
                  to them
                  committed.
                
                <hi>Presbyteros,</hi> i.e. <hi>Pastores,
                  Diaconos,  alios Ecclesiae gubernationi
                  praefectos,</hi> as his own words
                  are. Here we have pastors,
                  Deacons,
                  Governours,
                  included
                  in this one word Presbyters.
                  Ask <hi>Lyra</hi> who those Governours
                  were,
                
                which <hi>Beza</hi> calls
                  <hi>praefecti</hi>
                
                
                
                in a general name, and he will tell you they
                  were
                  Bishops.
                  <hi>Nomine Presbyterorum hic intelliguntur etiam alii
                  Ecclesiae Ministri; ut Episcopi  Diaconi:</hi>
                  Under the name of Presbyters,
                  saith
                  he, are comprehended
                  also other Ecclesiastical Ministers,
                  as Bishops
                  and Deacons.
                
                The ordinary gloss agrees
                  herewith, as to that of Bishops;
                  and gives
                  this reason for the same, <hi>Illo
                  autem
                  tempore ejusdem
                  erant nominis Episcopi  Presbyteri,</hi> that in
                  that time Bishops
                  and Presbyters
                  were
                  called
                  by the same name.
                
                And <hi>Oecumenius</hi>
                  holds
                  together with them,
                  as to that of Deacons;
                  nothing that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                  had
                  Epifcopal Authority, , in that they
                  did
                  not only ordain Deacons,
                  but also Presbyters.
                  So that it seemeth
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> provided
                  here against all occasions,
                  fetling the Churches
                  by him
                  planted
                  in so sure a way, that there was
                  nothing
                  left at random, which either did
                  relate to government, or point of Doctrine. And yet if
                  any shall contend, that those who here are
                  called
                  Presbyters,
                  were
                  but simply
                  such, according
                  to the notion of that word, as it
                  is
                  now used;
                  I shall not much insist upon it. I only
                  shew
                  what other Authors
                  have affirmed
                  herein; and so leave it off.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next thing here to be considered,
                
                is
                  who they were
                  that were
                  the Agents
                  in this Ordination. <hi>Cum constituissent illis,</hi>
                  when they had
                  Ordained;
                  and <hi>they,</hi> is
                  there a relative, and points
                  to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
                  mentioned
                  <hi>v.</hi> 20. They preached
                  the Gospel, they returned
                  to <hi>Lystra,</hi> and finally
                  they here Ordained.
                  Of any one that laid
                  hands
                  with them
                  on these Presbyters
                  heads,
                  which was
                  the ceremony by them
                  used
                  in this Ordination (as the word ,
                  doth plainly
                  manifest) <hi>ne My Lucilianum,</hi> not a word in
                  Scripture. Indeed it cannot be conceived
                  that in those places
                  wherein there were
                  no men
                  in Sacred Orders,
                  any should joyn
                  with the Apostles
                  in that sacred action. So that the
                  Presbyters,
                  which were
                  here ordained,
                  could have no other hands
                  laid
                  on them
                  than those of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> if
                  they joyned
                  together; and did
                  not rather severally
                  and apart perform that ceremony. And if that the
                  Apostles
                  by the imposition of their own hands
                  only, could perform it now; how
                  came
                  they to be shortned
                  after? how came
                  they so devested
                  of that sacred priviledge,
                  as to want others to be joyned
                  with them,
                  and not to make a Presbyter without the co-assistancy of
                  the Presbytery? The Holy Ghost was
                  no less powerful in them
                  after this, than it had
                  been
                  formerly;
                  neither did
                  <hi>Paul</hi> or want, or crave the help of any, in
                  giving
                  of the Holy Ghost on the like occasions,
                  in the times
                  that followed.
                  Certain I am,
                
                when <hi>Paul</hi> was
                  at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though <hi>Timothy</hi> and others
                  were
                  then present with him,
                  yet none but he laid
                  hands
                  upon the twelve Disciples:
                  And yet upon the laying
                  on of his hands,
                  <hi>The Holy Ghost came
                  on them,
                  and they spake
                  with tongues
                  and prophesied.</hi>
                  Which if it were
                  an
                  Act of Ordination,
                
                as <hi>Beza</hi> thinks,
                  and it is
                  likely so to be, because
                  the Text saith
                  that they spake
                  <hi>with tongues
                  and prophesied;</hi>
                  then have we here more Presbyters
                  created
                  by laying
                  on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands
                  only, without help of others. As for that passage in the
                  first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                
                wherein the Presbytery may be thought to lay
                  hands
                  upon him;
                  let it be ballanced
                  with another in the second Epistle, where the Apostle
                  doth assume the whole performance to himself, as his
                  proper act; and then the difference which
                  appears
                  will be quickly
                  ended.
                  If <hi>Timothy</hi> received
                  those gifts
                  which did
                  enable him
                  for the Holy Ministery,
                  by laying
                  on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands
                  only, as it seems
                  he did;
                  what interest could the Presbytery challenge in that
                  sacred action? If he received
                  it joyntly
                  from the Presbytery, what influence
                  had
                  Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hands
                  on him
                  more than all the rest? Assuredly
                  Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hands
                  were
                  not grown
                  so impotent, that they needed
                  help; or that he could not give the
                  graces
                  of the Holy Ghost, by laying
                  on his own hands
                  only, as he had
                  done
                  formerly.
                  And therefore if the Presbytery
                  did
                  concur herein, it was
                  not that the business could not be
                  performed
                  without them,
                  but either to declare the good affections
                  which they did
                  bear unto the person, or to express
                  their joyful approbation of his
                  calling
                  to that sacred function,
                
                of whom
                  so many Prophesies
                  had
                  gone
                  out before; or finally
                  to contribute their prayers
                  and blessings
                  to the solemnity of so grave and great a work, And so, I
                  think, the business will be best
                  made
                  up, if <hi>Paul</hi> be suffered
                  to enjoy the honour of giving
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the imposition of his
                  hands,
                  the gifts
                  and graces
                  of the Spirit; and the Presbytery be
                  permitted
                  not to want their share in the performance of the
                  outward ceremony. Certainly
                  that the power of Ordination was
                  in one alone, that is
                  to say, in the Apostle, is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                
                Who having
                  canvassed
                  the point, doth resolve at last, <hi>Unum tantum fuisse
                  qui manus imponeret:</hi> Which
                  is
                  indeed the safest
                  tenet, and most agreeable unto Antiquity.
                
                And therefore <hi>Estius,</hi> in my mind,
                  did
                  resolve it well, when he did
                  thus divide the business: <hi>Ceremoniam impositionis
                  manuum,  pluribus fuisse adhibitam;
                
                
                sed solum Paulum ea peregisse, quae [Sacramento] erant
                  substantialia.</hi> Unless perhaps we may conceive, as
                  perhaps we may, that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  received
                  two Ordinations;
                  the one unto the Office of a Presbyter, in which the
                  Presbytery might concur as to the
                  outward
                  pomp or ceremony; the other to the function of a Bishop,
                  in which, because the Presbyters
                  might not concur, no not so much as to the outward act
                  or ceremony, he was
                  Ordained
                  by laying
                  on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands
                  only.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last thing offer'd to consideration,
                
                is
                  the election of the persons
                  which are here ordained:
                  which some refer unto the people:
                  Concerning
                  that the word , which Saint
                  <hi>Luke</hi> here useth,
                  doth signifie
                  a popular manner of election, used
                  by the <hi>holding
                  up of hands.
                  Ortum est hoc verbum ex Groecorum consuetudine,</hi>
                
                <hi>qui porrectis manibus suffragia ferebant,</hi> as
                  <hi>Beza</hi> notes
                  it on the place; who hereupon translates
                  the word, <hi>Cum per suffragia creassent,</hi> wherein
                  he hath
                  been
                  followed
                  by some Translators
                  of our Bibles,
                  who express it thus, <hi>When they
                  had
                  created
                  Elders
                  by Election.</hi> But whatsoever
                  use the word might have in the old <hi>Greek</hi>
                  Writers,
                  assuredly,
                  it either had
                  no such use now; or if it had,
                  it quite excludes the people of those
                  Churches
                  from having
                  any hand in this Election. , however
                  used
                  amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                  to signifie
                  the approbation of the people, testifyed
                  by the holding
                  up of their hands;
                  yet in the Church-construction it
                  signifyeth
                  Ordination, done
                  by the laying
                  on of hands.
                  And this, to save the labour of a further search,
                  is
                  very throughly
                  avouched
                  by <hi>Calvin,</hi>
                
                where he acknowledgeth,
                  that amongst Ecclesiastical Writers,
                  the word , was
                  used
                  <hi>pro solenni ordinationis ritu,</hi> for the solemn
                  ceremony of Ordination, which is
                  in holy Scripture called
                  Imposition of hands.
                  Particular instances
                  hereof, he that lists
                  to see, may find them
                  gathered
                  to his hand in the learned
                  work of Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi>
                
                before remembred.
                  But whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> hence
                  collecteth,
                  that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabus</hi>
                  permitted
                  the Election of these Presbyters
                  to the common suffrage of the people, and that
                  themselves
                  did
                  only preside therein, <hi>Quasi moderatores, ne quid
                  rumultuose fieret,</hi> only as
                  Moderators
                  of the business, to see that it
                  was
                  fairly
                  carried:
                  What other ground soever he might have for his
                  conjecture, assuredly
                  he could collect none from the word here
                  used.
                  For if that 
                  did
                  signifie
                  election by holding
                  up of hands,
                
                <hi>qualiter in Comitiis populi fieri solet,</hi> as in
                  Assemblies
                  of the people it did
                  use to be; as he himself affirms
                  it doth: Then certainly
                  none but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                  holding
                  up their hands,
                  (for none but they were
                  , in the present business) the whole
                  election of these Presbyters
                  must be given
                  to them.
                  But indeed it was
                  neither so, nor so. Neither the Apostle nor the People
                  had
                  any hand in the elections
                  of those times,
                  but the Spirit of God, which evidently
                  did
                  design and mark out those men
                  whom
                  God intended
                  to imploy
                  in his holy Ministery.
                  The words
                  of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> make this clear
                  enough, where it is
                  said,
                  <hi>Neglect not the gift that is
                  in thee,
                  which was
                  given
                  thee
                  by Prophesie,</hi>
                
                c. and that there went
                  some Prophesies
                  before concerning
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> the same Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  hath
                  told
                  us in the first Chapter of that first Epistle.
                
                <hi>Chrysostom</hi> notes
                  upon these words,
                  that in those times
                  , the Priests
                  and Ministers
                  of God were
                  made
                  by Prophesie,
                  that is,
                  saith
                  he, , by the Holy Ghost. And this he
                  proves
                  by the selection of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                  to the work of God, which was
                  done
                  by Prophesie
                  and by the Spirit. And finally
                  glossing
                  on those words,
                  <hi>Noli negligere gratiam,</hi> c. he doth thus
                  express it, , <hi>God,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>did
                  elect thee
                  to this weighty charge, he hath
                  committed
                  no small part of his Church unto
                  thee,</hi>
                  , <hi>no mortal man
                  had
                  any hand in that designation: and therefore take thou
                  beed that thou disgrace not, nor dishonour so Divine a
                  calling.</hi>
                  More might be said,
                  both from <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> to
                  confirm this Truth;
                
                but that I think it is
                  sufficiently
                  confirmed
                  already.
              </p>
              <p>
                So then, the Presbyters
                  of these times,
                  being
                  of Gods
                  special choice,
                
                his own designation;
                  and those upon the laying
                  on of such holy hands,
                  furnished
                  by the Spirit with such gifts
                  and graces
                  as might enable them
                  sufficiently
                  to discharge their calling:
                  The marvel is
                  the less, if in those early days,
                  at the first dawning,
                  as it were,
                  of Christianity,
                  we find so little speech of Bishops.
                  In the ordaining
                  of these Presbyters,
                  as also of the like in other places,
                  the Apostles
                  might, and did
                  no question, communicate unto
                  them,
                  such, and so much Authority as might invest
                  them
                  with a power of government,
                  during the times
                  of their own necessary absence from those several
                  Churches.
                  So that however they were
                  Presbyters
                  in degree and order, yet they both
                  were
                  and might be trusted
                  with an
                  Episcopal jurisdiction in their several
                  Cities;
                  even as some <hi>Deans,</hi>
                  although but simply
                  Presbyters,
                  are with us in <hi>England.</hi> And of this rank I take
                  it were
                  the Presbyters
                  in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                
                whom
                  the Apostle calleth
                  by the
                
                
                
                name of Bishops;
                  that is
                  to say, Presbyters
                  by their Order and Degree, but Bishops
                  in regard of their jurisdiction. Such also those
                  ordained
                  by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Church of
                  <hi>Philippos,</hi>
                
                whom
                  the Apostle mentioneth
                  in the very entrance of his Epistle to that people.
                  Which as it may be some occasion, why
                  Bishops
                  properly
                  so called,
                  were
                  not ordained
                  by the Apostles,
                  in the first planting
                  of some Churches:
                  so there are other reasons
                  alledged
                  for it, and are briefly
                  these. For first, although the Presbyters
                  in those times
                  were
                  by the Holy Ghost endued
                  with many excellent gifts
                  and graces,
                  requisite to the Preaching
                  of the Word, yet the Apostles
                  might not think fit to trust them
                  with the chief government, till they
                  had
                  fully
                  seen,
                  and perfectly
                  made
                  tryal
                  of their abilities
                  and parts
                  that way.
                
                And this is
                  that which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> meaneth
                  in his dispute against <hi>Aerius,</hi>
                  saying,
                  , c. <hi>that where there
                  were
                  no fit men
                  to discharge that Office, the place
                  remained
                  without a Bishop; but where necessity
                  required,
                  and that there wanted
                  not fit men
                  to supply the place, there Bishops
                  forthwith were
                  appointed.</hi>
                  But that which I conceive to be the
                  principal
                  reason, was
                  this, that the Apostle did
                  reserve unto himself the chief Authority in all the
                  Churches
                  of his planting,
                  so long as he continued
                  in, or about those places:
                  And this he exercised
                  either by personal Visitations,
                  mention whereof is
                  made
                  in the 14.21. and 15.36. of the Book of
                  <hi>Acts;</hi>
                  or else by his <hi>rescripts</hi>
                  and <hi>mandates,</hi>
                  as in his sentencing
                  of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> although absent
                  thence. But when he was
                  resolved
                  to take a journey to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                
                and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> not
                  knowing
                  when he should return to those Eastern
                  parts,
                  and knowing
                  well that multitude of governours
                  do oft breed confusions,
                  and that equality of Ministers
                  did
                  oft end in factions:
                  he then resolved
                  to give them
                  Bishops,
                  to place a Chief in and above each several
                  Presbytery,
                  over every City; committing
                  unto them
                  that power aswell of Ordinations,
                  as inflicting
                  censures,
                  which he had
                  formerly
                  reserved
                  to himself alone. This great Apostle,
                  as for some space of time he taught
                  the Church, without help of Presbyters;
                  so for another while he did
                  rule the same without help of Bishops.
                  A time there was
                  wherein there were
                  no Bishops,
                  but the Apostles
                  only to direct the Church; and so there
                  was
                  a time wherein there were
                  no Presbyters,
                  but they, to instruct the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                However it must be confessed
                  that there was
                  a time in which some Churches
                  had
                  no Bishops.
                
                And this,
                
                if any, was
                  the time that Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  speaks
                  of, <hi>Cum communi Presbyterorum consilio ecclesiae
                  gubernabantur,</hi> when as the
                  Churches
                  were
                  governed
                  by the common counsel of the Presbyters.
                  But sure it was
                  so short a time, that had
                  not the good Father taken
                  a distaste against Episcopacy, by reason of some
                  differences
                  which he had
                  with <hi>John</hi> the Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                  he could not easily
                  have observed
                  it. For whether Bishops
                  were
                  ordained,
                
                <hi>In Schismatis remedium,</hi> as he
                  saith
                  elsewhere, for the preventing
                  of those Schisms
                  and factions
                  which were
                  then risen
                  in the Church; or that they were
                  appointed
                  by the Apostles
                  to supply their absence, when they
                  withdrew
                  themselves unto further Countreys:
                  This government of the Church in common by the
                  Presbyters,
                  will prove of very short continuance. For from the first
                  planting
                  of the Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                
                which was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 53. unto the writing
                  of his first Epistle to that Church and people, in which
                  he doth complain of the Schisms
                  amongst them,
                  was
                  but four whole years.
                  And yet it doth appear by that place in <hi>Hierom,</hi>
                  for ought can see, that the divisions
                  of the people in Religion, some
                  saying
                  <hi>I am
                  of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I
                  of</hi> Cephas, every one cleaving
                  unto him
                  by whom
                  he had
                  received
                  Baptism,
                  were
                  the occasion that it was
                  decreed
                  throughout the world, as that Father
                  saith,
                  <hi>Ut unus de Presbyteris electus, superponeretur
                  caeteris,</hi> that one of the Presbyters
                  should be set over the rest, to
                  whom
                  the care of all the Church should appertain, that so the
                  seeds
                  of schism might be rooted
                  up. And from the time when <hi>Paul</hi>
                  ordained
                  those Presbyters
                  in <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> and those other
                  Churches,
                  which was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 48. according
                  as <hi>Baronius</hi> calculates
                  it, unto Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s return unto
                  <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  which was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 58. are but ten whole
                  years.
                  Before which time, immediately
                  upon his resolution
                  to undertake that journey, and from thence to
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> he had
                  appointed
                  Bishops
                  in the Churches
                  of his own plantation; so that the government of the
                  Presbyters
                  in the largest
                  and most liberal allowance that can be
                  given
                  them,
                  will be too short a time to plead prescription. Now that
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ordained
                  Bishops
                  in many of the <hi>Asian</hi> Cities,
                  or in the Churches
                  of those Cities
                  which himself had
                  planted,
                  before his last going
                  thence into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedon;</hi> may
                  well be gathered
                  out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived
                  both neer
                  those times,
                  and in those parts,
                  and possibly
                  might have seen
                  and known
                  some of the Bishops
                  of this first foundation.
                
                Now <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words
                  are these. <hi>In
                
                
                Mileto enim convocatis Episcopis  Presbyteris, qui
                  erant ab Epheso  reliquis proximis
                  civitatibus,</hi>
                  c.
                <q><hi>Paul,</hi> saith
                  he, calling
                  together in <hi>Miletum,</hi> the
                  Bishops
                  and Presbyters,
                  which were
                  of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and other the
                  adjoyning
                  Cities,
                  told
                  them
                  what things
                  were
                  like to happen to him
                  in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  whither he meant
                  to go before the Feast.</q>
                Out of which words
                  of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> I collect thus much. First, that
                  those Presbyters
                  whom
                  <hi>Paul</hi> called
                  to <hi>Miletum,</hi> to meet him
                  there, were
                  not all of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though all
                  called
                  from <hi>Ephesus: Ephesus</hi> being
                  first appointed
                  for the Randevouz, or place of meeting:
                  and secondly,
                  that amongst those Presbyters
                  there were
                  some whom
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had
                  dignified
                  with the stile and place of Bishops:
                  In which regard the Assembly
                  being
                  of a mixt
                  condition, they are entituled
                  by both names;
                  especially
                  those Presbyters
                  which had
                  as yet no Bishops
                  over them,
                  having
                  the charge and jurisdiction of their
                  Churches
                  under the Apostles,
                  as before was
                  said.
                  And this perhaps may be one reason, why the Apostle in
                  his speech to that Assembly,
                  makes
                  no words
                  of <hi>Timothy;</hi> who being
                  present
                  with the rest, received
                  his charge together with them:
                  as also why he gave
                  the Presbyters
                  of <hi>Ephesus</hi> no particular charge, how to behave
                  themselves before their Bishop;
                  there being
                  many Bishops
                  there, which were
                  not under the command of <hi>Timothy.</hi> However we
                  may gather thus much out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that
                  though we find not in the Scripture the particular
                  names
                  of such as had
                  Episcopal Authority committed
                  to them,
                  but <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> yet that there
                  were
                  some other Bishops
                  at that time of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ordination, who
                  doubtless took
                  as great a care for <hi>Thessalonica</hi> and
                  <hi>Philippos,</hi> for <hi>Lystra</hi> and
                  <hi>Iconium,</hi> as for <hi>Crete</hi> and
                  <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And that these two
                  were
                  by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made
                  Bishops
                  of those places,
                  will appear most fully
                  by the concurrent testimony of ancient
                  Writers.
              </p>
              <p>
                And first for <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he
                  was
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                
                and the first Bishop
                  there, appeareth
                  by an
                  ancient Treatise of his death and martyrdom,
                  bearing
                  the name of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> who
                  was
                  himself not only Bishop of this Church of
                  <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but born also within six or seven and
                  thirty years
                  after the writing
                  of the Revelation by Saint <hi>John.</hi> Which treatise
                  of <hi>Polycrates</hi> entituled,
                  <hi>De martyrio Timothei,</hi>
                  is
                  extant amongst the lives
                  of Saints,
                  printed
                  at <hi>Lovaine, An.</hi>
                  1585. and cited
                  by the Learned
                  Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> in his brief Discourse
                  touching
                  the original of Episcopacy.
                
                Certain I am
                  that <hi>Sigebertus</hi> doth report <hi>Polycrates</hi>
                  to be the Author of a Book entituled,
                  <hi>De passione
                  Sancti Timothei
                  Apostoli;</hi> but whether that it ever
                  came
                  unto the hands
                  of those of <hi>Lovain,</hi>
                  I am
                  not able to determine. More like it
                  is,
                  the book is
                  perished,
                  and the fragments
                  of the Treatise which remain in <hi>Photius,</hi>
                
                touching
                  the death and martyrdom
                  of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is
                  all which have escaped
                  that shipwrack.
                  And yet in those poor fragments
                  there is
                  proof enough that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  was
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in which it
                  is
                  expresly
                  said,
                  , that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  was
                  both Ordained
                  and Inthroned
                  Bishop of the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> by
                  the great Apostle. Secondly,
                  this appeareth
                  by the testimony of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who
                  reckning
                  up Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> assistants,
                  his , and coadjutors,
                  as it were,
                  bringeth in <hi>Timothy</hi> for one; and this
                  adds
                  thus of him,
                
                , that as Histories
                  recorded
                  of him,
                  he was
                  the first Bishop of the Diocess
                  of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Thirdly,
                  by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                
                who in a glance gives
                  him
                  the power and stile of Bishop, where he
                  relateth,
                  , that the Apostle
                  speaking
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> being
                  then a Bishop, doth advise him
                  thus, <hi>Rebuke not an
                  Elder,</hi> c. Fourthly,
                  by <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if the work be his,
                
                who in the preface to his Commentaries
                  on the Epistles
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> thus resolves
                  the point, <hi>Hunc ergo jam creatum Episcopum, instruit
                  per Epistolam;</hi> that being
                  now ordained
                  a Bishop, he was
                  instructed
                  by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle, how to dispose and
                  order the Church of God. Fifthly
                  by <hi>Hierom,</hi> who in his Tract <hi>De
                  Eccles.
                  Scriptoribus,</hi> doth affirm of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                
                <hi>Ephesiorum Episcopum ordinatum  Beato
                  Paulo,</hi> that he was
                  ordained
                  Bishop of the <hi>Ephesians</hi>
                  by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Sixthly,
                  by <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> as in many
                  places,
                  so most significantly
                  and expresly
                  in his Comment on the Epistle to the
                  <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  saying,
                
                <hi>Paul</hi> saith
                  in his Epistle unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> Fulfil thy
                  Ministry, ,
                  being
                  then a Bishop: , for that he
                  was
                  a Bishop appears
                  by <hi>Pauls</hi> writing
                  thus unto him,
                  <hi>Lay hands
                  hastily
                  on no man.</hi> Seventhly,
                  by <hi>Leontius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Magnesia,</hi>
                
                one of the Fathers
                  in the great Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
                  affirming
                  publickly,
                  , that from
                  blessed
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> unto his times,
                  there had
                  been
                  26 Bishops
                  of the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                  Eighthly,
                  by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
                
                where he saith
                  that <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth
                  his Scholar <hi>Timothy, Praelatum gregi,</hi>
                  being
                  now made
                  the Prelate of a Flock, to
                
                
                
                attend to reading.
                
                Ninthly,
                  by <hi>Sedulius</hi> an
                  ancient writer of the <hi>Scotish</hi>
                  Nation, who lived
                  about the middle of the first <hi>Century,</hi>
                  affirming
                  on the credit of old History, <hi>Timotheum
                  istum fuisse Episcopum in Epheso;</hi> that
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> to whom
                  <hi>Paul</hi> wrote,
                  had
                  been
                  Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                
                Tenthly,
                  by <hi>Primasius,</hi> a writer of the first 600
                  years,
                  who in the Preface to his Commentaries
                  on the first to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  gives
                  us this short note, <hi>Timotheus Episcopus fuit, 
                  Discipulus Pauli;</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  was
                  a Bishop, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Disciple: and in his
                  Comment on the Text, saith,
                  that he had
                  the grace or the gift of Prophesie,
                  <hi>cum ordinatione
                  Episcopatus,</hi>
                
                with his ordination to a Bishoprick.
                  11. By the subscription of the second Epistle, where he
                  is
                  called
                  positively,
                  , the first that
                  was
                  ordained
                  Bishop of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi>
                
                12. By <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who
                  giveth
                  this reason of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
                  writing
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> because that in a Church new
                  constitute, , c. it
                  was
                  not easie
                  to inform a Bishop of all things
                  incident unto his place by word of mouth; and further in
                  his Comment on the fourth Chapter of the first Epistle,
                
                doth twice or thrice give <hi>Timothy</hi> the name of
                  Bishop. 13.
                  By <hi>Oecumonius,</hi> whom
                  on these words
                  of the Epistle, <hi>I besought
                  thee
                  to abide still at</hi> Ephesus,
                  gives
                  this gloss or descant; , for there,
                  (or of that place) he ordained
                  him
                  Bishop. An
                  evidence so clear and full, that <hi>Beza,</hi>
                
                though he would not call him
                  Bishop, confesseth
                  him
                  to be President, or , of the
                  <hi>Ephesme</hi> Presbytery, and that he
                  had
                  authority to receive accusations
                  and complaints
                  against a Presbyter, and to judge
                  accordingly.
                  Which what it is
                  else than to be a Bishop, is
                  beyond my fancy to imagine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now for the time in which he was
                  appointed
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (for on the
                  right stating
                  of that point,
                
                
                the clearing
                  of many difficulties
                  doth depend) it may be best gathered
                  from those words
                  in the first Epistle, where <hi>Paul</hi>
                  relates,
                  that he <hi>besought
                  him
                  to abide still at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when he himself
                  went
                  into</hi> Macedonia. Now S. <hi>Pauls</hi> journey into
                  <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which is
                  here intended,
                  is
                  not that mentioned,
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 16. for then there
                  was
                  no Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to be Bishop of.
                
                <hi>Paul</hi> had
                  not then seen
                  <hi>Ephesus</hi> at all, nor planted
                  any Church there till a good while after. Nor could it
                  be when he left <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to go the second time
                  into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> mention whereof
                  is
                  made
                  in the 20 Chapter,
                
                for he had
                  sent
                  <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and <hi>Erastus</hi> before
                  him
                  thither. But it was
                  after he had
                  stayed
                  three months
                  in <hi>Greece,</hi> when hearing
                  that the <hi>Jews
                  laid
                  wait for him
                  as he went
                  about to sail into</hi> Syria, he
                  changed
                  his course, and purposed
                  to return through <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Then
                  was
                  it, as he went
                  that time into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that he
                  brake
                  the business
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> requiring
                  or besseeching him
                  to go to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to set up his
                  aboad
                  in that populous City, and undertake the government of
                  the Church thereof. To which when <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  had
                  condescended,
                
                he was
                  sent
                  before with <hi>Aristarchus</hi> and the rest,
                  tarrying
                  at <hi>Troas</hi> in expectation of the
                  Apostles
                  coming.
                  And there he was
                  most like to be, when the Apostles
                  first Epistle came
                  unto his hands,
                  being
                  written
                  not from <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                
                as the subscription doth pretend, but
                  , out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> doth expresly
                  say in his <hi>Synopsis.</hi> For howsoever the Apostle
                  hoped
                  to come to him
                  shortly,
                  and to instruct him
                  more at large for that weighty business; yet well
                  considering
                  how many lets
                  and hindrances
                  might intervene, he thought it not amiss to prevent the
                  worst, and send that letter of instructions
                  in the mean time to him,
                  that <hi>he might know how to behave himself in the
                  house of God.</hi>
                
                After this time, I find not that the Apostle
                  did
                  employ <hi>Timothy</hi> in any other general service
                  which concerned
                  the Church; or that he called
                  him
                  from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being
                  once got
                  thither, save that he sent
                  for him
                  to make hast
                  to <hi>Rome</hi> immediately
                  on his first coming
                  to that City,
                
                to be assistant to him
                  there in that dangerous exigency. A thing that both the
                  one might crave, and the other do, without
                  detracting
                  any thing at all from the Episcopal place and power
                  which <hi>Timothy</hi> had
                  taken
                  on him:
                  All the Epistles
                  wherein the name of <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  is
                  joyned
                  with <hi>Pauls,</hi> being
                  written
                  within the compass of two years,
                  which was
                  so short an
                  absence from his Pastoral charge, as might be very
                  easily
                  dispensed
                  withal, especially
                  when the publique
                  service of the Church was
                  concerned
                  so highly.
                  I know that some of eminent note,
                
                the better to avoid some appearing
                  difficulties
                  that concern this business, will not have
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> made
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> till after the
                  Apostles
                  coming
                  unto <hi>Rome.</hi> But the second of the two
                  Epistles
                  doth very throughly
                  refute that fancy, in which Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  acquaints
                  him
                  how he had
                  disposed
                  of his retinue;
                
                <hi>Titus</hi> being
                  gone
                  into <hi>Dalmatia, Crescens</hi> to <hi>Galatia,
                  Erastus</hi> taking
                  up his aboad
                  at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus</hi> left at
                  <hi>Miletum</hi> sick; taking
                  great care to have the Cloak and
                  Parchments
                  which were
                  left at <hi>Troas,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  stayed
                  for him,
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20. to be sent
                  speedily
                  unto him.
                  Where by the way, <hi>Miletum,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi>
                  left <hi>Trophimus</hi>
                
                
                sick, was
                  not that Town of lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> unto the which
                  the Elders
                  were
                  called
                  from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for after that we find
                  him
                  at <hi>Hierusalem,
                  Act.</hi> 21.29.
                
                nor was
                  it at the Island called
                  <hi>Mileta,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  thinks,
                  on which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was
                  cast by Shipwrack,
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 28. such alterations
                  or corrections
                  not being
                  easily
                  allowable in holy Scripture. For
                  being
                  that there is
                  in the Isle of <hi>Crete</hi> a Town
                  called
                  <hi>Miletus,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi>
                  testifieth;
                  and that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Voyage from
                  <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  to <hi>Rome,</hi> sailed
                  under <hi>Crete,</hi> and hovered
                  for a while about that coast, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.7, 8.
                  <hi>c.</hi> that is
                  most like to be the place, and there I leave
                  him.
              </p>
              <p>
                For being
                  thus fallen
                  on the Coast of <hi>Crete,</hi>
                
                I think it seasonable to enquire
                  some news
                  of <hi>Titus:</hi> whom
                  the Apostle much about the time that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  undertook
                  the charge of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                  had
                  made
                  the Bishop of this Island. <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  thinks,
                
                and not improbably,
                  that at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> last
                  going
                  out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> when he
                  had
                  gone
                  over those parts,
                  and given
                  them
                  much exhortation, and having
                  so done,
                  went
                  into <hi>Greece;</hi> that this his
                  going
                  into <hi>Greece</hi> was
                  by and through the <hi>Aegean</hi> sea; that in his
                  passage thither he put in at <hi>Crete:</hi> And
                  finally,
                  that he left <hi>Titus</hi> here, <hi>ad curandam
                  Ecclesiam,</hi> whom
                  he made
                  Bishop for that purpose. This is
                  most like to be the time, the circumstances
                  of the Text and story so well agreeing
                  thereunto; for till this time, <hi>Titus</hi>
                  was
                  either attendant on S. <hi>Paul</hi> in person, or
                  sent
                  from place to place on his occasions
                  and dispatches;
                  as may appear by looking
                  on the concordances
                  of holy Scripture.
                  Now that <hi>Titus</hi> was
                  ordained
                  the first Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi>
                  hath
                  been
                  affirmed
                  by several Authors
                  of good both credit and antiquity. For first,
                
                <hi>Eusebius</hi> making
                  a Catalogue
                  of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> assistants,
                  or fellow-labourers,
                  and reckoning
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> amongst them,
                  whom
                  he recordeth
                  for the first Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                  adds
                  presently,
                  , and so was
                  <hi>Titus</hi> also, the first Bishop of <hi>Crete.</hi>
                
                Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the Preface to his
                  Commentaries,
                  on the Epistle unto <hi>Titus,</hi> doth affirm as much,
                  <hi>Titum Apostolus consecravit Episcopum,</hi> the
                  Apostle consecrated
                  <hi>Titus</hi> a Bishop, and therefore doth admonish
                  him
                  to be solicitous for the well ordering
                  of the Church committed
                  to him.
                  Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> writing
                  on these words
                  in that Epistle,
                
                <hi>For this cause left I thee
                  in</hi> Crete, <hi>c.</hi> doth apply
                  them
                  thus, <hi>Audiant Episcopi qui habent constituendi
                  Presbyteres per singulas urbes potestatem,</hi> Let
                  Bishops
                  mark this well who have authority to ordain
                  Presbyters
                  in every City, on what conditions,
                  to what persons
                  (for that I take to be his meaning)
                  Ecclesiastical orders
                  are to be conferred.
                  Which is
                  a strong insinuation, that <hi>Titus</hi>
                  having
                  that authority, must be needs
                  a Bishop. More evidently
                  in his Catalogue of Writers,
                  or in <hi>Sophronius</hi> at the least,
                
                if those few names
                  were
                  by him
                  added
                  to that Catalogue. <hi>Titus Episcopus Cretae,
                  Titus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Crete</hi>
                  did
                  preach the Gospel both in that and the adjacent
                  Islands.
                
                <hi>Theodoret</hi> proposing
                  first this question, why <hi>Paul</hi> should rather
                  write to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> than to
                  <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi>
                  returns
                  this answer to the same, that <hi>Luke</hi> and
                  <hi>Silas</hi> were
                  still with him,
                  , but those
                  had
                  entrusted
                  with the government
                  of Churches.
                  But more particularly
                  <hi>Titus,</hi> a famous Disciple of Saint
                  <hi>Paul,</hi>
                
                , was
                  by him
                  ordained
                  Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> being
                  a place of great extent; with a Commission also to
                  ordain Bishops
                  under him.
                
                <hi>Theophylact</hi> in his preface
                  unto this Epistle, doth affirm the same;
                  using
                  almost his very words.
                  And <hi>Oecumenius</hi>
                  on the Text doth declare as much,
                  saying,
                  that <hi>Paul</hi> gave
                  <hi>Titus</hi> authority of ordaining
                  Bishops,
                  <hi>Crete</hi> being
                  of too large a quantity to be committed
                  unto one alone, ,
                  having
                  first consecrate or made
                  him
                  Bishop. Finally,
                  the subscription of this Epistle
                  calls
                  <hi>Titus</hi> the first Bishop of the Church of the
                  <hi>Cretians;</hi>
                  which evidence, though questioned
                  now of late, is
                  of good Authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                For some of late, who are not willing that Antiquity
                  should afford such grounds,
                
                for <hi>Titus</hi> being
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Crete,</hi> have amongst
                  other arguments
                  devised
                  against it, found an
                  irreparable flaw, as they conceive, in this
                  Subscription. <hi>Beza,</hi>
                
                who herein led
                  the way, disproves
                  the whole Subscription as supposititious, because it
                  is
                  there said,
                  that it was
                  written
                  from <hi>Nieopolis</hi> of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> A thing,
                  saith
                  he, which cannot be, for the Apostle doth not say,
                  , <hi>I will winter here,</hi> but
                  , <hi>illic,</hi> I will winter
                  there; and therefore he was
                  somewhere else when he wrote
                  this Epistle. But <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who
                  lived
                  neerer
                  the Apostles
                  times,
                
                affirms
                  it to be written
                  from <hi>Nicopolis;</hi> and so doth <hi>Hierome</hi> in
                  his Preface unto that Epistle. The
                  <hi>Syriack</hi>
                  translation dates
                  it also thence, as is
                  confessed
                  by them
                  that adhere to <hi>Beza. Theophylact</hi> and
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> agree herein with
                  <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the ancient
                  Copies.
                  As for the criticism it is
                  neither here nor there; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  being
                  still in motion, might appoint <hi>Titus</hi> to repair
                  unto <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> letting
                  him
                  understand that howsoever he disposed
                
                
                
                of himself in the mean time, yet he
                  intended
                  <hi>there to Winter;</hi> and so he might well say,
                  though he was
                  at <hi>Nicopolis</hi> when he writ the same. That
                  <hi>Titus</hi> is
                  there called
                  the first Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi>
                
                or of the Church of the <hi>Cretians,</hi>
                  is
                  another hint, that some have taken
                  to vilifie
                  the credit of the said
                  Subscription; asking
                  if ever there were
                  such a second Bishop? Assuredly,
                  the Realm of <hi>England</hi> is
                  as fair and large a circuit, as the Isle of
                  <hi>Crete.</hi> And yet I do not find it
                  used
                  as argument, that <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi>
                  had
                  neither any hand in the converting
                  of the <hi>English,</hi> or was
                  not the first Archbishop of the See of
                  <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
                
                because it is
                  affirmed
                  in <hi>Beda</hi>'s History, <hi>Archiepiscopus
                  genti Anglorum ordinatus est,</hi> that he
                  was
                  ordained
                  the Archbishop of the <hi>English</hi>
                  Nation.
                
                And for an
                  answer to the question, we need but look into
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> where we shall find <hi>Pinytus</hi>
                  a right godly man, called
                  in plain terms
                  Bishop of <hi>Crete; Cretae Episcopus,</hi>
                  saith
                  the <hi>Latin,</hi> , as the
                  <hi>Greek</hi> Original: the self-same stile, which
                  is
                  excepted
                  at in <hi>Titus.</hi> Now, whereas it
                  is
                  said,
                  that <hi>Titus</hi> was
                  left no otherwise in <hi>Crete,</hi> than as
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> Vicar General, Commissary, or
                  Substitute,
                  to order those things
                  in such sort as he had
                  appointed,
                  which he could not dispatch
                  himself, when he was
                  there present; this can by no means
                  be admitted:
                  the Rules
                  prescribed
                  unto him,
                  and <hi>Timothy,</hi> being
                  for the most part of that nature, as do agree with the
                  condition of perpetual Governours,
                  and not of temporary and removable
                  Substitutes.
                  As for the anticipation of the time, which I see some
                  use, relating
                  that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  having
                  passed
                  through <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to confirm
                  the Churches,
                  did
                  from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> pass over into <hi>Crete;</hi>
                  where the Apostle having
                  preached
                  the Gospel, left <hi>Titus</hi> for a while to set
                  things
                  in Order: although I cannot easily
                  tell on what Authority the report
                  is
                  built,
                  yet I can easily
                  discern that it can hardly
                  stand with Scripture. We read indeed in the 15. Chapter
                  of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  that he went
                  <hi>thorow
                  Syria and Cilicia confirming
                  the Churches;
                  ver.
                  ult.</hi> and in the first words
                  of the following
                  Chapter,
                
                we find him
                  at <hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Lystra</hi>
                  Cities
                  of <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> the very next Province to
                  <hi>Cilicia</hi> Northward, from which it
                  is
                  divided
                  by a branch of the Mountain <hi>Taurus.</hi> Now whether
                  of the two it be more probable, that <hi>Paul</hi>
                  should pass immediately
                  from <hi>Cilicia</hi> unto <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> upon the
                  usual common Road; or fetch a voyage into
                  <hi>Crete,</hi>
                
                as these men
                  suppose, and be transported
                  back again into <hi>Lycaonia,</hi>
                  being
                  an
                  in-land Countrey
                  far from any Sea, (which could not be without some
                  Miracle, or great <hi>hiatus</hi> in the story) I leave
                  to any man to be imagined.
              </p>
              <p>
                <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
                  being
                  thus setled
                  in their Episcopal Sees,
                
                we must pass on, to see if we can meet with any other of
                  Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Disciples,
                  or his assistants
                  if you will, that were
                  entrusted
                  with the like Authority. And first we meet with
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi>
                  ordained
                  by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (as is
                  most likely) the first Bishop of <hi>Athens;</hi> but
                  howsoever, questionless ordained
                  the first Bishop there. Another <hi>Dionysius,</hi>
                  Bishop of
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                
                who in all probability was
                  born whilst Saint <hi>John</hi>
                  was
                  living,
                  doth expresly
                  say it: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Dionysius</hi> the
                  <hi>Areopagite</hi> being
                  converted
                  to the Faith by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  , was
                  first ordained
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Athens.</hi> The foresaid
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> doth also
                  tell us,
                
                that <hi>Publius</hi> succeeded
                  the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> after him
                  <hi>Quadratus;</hi> both which were
                  Disciples
                  of the Apostles:
                  the former of the two, being
                  conceived
                  to be the same,
                
                whose Father, <hi>Paul</hi> cured
                  so miraculously,
                  in the Isle of <hi>Malta.</hi> Next for the Church of
                  <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
                
                the <hi>Martyrologies</hi>
                  inform us that <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> one of
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> Companions,
                  <hi>ab eodem Apostolo Thessalonicensium Episcopus
                  ordinatus,</hi> was
                  by him
                  ordained
                  Bishop of the <hi>Thessalonians.</hi>
                  And after him
                  succeeded
                  <hi>Caius,</hi> whom
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentioned
                  in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                
                by the name of <hi>Gaius, the Host,</hi> as he
                  calls
                  him,
                  <hi>of the whole Church.</hi> Certain I
                  am,
                  that <hi>Origen</hi> reports
                  him
                  to be Bishop here, and that upon the
                  known
                  tradition of his Elders.
                  <hi>Fertur sane ex traditione
                  majorum, quod hic</hi> Gaius <hi>Episcopus fuerit
                  Thessalonicensis Ecclesiae,</hi> as his own
                  words
                  are. So for the Church of the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath
                  told
                  us of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> one
                  whom
                  he mentioneth
                  oftentimes,
                
                in his Epistle to that people, that he
                  was
                  not only his <hi>Brother,</hi>
                  and <hi>Companion</hi> in labour, and his
                  Fellow-souldier;
                  <hi>Vestrum autem
                  Apostolum,</hi> but he was
                  also their Apostle.
                
                Ask of <hi>Theodoret</hi> what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there
                  meaneth,
                  and he will tell you that he was
                  their Bishop. For in his Comment on the first to
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> he gives
                  this note, <hi>Eos qui nunc vocantur Episcopi,
                  nominabant Apostolos,</hi> that in those
                  times
                  in which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ that Epistle, those
                  who are now called
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  were
                  called
                  <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  And this he proves
                  out of this passage of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that so, in
                  this respect, <hi>[ita Philippensium Apostolus erat
                  Epaphroditus] Epaphroditus</hi>
                  is
                  called
                  the <hi>Apostle</hi>
                  of the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
                  Which clearly
                  sheweth,
                  that in his opinion, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>
                
                
                was
                  Bishop of the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  as <hi>Titus</hi> of the <hi>Cretans,</hi>
                  and <hi>Timothy</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  in whom
                  he afterwards
                  doth instance. <hi>Beza</hi> indeed doth render the
                  <hi>Greek</hi> word , by the
                  <hi>Latin, Legatus;</hi> in which he
                  hath
                  been
                  followed
                  by the latter English, who read it <hi>Messenger.</hi>
                  But <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not only keep himself to the
                  old Translation,
                
                though he take notice of the other; but he
                  prefers
                  the old before it; <hi>Sed prior sensus melis
                  convenit,</hi> as more agreeable unto the
                  meaning
                  of the place. For the <hi>Colossians</hi>
                  next; we find the names
                  of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and <hi>Archippus,</hi> their two
                  first Bishops,
                  in the Epistle to that Church. And first for
                  <hi>Epaphras,</hi> it is
                  conceived
                  that he first preached
                  the Faith of Christ to the <hi>Colossians:</hi>
                  And this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth seem to intimate in
                  the first Chapter of the same Epistle,
                  saying,
                
                <hi>As ye also learned
                  of</hi> Epaphras <hi>our dear fellow
                  servant.</hi> Certain it is,
                  that in the <hi>Martyrologies,</hi>
                  he is
                  affirmed
                  to be the Bishop of this Church, <hi>ab eodem Apostolo
                  ordinatus,</hi>
                
                and that he was
                  ordained
                  Bishop by the hands
                  of <hi>Paul.</hi> But being
                  after Prisoner with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,
                  Archippus</hi> undertook
                  the Episcopal charge,
                
                whom
                  <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth
                  to <hi>take heed unto the Ministery
                  which he had
                  received
                  of the Lord, and to fulfil it.</hi> Most sure I
                  am,
                  that <hi>Ambrose</hi> writing
                  on those words,
                  doth make <hi>Archippus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Colossi,</hi>
                  by the name of their <hi>Praepositus,</hi>
                
                or Governour,
                  of which see before: adding
                  withal that after <hi>Epaphras</hi>
                  had
                  seasoned
                  them
                  in the Truth of God, <hi>hic accepit regendam eorum
                  Ecclesiam, Archippus</hi> took
                  the Government
                  of that Church upon him.
              </p>
              <p>
                For other of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
                  Disciples,
                  we find in <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> if he may be
                  credited,
                
                that <hi>Silas, Pauls</hi> most individual Companion,
                
                was
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> the truth
                  whereof shall be examined
                  more at large, in the second Century: and that
                  <hi>Sosipater,</hi> mention of whom
                  is
                  made,
                  <hi>Acts</hi>
                  20, was
                  ordained
                  Bishop of <hi>Iconium,</hi> wherein
                  <hi>Hippolitus</hi> concurring
                  with him,
                  doth make the matter the more probable. Of
                  <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> (of whom
                  see <hi>Acts</hi>
                  18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) the same two
                  Authors
                  do report, that he was
                  Bishop of <hi>Colophon,</hi> one of the
                  Cities
                  of the lesser <hi>Asia.</hi> But
                  leaving
                  these more Eastern Countreys,
                  let us look homeward towards
                  the <hi>West.</hi> And there we find that
                  <hi>Crescens,</hi> whom
                  Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> at his first
                  coming
                  unto <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                had
                  sent
                  into <hi>Galatia</hi> to confirm
                  the Churches;
                  was
                  after by him
                  sent
                  on the like occasion into <hi>Gaule,</hi>
                  or <hi>Gallia,</hi> there to preach the Gospel: for so I
                  rather chuse
                  to atone the business, than correct the Text, and read
                  it <hi>Crescens in Galliam</hi> with
                  <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
                
                For having
                  with so good success been
                  employed
                  formerly
                  in <hi>Galatia;</hi> he might with better comfort
                  undertake the service of Preaching
                  Christ unto the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
                  whereof the <hi>Galatians</hi>
                  were
                  a branch or Colony. Now that he
                  did
                  indeed Preach Christs Gospel there,
                  is
                  affirmed
                  positively
                  both by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> two
                  very eminent and ancient Writers:
                
                and <hi>Ado Viennensis,</hi> a Writer though of lesser
                  standing,
                  yet of good repute, affirmeth
                  that he was
                  put upon this employment, <hi>quo tempore Paulus in
                  Hispnias pervenisse creditur,</hi> at such time
                  as it is
                  conceived
                  that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> went
                  into <hi>Spain,</hi> which was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 61. as <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  thinketh,
                  there being
                  left, and having
                  planted
                  a Church of Christ, in the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> (now
                  in that Province which is
                  called
                  <hi>Daulphine</hi>) he became
                  the first Bishop of the same; <hi>Primus
                  ejusdem
                  Civitatis Episcopus,</hi> saith
                  the <hi>Martyrologie.</hi>
                
                And to this, <hi>Ado,</hi> one of his
                  successors,
                  also doth agree; adding
                  withal, that after he had
                  sat there some few years,
                  he returned
                  back again into <hi>Galatia,</hi>
                  leaving
                  one <hi>Zacharias</hi> to succeed
                  him.
                  Finally,
                  not to leave out <hi>Britain,</hi> it
                  is
                  recorded
                  in the <hi>Greek Menologies,</hi>
                  that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> (whom
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks
                  of <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.) <hi>being
                  one of the Seventy,
                  and afterwards
                  a follower of Saint</hi> Paul,
                
                <hi>was
                  by him
                  ordained
                  Bishop of Britain</hi> (, <hi>as the
                  words
                  there are) a region full of fierce and savage people;
                  and that having
                  there setled
                  the Church, and ordained</hi>
                  Presbyters
                  <hi>and</hi> Deacons
                  <hi>in the same, he did
                  there also end his life.</hi> The Reverend
                  Primate of
                  <hi>Armagh,</hi> out of a fragment
                  attributed
                  to <hi>Heleca,</hi>
                
                sometimes
                  Bishop of <hi>Saragossa</hi>
                  in <hi>Spain,</hi> doth recite a passage, wherein it
                  is
                  affirmed
                  of this <hi>Aristobulus, missum in Angliam
                  Episcopum,</hi> that he was
                  sent
                  Bishop into <hi>England,</hi> for so the Author
                  calleth
                  this Countrey
                  according
                  to the name it had
                  when he writ the same. But these
                  things
                  which relate to the <hi>British</hi>
                  Churches,
                  I rather shall refer to our learned
                  Antiquaries,
                  to be considered
                  of more fully;
                  than affirm any thing my self.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to look back on <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
                
                whom
                  we left lately
                  in their several Churches,
                  I hear it said,
                  that notwithstanding all those proofs
                  before produced
                  from the ancient, yet being
                  Evangelists,
                  as they were,
                  they could be no <hi>Bishops:</hi>
                
                <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  being
                  tied
                  to the particular care of that flock or Church, over
                  which God had
                  made
                  them
                  Overseers;
                  but the Evangelists
                  being
                  Planetary, sent
                  up and down from place to place, by the
                  Apostles,
                  as the necessities
                  of the Church required.
                  Besides
                  that moving
                
                
                
                in an
                  higher
                  sphere than that of <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  and being
                  Co-partners
                  with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Apostleship or
                  Apostolical function,
                
                it had
                  been
                  a devesting
                  of themselves of their Apostolical
                  jurisdiction, and preheminence,
                  to become <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  at the last, and so descend from a
                  superiour
                  to an
                  inferiour
                  Office. For answer whereunto we need say but this, that
                  the gift of being
                  an
                  Evangelist, might, and did
                  fall on any rank of ordinary Ministers,
                  as might that also of the Prophet. <hi>Philip</hi> one
                  of the seven, a <hi>Deacon,</hi> as it
                  is
                  generally
                  conceived,
                  but howsoever Ministring
                  unto the Church, in an
                  inferiour
                  place or Office, was
                  notwithstanding an
                  Evangelist: and <hi>Agabus,</hi> though perhaps but a
                  simple Presbyter, one of the Seventy past all question,
                  was
                  a Prophet too. <hi>Philip,</hi> as he
                  was
                  one of the Seven, was
                  tied
                  to a particular employment, and of necessity,
                  sometimes,
                
                must <hi>leave the Word of God to serve
                  Tables.</hi>
                  Yet the same <hi>Philip,</hi> as he
                  was
                  furnished
                  by the Lord with gifts
                  and graces
                  for gaining
                  Souls
                  to God Almighty, and doing
                  the work of an
                  Evangelist, must leave the <hi>serving
                  of those Tables</hi>
                  to preach the Word. And <hi>Agabus,</hi>
                
                if he were
                  a Presbyter, whether of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  from whence he is
                  twice said
                  to come, or of some other Church, that I will not say,
                  might notwithstanding his employment in a particular
                  Church, repair to <hi>Antioch,</hi> or
                  <hi>Caesarea,</hi> as the Spirit
                  willed
                  him,
                  there to discharge the Office of a Prophet. So then both
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> might be
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  as to their ordinary place and calling;
                  though in relation unto
                  their extraordinary gifts,
                  they were
                  both Evangelists.
                  As for their falling
                  from a higher,
                  to a lower function, from an
                  Evangelist unto a <hi>Bishop;</hi> I cannot
                  possibly
                  perceive
                  where the fall should be. They that object this, will
                  not say, but <hi>Timothy,</hi> at the least,
                  was
                  made
                  a Presbyter, for wherefore else
                  did
                  the Presbytery (which they so much stand on) <hi>lay
                  hands
                  upon him.</hi>
                  And certainly,
                  if it were
                  no diminution from an
                  Evangelist to become a I resbyter; it
                  was
                  a preferment unto the Evangelist, from
                  being
                  but a Presbyter to become a <hi>Bishop.</hi> But for the
                  <hi>Bishopping
                  of Timothy and Titus,</hi> as to the <hi>quod sit</hi>
                  of it, that so they were,
                  in the opinion of all ancient Writers,
                  we have said
                  enough. We will next look on the authority
                  committed
                  to them,
                  to see what further proof hereof may be
                  brought
                  for that.

                THEY who object that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
                  were
                  Evangelists;
                
                and so by consequence
                  no Bishops,
                
                have also said,
                  and left in writing,
                  that the authority committed
                  to them
                  by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> did
                  not belong to them
                  at all, as <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  but <hi>Evangelists</hi>
                
                
                only. But this, if pondered
                  as it ought, hath
                  no ground to stand on. The calling
                  of Evangelists,
                  as it was
                  Extraordinary, so it was
                  but temporary, to last no longer,
                  than the first planting
                  of the Church, for which so many signal
                  gifts
                  and graces
                  of the Holy Spirit, were
                  at first poured
                  on the Disciples.
                  I know not any Orthodox Writer, who doth not in this
                  point agree with <hi>Calvin:</hi>
                
                who in his Comment on the Epistle to the
                  <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  gives
                  us this instruction, <hi>Deum Apostolis, Evangelistis
                   Prophetis, Ecclesiam suam non nisi ad tempus
                  ornasse,</hi> that God adorned
                  his Church with Prophets,
                  Evangelists
                  and Apostles,
                  for a season only: having
                  before observed,
                  that of all those holy ministrations
                  there recited,
                  <hi>Postrema tantum duo perpetua esse,</hi> the two
                  last, (<hi>viz.</hi> Pastors
                  and Teachers,
                  which he takes
                  for two) were
                  to be perpetual. But on the other side, power to ordain
                  fit Ministers,
                  of what sort soever, as also to reprove and censure
                  those that behaved
                  themselves unworthily;
                  authority to convent
                  and reject an
                  Heretick,
                  to punish by the censures
                  of the Church, all such as give offence and scandal to
                  the Congregation by their exhorbitant
                  and unruly living:
                  this ought to be perpetual in the Church of Christ. This
                  the Apostle seems
                  to intimate,
                  when he said
                  to <hi>Timothy, I charge thee
                  in the sight of God,</hi>
                
                <hi>and before Jesus Christ, that thou keep this
                  Commandment without spot, and unreprovable, until the
                  appearing
                  of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Now <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  was
                  not like to live till Christs second
                  coming;
                  the Apostle, past all question, never
                  meant
                  it so: therefore the power, and charge here
                  given
                  to exercise the same, according
                  to the Apostles
                  Rules
                  and Precepts
                  was
                  not personal only: but such as was
                  to appertain to him,
                  and to his successours
                  for ever, even till the appearing
                  of our Lord and Saviour. The like expression do we find
                  in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> when our Redeemer
                  said
                  unto his Apostles,
                
                <hi>Behold I am
                  with you always
                  even unto the end of the world,</hi> Not
                  always
                  certainly
                  with his Apostles,
                  not to the <hi>end of the World</hi> with those very
                  men,
                  to whom
                  he did
                  address himself when he spake
                  these words;
                  for they being
                  mortal men
                  have been
                  dead long since. <hi>Non solis hoc Apostolis dictum
                  esse,</hi> this was
                  no personal promise then, saith
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> truly.
                
                With them
                  and their successours
                  he might <hi>always</hi>
                  be, and to the <hi>end of the world</hi> give
                  them
                  his assistance. <hi>Cum vobis  successorlbus
                  vestris,</hi> as <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Carthusian</hi>
                  very well observeth.
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then gives
                  this charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in
                  him
                  unto all his successors
                  in the Episcopal function; which should continue in the
                  Church till Christs second coming.
                  And therefore I conceive the annotation of the
                  <hi>ordinary gloss</hi> to be sound and good, <hi>in
                  Timotheo omnibus successoribus loquitur Apostolus,</hi>
                
                that this was
                  spoke
                  in <hi>Timothy</hi> unto all his
                  successors.
                  And so the Commentaries
                  under the name of <hi>Ambrose</hi> do inform us also,
                  saying,
                  that <hi>Paul</hi> was
                  not so solicitous for <hi>Timothy,</hi> as for his
                  successors,
                  <hi>ut exemplo Timothei
                  Ecclesiae ordinationem custodirent:</hi>
                
                that they might learn by his Example (<hi>i.e.</hi> by
                  practising
                  those directions
                  which were
                  given
                  to him)
                  to look unto the ordering
                  of the Church.
              </p>
              <p>
                This ground thus laid,
                
                we must next look on the authority which the Apostle
                  gave
                  to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and in
                  them
                  to all other Bishops.
                  And the best way to look upon it
                  is,
                  to divide the same as the <hi>School-men</hi>
                  do, into <hi>potestas ordinis,</hi> and
                  <hi>potestas
                  jurisdictionis;</hi> the power of Order, and the power
                  of <hi>jurisdiction:</hi> in each of which there occur
                  divers
                  things
                  to be considered.
                  First, for the power of Order, besides
                  what every Bishop doth, and may
                  lawfully
                  perform, by vertue
                  of the Orders
                  he received
                  as Presbyter; there is
                  a power of Order conferred
                  upon him
                  as a Bishop: and that's indeed the power of
                  <hi>Ordination,</hi> or giving
                  Orders,
                  which seems
                  so proper and peculiar to the Bishops
                  Office, as not to be communicable to any else.
                  <hi>Paul</hi> gives
                  it as a special charge to <hi>Timothy, to lay
                  hands
                  hastily
                  on no man:</hi>
                
                which caution doubtless
                  had
                  been
                  given
                  in vain, in case the Presbyters
                  of <hi>Ephesus</hi> might have done
                  it, as well as he. And <hi>Titus</hi>
                  seems
                  to have been
                  left in <hi>Crete</hi> for this purpose
                  chiefly,
                
                that he might ordain Presbyters
                  <hi>in every City:</hi> which questionless
                  had
                  been
                  unnecessary, in case an
                  ordinary Presbyter might have done
                  the same. The Fathers
                  have observed
                  from these Texts
                  of Scripture, that none but Bishops
                  strictly
                  and properly
                  so called
                  (according
                  as the word was
                  used
                  when they lived
                  that said
                  it) have any power of <hi>Ordination.
                  Epiphanius</hi> in his dispute against <hi>Aerius,</hi>
                
                observes
                  this difference betwixt Bishops
                  and Presbyters,
                  (whom
                  the Heretick
                  would fain have had
                  to be the same) that the Presbyter by
                  administring
                  the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism,</hi>
                  did
                  beget children
                  to the Church: but that the Bishop by the power of
                  <hi>Ordination,</hi> ,
                  did
                  beget Fathers
                  to the same. A power from which he
                  utterly
                  excludes the Presbyter; and gives
                  good reason for it too: for how,
                  saith
                  he, can he ordain, or constitute a Presbyter,
                  , which in his Ordination
                
                
                
                did
                  receive no power to impose hands
                  upon another:
                
                <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaking
                  of the difference
                  between a Bishop, and a Presbyter,
                  makes
                  it consist in nothing else, but in this power of
                  <hi>Ordination.</hi> , c.
                  <hi>only in laying
                  on of hands,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>or in Ordination, a Bishop
                  is
                  before, or above a Presbyter; and have that power only
                  inherent in them,</hi>
                
                <hi>which the others have not. Hierom</hi> although a
                  great advancer of the place and Office of the Presbyter,
                  excludes him
                  from the power of Ordination, or any interest therein.
                  <hi>Quid enim facit excepta ordinatione
                  Episcopus, quod Presbyter non faciat?</hi> What,
                  saith
                  he, doth a Bishop, saving
                  Ordination, more than a Presbyter may do? Neither doth
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> speak <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de
                  jure, quid facit,</hi> not <hi>quid debet facere:</hi>
                
                as I observe the place to be both
                  cited
                  and applyed
                  in some late Discourses.
                  <hi>Hierom's non faciat,</hi> is
                  as good as <hi>non debet facere:</hi> and they that look
                  upon him
                  well, will find he pleads
                  not of the possession only, but the right and Title. And
                  we may see his meaning
                  by the passage formerly
                  alledged
                  upon the words
                  of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi>
                  5. <hi>Audiant Episcopi qui habent constituendi
                  Presbyteros per singulas urbes potestatem.</hi> By which
                  it seems
                  that Bishops
                  only had
                  the power of ordaining
                  Presbyters;
                  and that they did
                  both claim, and enjoy the same from this grant to
                  <hi>Titus.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                For further clearing
                  of this point,
                
                there are two things
                  to be declared
                  and made
                  evident, first, that the power of Ordination
                  was
                  so inherent in the person of a Bishop, that he alone
                  both might and did
                  sometimes
                  ordain, without help of Presbyters:
                  and secondly,
                  that the Presbyters
                  might not do the same without the Bishop. And first,
                  that anciently
                  the Bishops
                  of the Church both might, and did
                  ordain, without the help or co-assistance of the
                  Presbyters,
                
                appeareth
                  by the ordination of <hi>Origen</hi>
                  unto the
                  Office of a Presbyter by <hi>Theoctistus</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  who laid
                  hands
                  upon him;
                  , as my Author
                  hath
                  it. Which act of theirs when it
                  was
                  quarrelled
                  by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he did
                  not plead in bar, that there were
                  no Presbyters
                  assistant in it; but that the party
                  had
                  done
                  somewhat (and we know what 'twas) by which he
                  was
                  conceived
                  to be uncapable of holy Orders.
                
                So when the Bishop, whosoever he
                  was,
                  out of an
                  affectation
                  which he bare unto <hi>Novatus</hi> (not
                  being
                  yet a Separatist from the Church of God)
                  desired,
                  , the Clergy
                  being
                  all against it, to ordain him
                  Presbyter: the matter stood
                  upon, as the story testifieth,
                  was
                  not the Bishops
                  being
                  the sole agent in it, but because it
                  was
                  forbidden
                  by the ancient Canons,
                  that any one who had
                  been
                  formerly
                  baptized
                  being
                  sick in bed, (and that had
                  been
                  <hi>Novatus</hi> case) should be
                  assumed
                  into the Clergy. But not to make a
                  further
                  search into particulars,
                  which are vast and infinite: we have two notable
                  cases
                  that reflect this way, and in them
                  two such general Maxims
                  as will make all sure. In the third Council of
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> holden
                  in or about the year 390. it was
                  proposed
                  by <hi>Aurelius</hi> then Metropolitan of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                
                that it might be lawful for him
                  to chuse
                  or take Presbyters
                  out of the Churches
                  of his Suffragans,
                  and to ordain them
                  Bishops
                  of such Cities
                  as were
                  unprovided:
                  and that the Bishops
                  of those Churches,
                  whose Clerks,
                  or Presbyters
                  they were,
                  might not be suffered
                  to oppose. To which when all the
                  Fathers
                  had
                  agreed.
                  <hi>Posthumianus</hi> one of the
                  Prelates
                  there assembled,
                  puts
                  this case, that if a Bishop had
                  but one Presbyter only, <hi>Numquid debet illi ipse unus
                  Presbyter auferri,</hi> whether that one Presbyter
                  should be taken
                  from him.
                  <hi>Aurelius</hi> thereunto replyeth,
                  <hi>Episcopum unum esse posse, per quem
                  dignatione
                  divina Presbyteri multi
                  constitui possunt,</hi> that a Bishop by
                  Gods
                  grace might make many Presbyters,
                  and therefore that on such occasions,
                  his one and only Presbyter must be
                  yielded
                  up upon demand. By which it is
                  most clear and evident, that a Bishop may alone perform
                  the Act or Ceremony of <hi>Ordination,</hi> not
                  having
                  any Presbyter at all to join with
                  him
                  in it. The like occurreth
                  in the second Council of <hi>Sevil</hi>
                  (held
                  in the year 617, or thereabouts)
                  concerning
                  <hi>Erangitanus</hi> a Presbyter of the Church of
                  <hi>Corduba,</hi> who by the Bishop of that See,
                
                (a ruffling
                  Prelate, as appeareth
                  by the following
                  Chapter) had
                  been
                  deposed
                  from his Ministry: the cause being
                  brought
                  before the Council, and the whole process
                  openly
                  declared
                  unto them,
                  the man was
                  presently
                  restored
                  to his Orders,
                  and the sentence passed
                  against him
                  declared
                  to be irrregular, and contrary to the ancient
                  Canons,
                  whereby it
                  was
                  enacted
                  that no Clergy-man should be deposed
                  without the judgment
                  of a Synod. And then it followeth,
                  <hi>Episcopus sacerdotibus  ministris solus dare
                  honorem potest,
                  auferre solus non potest;</hi> that
                  Bishops
                  solely
                  of themselves may confer holy Orders
                  on Priests
                  and Deacons,
                  but solely
                  of their own authority, they could not depose
                  them.

                So then it is
                  most clear and evident,
                
                that Bishops
                  might and did
                  ordain, without their Presbyters,
                  might not the Presbyters
                  do the like sometimes,
                  without their Bishop?
                
                
                Certainly
                  nothing less than so: or if they
                  did
                  attempt it at any time, the whole act
                  was
                  not only censured
                  and condemned
                  as uncanonical, but adjudged
                  void and null, from the first beginning.
                  For besides
                  that which hath
                  been
                  said
                  before, from <hi>Hierom, Chrysostom,</hi> and
                  <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> touching
                  the limitation of this power to the
                  Bishops
                  only; there are three <hi>Book-cases</hi>
                  in the point, which put the matter out of question:
                  <hi>Coluthus,</hi> once a Presbyter of
                  <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                
                falling
                  at difference with his Bishop, usurps
                  upon the Bishops
                  Office, and ordains
                  certain Presbyters,
                  himself being
                  one. This business being
                  canvassed
                  in the Council of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before that
                  famous <hi>Confessor Hosius,</hi> and other
                  Bishops
                  there assembled:
                  <hi>Coluthus</hi> was
                  commanded
                  to carry himself for a Presbyter only, as indeed he
                  was:
                  and all the Presbyters
                  of his ordaining
                  reduced
                  to the same condition, , in which
                  they were
                  before the said
                  <hi>Ordination.</hi> Where by the way instead of
                  <hi>Coluthus</hi> the last edition of this Author in
                  <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> doth read
                  <hi>Catholicus:</hi>
                
                which must be mended
                  as before, in the relation of this story;
                
                where we have <hi>Coluthus,</hi>
                  and not <hi>Catholicus.</hi> But to proceed. It
                  hapned
                  afterwards
                  that <hi>Ischyras</hi> one of the
                  <hi>Pseudo-Presbyters</hi>
                  ordained
                  by <hi>Coluthus,</hi>
                
                accused
                  <hi>Macarius</hi> (one of the Presbyters
                  of <hi>Athanasius</hi>) for a pretended
                  violence to be offered
                  to him,
                
                then ministring
                  at the holy Table. So that the business
                  being
                  brought
                  at last unto the judgment
                  of a Council; and the point in issue
                  being
                  this, whether this <hi>Ischyras</hi>
                  were
                  a Presbyter, or not; and so by consequence a dispenser
                  of those sacred Mysteries:
                  he was
                  returned
                  no Presbyter, by the full consent of all the
                  Prelates
                  then assembled.
                  The reason was,
                  because he was
                  ordained
                  by <hi>Coluthus,</hi> , who
                  died
                  a Presbyter; and that his Ordinations
                  had
                  been
                  all made
                  void, and those that had
                  received
                  them
                  at his hands,
                  , became
                  lay again, and in that state received
                  the blessed
                  Sacrament as the Lay-men
                  did.
                  And this saith
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> was
                  a thing so publique,
                  , that no man ever
                  doubted
                  of the truth thereof.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second case was
                  that of <hi>Maximus,</hi>
                
                once a familiar friend of <hi>Gregory
                  Nazianzens,</hi>
                  at such time as he was
                  Bishop of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and by
                  him,
                
                having
                  taken
                  a good liking
                  to him,
                  admitted
                  into the Clergy of that Church. But <hi>Maximus</hi>
                  being
                  an
                  ungrateful wretch, complots
                  with others like himself, to be
                  made
                  Bishop of that City: and thereupon
                  negotiates
                  with <hi>Peter,</hi> then Patriarch of
                  <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to ordain him
                  Bishop of the same; which being
                  done
                  accordingly,
                  (for <hi>Maximus</hi> was
                  by birth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
                  possibly
                  might have good friends
                  there, besides
                  his money) and the whole City in a great distemper about
                  the business: the whole cause came
                  at last to be debated
                  in the first general Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                
                where on full hearing
                  of the matter it was
                  thus Decreed,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Maximus</hi> neither
                  was
                  to be taken
                  for a Bishop, , nor any of those he
                  had
                  ordained
                  to be accounted
                  of the Clergy, or remain in any order or degree thereof.
                  Where note, that howsoever <hi>Maximus</hi>
                  came
                  unlawfully
                  unto the bishoprick
                  of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by means
                  whereof all the Acts
                  done
                  by him
                  as a Bishop, were
                  made
                  void and frustrate: yet if as Presbyter,
                  to which degree he had
                  been
                  lawfully
                  ordained
                  by <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> he might have
                  given
                  the <hi>imposition of hands,</hi>
                  the Presbyters
                  by him
                  ordained,
                  would have held
                  good still. But the third case comes
                  nearest
                  to the business, yet as it is
                  thus reported
                  in the Council of <hi>Sevil</hi>
                  before remembred.
                  A Bishop of the Church of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                
                being
                  troubled
                  with sore eyes,
                  and having
                  some presented
                  to him
                  to be ordained
                  Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  did
                  only <hi>lay his hands
                  upon them,</hi>
                  suffering
                  a Presbyter that stood
                  by, to read the words
                  of <hi>Ordination.</hi> This coming
                  to be scanned
                  in the aforesaid
                  Council, upon mature deliberation it
                  is
                  thus determined.
                  First, for the <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
                  which assisted,
                  that for his boldness and presumption, he
                  had
                  been
                  subject to the Councils
                  censure, but that he was
                  before deceased:
                  next for the <hi>Presbyter</hi> and
                  <hi>Deacons,</hi>
                  who were
                  so ordained,
                  that they should actually
                  be deposed
                  from all sacred Orders,
                  Concluding
                  thus, <hi>Tales
                  enim merito judicati sunt removendi, quia prave inventi
                  sunt constituti;</hi> that they
                  were
                  worthily
                  adjudged
                  to lose those Orders,
                  which they had
                  wrongfully
                  received.
                  So little influence had
                  the Presbyters
                  in the essential parts
                  of <hi>Ordination,</hi> as that their bare
                  reading
                  of the words
                  (though required
                  to it by the Bishop) was
                  adjudged
                  enough, not only to make them
                  liable to the Churches
                  Censure,
                  but also for their sakes
                  to make void the Action. Nay so severe and punctual
                  was
                  the Church herein, that whereas certain
                  Bishops
                  of those times,
                  whether consulting
                  their own case, or willing to decline so great a
                  burthen,
                  had
                  suffered
                  their <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi>
                  aswell those which were
                  simply
                  Presbyters,
                  as such as had
                  Episcopal Ordination
                
                
                
                (for two there were)
                  to perform this Office:
                
                it was
                  forbidden
                  absolutely
                  in the one, limited
                  and restrained
                  in the other sort, as by the <hi>Canons</hi>
                  of the two ancient Synods
                  of <hi>Gangra,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> doth at full
                  appear.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is
                  true indeed, that anciently,
                  as long, for ought I know, as there
                  is
                  any Monument,
                  or Record of true Antiquity,
                
                the Presbyters
                  have joyned
                  their hands
                  to, and with the Bishops,
                  in the performance, and discharge of this great
                  Solemnity. And hereof there are many
                  evidences
                  that affirm the same, as well in matter of fact, as in
                  point of Law. Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> one of the
                  ancientest
                  of the Fathers,
                  which now are extant,
                
                affirms,
                  that in the <hi>ordination</hi> of <hi>Aurelius</hi>
                  unto the Office of a <hi>Reader</hi> in the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> he used
                  the hands
                  of his Colleagues.
                  <hi>Hunc igitur  me,  
                  Collegis,
                  qui praesentes aderant, ordinatum sciatis,</hi> as he
                  reports
                  the matter in a Letter to his charge at
                  <hi>Carthage.</hi> Where by <hi>Colleagues</hi>
                  it is
                  most likely that he means
                  his <hi>Presbyters;</hi>
                  first, because that Epistle was
                  written
                  during the time of his retreat, and
                  privacy;
                  what time it is
                  not probable, that any of his <hi>Suffragan
                  Bishops</hi>
                  did
                  resort unto him:
                  and secondly,
                  because those words,
                  <hi>qui praesentes aderant,</hi> are so conform unto the
                  practice of that Church in the times
                  succeeding.
                  For in the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi>
                  held
                  in the year 401.
                
                it was
                  Decreed,
                  that when a <hi>Presbyter</hi> was
                  ordained,
                  the <hi>Bishop</hi> blessing
                  him,
                  and <hi>holding
                  his hand</hi> upon his head, <hi>etiam omnes Presbyteri
                  qui praesentes sunt manus suas juxta manum Episcopi
                  super caput illius teneant;</hi> all the
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  which are present shall likewise lay their
                  hands
                  upon his head, near the hands
                  of the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
                
                And in the same Council it was
                  further ordered,
                  that the <hi>Bishop</hi> should not ordain a Clergy-man,
                  <hi>sine consilio clericorum suorum,</hi> without the
                  counsel of his Clergy: which also doth appear to be
                  <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  practice, in the first words
                  of the Epistle before remembred.
                  But then it is
                  as true withal, that this conjunction of the
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  in the solemnities
                  of this Act, was
                  rather <hi>ad honorem Sacerdotii, quam essentiam
                  operis,</hi> more for the honour of the Priesthood, than
                  for the essence of the work. Nor
                  did
                  the laying
                  on of the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  hands
                  confer upon the party that was
                  ordained
                  any power or order: but only testified
                  their consent unto the business, and approbation of the
                  man, according
                  to the purpose and intent of the last of the two
                  Canons
                  before alledged.
                  And for the first Canon, if you mark it well, it doth
                  not say, that if there be no <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  in place, the <hi>Bishop</hi> should defer the
                  Ordination till they came:
                  but <hi>Presbyteri qui praesentes sunt,</hi> if any
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  were
                  present at the doing
                  of it, they should lay their hands
                  upon his head, near the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  hands.
                  So that however anciently,
                  in the purest
                  times,
                  the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  which were
                  then present, both might and did
                  impose hands
                  with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> upon the man to be
                  ordained;
                  and so concurred
                  in the performance of the outward Ceremony: yet the
                  whole power of Ordination was
                  vested
                  in the person of the <hi>Bishop</hi> only, as to the
                  essence of the work. And this appears
                  yet further, by some passages
                  in the Civil Laws,
                  prescribed
                  for the ordering
                  of Ecclesiastical Ministers;
                  by which, upon neglect or contempt thereof, the
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  were
                  not obnoxious unto punishment that
                  joyned
                  with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> because they
                  had
                  no power to hinder what he meant
                  to do. But the <hi>Bishop</hi> only, <hi>qui
                  ordinat,</hi> or, <hi>qui ordinationem imponit,</hi> he
                  in whom
                  rested
                  the authority, by laying
                  on, or by withholding
                  of his hands,
                  either to frustrate or make good the action: he
                  was
                  accomptable
                  unto the Laws,
                  if he should transgress them:
                  for which consult <hi>Novell.
                  Constitut.</hi> 123.
                
                <hi>Ca.</hi> 16. and <hi>Novell.
                  Constitut.</hi> 6. And so it also
                  stood
                  in the Churches
                  practice; as appeareth
                  plainly
                  by the degradations
                  of <hi>Basilius, Eleusius,</hi>
                  and <hi>Elpidius,</hi> three ancient
                  Bishops,
                  because that (amongst other things)
                  they had
                  advanced
                  some men
                  unto holy Orders,
                  contrary to the Laws,
                  and Ordinances
                  of the Church: of which <hi>Elpidius</hi>
                  was
                  deposed
                  on no other reason, but on that alone. Now
                  had
                  the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  been
                  agents
                  in ordaining
                  as well as the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the
                  imposing
                  of their hands
                  so necessary, that the business could not be
                  performed
                  without them:
                  there had
                  been
                  neither equity, nor reason in it, to let
                  them
                  scape Scot-free, and punish the poor
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  only, for that in which the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  were
                  as much in fault.
              </p>
              <p>
                Against all this,
                
                I meet with no Objection in Antiquity, but what
                  hath
                  casually
                  been
                  encountred
                  in the former passages.
                  This present age doth yield one, and a great one too,
                  which is
                  the case of the <hi>Reformed
                  Churches</hi>
                  beyond the Seas:
                  who finding
                  an
                  aversness
                  of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  at the first, to give them
                  Orders,
                  unless they would desert the work of
                  <hi>Reformation,</hi> which they
                  had
                  in hand, were
                  fain to have recourse to <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  for their Ordinations,
                  in which estate they still continue. That thus it
                  was,
                
                appeareth
                  by the <hi>Augustan Confession,</hi> the
                  Authors
                  and Abettors
                  of the which
                
                
                complain, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> would admit none unto
                  sacred Orders,
                  <hi>Nisi jurent se puram
                  Evangelii Doctrinam nolle docere, except they would be
                  sworn
                  not to Preach the Gospel according
                  to the grounds
                  and Principles
                  of their Reformation. For their
                  parts
                  they professed,</hi>
                  Non id agi ut dominatio excipiatur Episcopis, <hi>that
                  they had
                  no intention to deprive the Bishops
                  of their Authority in the Church; but only that they
                  might have liberty to Preach the Gospel, and be
                  eased
                  of some few Rites
                  and Ceremonies,
                  which could not be observed
                  without grievous sin. This if it could not be
                  obtained,
                  and that a Schism did
                  follow
                  thereupon, it did
                  concern the Bishops
                  to look unto it, how they would make up their
                  account to
                  Almighty God.</hi> So that the Bishops
                  thus refusing
                  to admit them
                  into holy Orders,
                  which was
                  the publique
                  ordinary Door of entrance into the
                  Ministery
                  of the Church; necessity compelled
                  them
                  at the last, to enter in by private
                  ways,
                  and impose
                  hands
                  on one another. In which particular the case of the
                  <hi>Reformed
                  Churches</hi>
                  may not unfitly
                  be resembled
                  unto that of <hi>Scipio,</hi> as it
                  is
                  thus related
                  in the story.
                
                Upon some want of money for the furtherance of the
                  necessary affairs
                  of State, he demanded
                  a supply from the common Treasury. But when the
                  <hi>Quaestor,</hi> pretending
                  that it was
                  against the Laws,
                  refused
                  to open it; himself a private person,
                  seised
                  upon the Keys:
                  <hi>Et patefacto aerario, legem necessitati cedere
                  coegit,</hi> and made
                  the Law give way to the necessities
                  of the Commonwealth. So in like manner, the better to
                  reform
                  Religion, many good men
                  made
                  suit to be supplyed
                  out of the common Treasuries
                  of the Church; to be admitted
                  to the Ministery,
                  according
                  to the common course of <hi>Ordination.</hi> Which when
                  it was
                  denyed
                  them
                  by the Bishops,
                  the Churches
                  <hi>Quaestors</hi>
                  in this case, they rather chose
                  to seise
                  upon the Keys;
                  and receive Ordination from the
                  hands
                  of private persons,
                  than that the Church should be unfurnished.
                  This I conceive to be the Case, at the first
                  beginning.
                  But whether with the change of their condition, the case
                  be altered,
                  or whether they continue in the state they
                  were;
                  I am
                  not able to say any thing. It is
                  a good old saying,
                  and to that I keep me; , that where
                  I am
                  a stranger, I must be no medler.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitherto of the power of <hi>Ordination</hi>
                  committed
                  by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to his two
                  Bishops
                  of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> and in
                  them
                  to all other Bishops
                  whatsoever.
                
                We must next look upon the power of Jurisdiction, and
                  that consists
                  in these particulars:
                  First, in the ordering
                  of Gods
                  Service, and the Administration of his
                  Sacraments.
                  Secondly,
                  in the preaching
                  of his Word, censuring
                  those that broach strange Doctrines;
                  and on the other side encouraging
                  and rewarding
                  such as are laborious in their Calling:
                  and lastly,
                  in correction of the manners
                  of such as walk unworthy of the Gospel of Christ,
                  whether of the Clergy, or the Laity. To these three
                  Heads,
                  we may reduce the several points
                  and branches
                  of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction;</hi> so far forth as
                  the same hath
                  been
                  committed
                  by the Word of God, and by the practice of the Church,
                  unto the managing
                  and care of Bishops.
                  First for the ordering
                  of Gods
                  Service, and all things
                  thereunto pertaining,
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gave
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> this Direction, that <hi>first of
                  all,</hi>
                
                <hi>Supplications,
                  Prayers,
                  Intercessions,
                  and giving
                  of thanks
                  be made
                  for all men:
                  for Kings,
                  and all that be in authority, that
                  men
                  may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all
                  godliness
                  and honesty.</hi> This, as it was
                  a common Duty, and appertaining
                  unto every man in his several place: so the Apostle
                  leaves
                  it unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> to see that
                  men
                  performed
                  this Duty, and were
                  not suffered
                  to neglect it. For that the Prayers
                  here intended,
                  were
                  not the private Prayers
                  of particular persons,
                  but the publique
                  of the Congregation,
                  is
                  agreed
                  on all sides.
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> conceives
                  it so for the Protestant Writers,
                  <hi>Paulus simpliciter jubet quoties orationes publicae
                  habentur,</hi>
                
                that <hi>Paul</hi> doth here appoint what he would have
                  to be comprized
                  in our publique
                  Prayers.
                  <hi>Estius,</hi> for the <hi>Pontificians,</hi>
                  doth resolve so also,
                
                that the place must be understood
                  <hi>de publicis Ecclesiae precibus,</hi>
                  of the publique
                  Prayers,
                  of and in the Congregation. And that the
                  <hi>Western</hi> Churches
                  may not stand alone, <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> do expound the
                  words,
                
                , of the daily Service
                  used
                  in the Church of God, who also call it
                  , the first Christian Duty. Now ask
                  of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
                
                to whom
                  it doth belong to see this Duty
                  carefully
                  discharged
                  as it ought to be; and he will tell you 'tis the
                  <hi>Priest,</hi> or , as he which
                  is
                  the common Father of the Universe, and therefore to take
                  care of all, as doth the Lord, whose Priest, or
                   he is.
                  And ask of <hi>Oecumenius;</hi>
                
                than whom
                  none better understood
                  that Fathers
                  Writings,
                  whom
                  he doth there mean by the <hi>Priest,</hi> or
                  , and he will tell you that it
                  is
                  the <hi>Bishop.</hi> , c.
                  <hi>It doth,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>belong unto the Bishop, as the common Father, to
                  make Prayers
                  for all men,
                
                
                
                faithful and infidels,
                  friends
                  and enemies,
                  persecuters
                  and slanderers.
                  Lyra</hi> speaks
                  home and fully
                  to this purpose also. For this he
                  makes
                  to be <hi>secundus actus ad Episcopum
                  pertinens,</hi>
                  the second Act belonging
                  to the Bishops
                  Office, that Prayers
                  be offered
                  unto God.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ministration of the Sacraments,
                
                being
                  a principal part of Gods
                  publique
                  service, and comprehending
                  Prayers
                  and Supplications,
                  and giving
                  of thanks,
                  must be looked
                  on next. And this we find to be
                  committed
                  principally
                  to the Bishops
                  care, and by their hands
                  to such inferiour
                  Ministers
                  in the Church of God, as they thought fit to trust with
                  so great a charge.
                
                To teach and to Baptize,
                  was
                  given
                  in the charge to the Apostles;
                  and unto none but they did
                  Christ say, <hi>hoc facite,</hi> that they should take
                  the bread and break, and bless it, and so deliver it to
                  the Communicants.
                  So also in the blessing
                  and distributing
                  of the other element. This power they left in general to
                  their Successors,
                  to the Bishops
                  chiefly,
                  and such as were
                  found worthy of so high a trust,
                
                by their permission. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
                  lived
                  nearest
                  to our Saviours
                  time, and had
                  been
                  conversant with the Apostles,
                  doth expresly
                  say it. , c. It
                  is
                  not lawful without the Bishop, either
                  to Baptize,
                  or make Oblations,
                  or celebrate the Eucharist, or finally
                  to keep the Love-feasts,
                  or , which were
                  then in use (for those I take it
                  were
                  the , which the Father
                  speaks
                  of.
                
                ) <hi>Tertullian</hi> for the second Century doth affirm
                  as much. The right, saith
                  he, of giving
                  Baptism, belongs
                  to the chief Priest, that is,
                  the Bishop; next to the Presbyters
                  or Deacons,
                  <hi>non tamen sine authoritate Episcopi,</hi> yet not
                  without the Bishops
                  Licence or Authority.
                
                In the third Century, the Councel
                  held
                  in <hi>Laodicea</hi> is
                  as plain and full, save that indeed it
                  is
                  more general, in which the Presbyter
                  is
                  tyed
                  from doing
                  any thing (<hi>i. e.</hi> such things
                  as appertain to his ministration) .
                  without the knowledge of his Bishop.
                
                Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> finally,
                  no great advancer of the Episcopal authority and
                  jurisdiction, having
                  considered
                  of it better, doth conclude at last, that if the Bishop
                  had
                  not a preheminence
                  in the Church of God, there would be
                  presently
                  almost as many Schisms
                  as Priests.
                  And hence it is,
                  saith
                  he, <hi>Ut sine Episcopi missione
                  neque Presbyter, neque Diaconus jus habeat
                  baptizandi,</hi> that without lawful mission from the
                  Bishop, neither the Presbyter nor
                  Deacons
                  might Baptize.
                  Not that I think there was
                  required
                  in <hi>Hieroms</hi>
                  time, a special Licence from the Bishop, for every
                  ministerial act that men
                  in either of those Orders
                  were
                  to execute,
                  but that they had
                  no more interest therein, than what
                  was
                  specially
                  given
                  them
                  by, and from the Bishop, in their Ordination.

              <p>
                As for the Act of Preaching,
                
                which was
                  at first discharged
                  by the Apostles,
                  Prophets,
                  and Evangelists,
                  according
                  to the gifts
                  that God had
                  given
                  them
                  for the performance of the same; when as the Church
                  began
                  to settle, it was
                  conferred
                  by the Apostles
                  on the several Presbyters
                  by themselves ordained,
                  as doth appear by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
                  exhortation
                  to the Presbyters,
                
                which he called
                  from <hi>Ephesus</hi> unto <hi>Miletum.</hi> To this as
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> had
                  been
                  used
                  before, <hi>doing
                  the work of an
                  Evangelist;</hi> so he was
                  still required
                  to ply it, being
                  called
                  unto the Office of a Bishop. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  conjuring
                  him
                  before God and Christ, that notwithstanding the
                  diversions
                  which might happen to him
                  by reason of his Episcopal place and jurisdiction,
                
                he should Preach the Word, and not to Preach it only in
                  his own particular,
                
                <hi>shewing
                  himself a Workman that needed
                  not to be ashamed,
                  dividing
                  the word of truth aright:</hi> But
                  seeing
                  that others also did
                  the like, according
                  to the trust reposed
                  in them;
                  whether they had
                  been
                  formerly
                  ordained
                  by the Apostles,
                  or might be by himself ordained
                  in times
                  succeeding.
                  Those that discharge this duty both with care and
                  conscience,
                
                guiding
                  and governing
                  that portion of the Church aright,
                  wherewith they are intrusted,
                  <hi>and diligently
                  labouring
                  in the word and doctrine,</hi> by the Apostle are
                  accounted
                  worthy of double honour. Which questionless S.
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had
                  never represented
                  unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> but that it
                  did
                  belong unto him,
                  as a part of his Episcopal power and Office to see that
                  men
                  so painful in their calling,
                  and so discreet in point of government, should be
                  rewarded
                  and encouraged
                  accordingly.
                  By honour in this place, the Apostle doth not only mean
                  respect and reverence, but support and maintenance, as
                  appears
                  plainly
                  by that which is
                  alledged
                  from holy Scripture, <hi>viz. Thou
                  shalt
                  not muzzle the Oxe
                  that treadeth
                  out the Corn: And, the Labourer
                  is
                  worthy of his hi_e.</hi>
                
                <hi>Chrysostom</hi> so expounds
                  the word, , By honour here
                  is
                  meant
                  both reverence and a supply of all
                  things
                  necessary; with whom
                  agree the Commentaries
                  which pass under the name of <hi>Ambrose. Calvin</hi>
                  affirms
                  the like for our modern Writers.
                  <hi>Victum praecipue suppeditari jubet Pastoribus qui
                  docendo sunt occupati; Paul</hi> here
                  commandeth
                  that necessary maintenance
                
                
                be allowed
                  the Pastor, who laboureth
                  in the Word and Doctrin:
                  And hereto <hi>Beza</hi> agreeth
                  also in his <hi>Annotations</hi>
                  on the place. Now we know well that in those
                  times
                  wherein <hi>Paul</hi> wrote
                  to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and a long time after, the
                  dispensation of the Churches
                  Treasury was
                  for the most part in the Bishop, and at his appointment.
                  For, as in the beginnings
                  of the Gospel, the Faithful <hi>sold
                  their Lands</hi>
                  and Goods,
                
                <hi>and laid
                  the money at the Apostles
                  feet,</hi>
                  by them
                  to be distributed
                  as the necessities
                  of the Church required:
                  So in succeeding
                  times,
                  all the Oblations
                  of the faithful were
                  returned
                  in unto the
                  Bishop of the place, and by him
                  disposed
                  of. We need not stand on many Authors
                  in so clear a business. <hi>Zonaras</hi>
                  telling
                  plainly,
                  that at the first, the Bishop had
                  the absolute and sole disposing
                  of the revenues
                  of the Church; ,
                
                no man whoever, being
                  privy to their doings
                  in it. And that they did
                  accordingly
                  dispose
                  thereof, to every man according
                  to his parts
                  and industry, doth appear by <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  where he informeth
                  us, that he having
                  advanced
                  <hi>Celerinus,</hi> a Confessor of great
                  renoun
                  amongst that people, and no less eminent indeed for his
                  parts
                  and piety, unto the office of a Reader, he
                  had
                  allotted
                  unto him,
                
                and to <hi>Aurelius</hi> (one of equal
                  vertue)
                  then a Reader also, <hi>Ut sportulis iisdem cum
                  Presbyteris honorentur,</hi> that they should have
                  an
                  equal share in the distribution with the
                  Priests
                  or Presbyters.
              </p>
              <p>
                But many times
                  so fell out, that those to whom
                  the Ministry of the word was
                  trusted,
                
                Preached
                  other doctrin
                  to the People than that which had
                  been
                  taught
                  by the Apostles,
                
                <hi>Vain talkers
                  and deceivers,
                  which subverted
                  whole houses,
                  teaching
                  things
                  they should not, and that for filthy lucres sake.</hi>
                  What must the Bishop do to them?
                  He must first <hi>charge them
                  not to Preach such doctrins,
                  which rather minister questions
                  than godly edifying:</hi>
                
                And if they will not hearken
                  to, nor obey this charge, ,
                
                he must stop their mouths,
                  let them
                  be silenced
                  in plain English. The silencing
                  of such Ministers
                  as deceive
                  the People, and Preach such things
                  they should not, even for lucres sake, to the
                  subverting
                  of whole Families,
                  is
                  no new matter, as we see in the Church of God. Saint
                  <hi>Paul</hi> here gives
                  it as in charge to <hi>Titus,</hi> and to all
                  Bishops
                  in his person. Certain I am
                  that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> doth so expound it. If thou
                  prevailest
                  not, saith
                  he, by admonitions,
                
                be not afraid, , <hi>silentium iis
                  impone,</hi> the Translator reads
                  it, but silence them
                  that others may the better be preserved
                  by it. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth so translate it also,
                  <hi>quibus oportet silentium indici,</hi> such
                  men
                  must be commanded
                  silence.
                
                And for the charge of <hi>Paul to Timothy,</hi> that he
                  should charge those false Apostles
                  which he speaks
                  of not to Preach strange doctrines;
                  it carries
                  with it an
                  Authority that must be exercised.
                  <hi>For this cause I required
                  thee
                  to abide at</hi> Ephesus, , not that
                  thou shouldst
                  intreat, but command such men
                  to Preach no other doctrines
                  than they had
                  from me. <hi>Theophylact</hi> on those
                  words,
                
                puts
                  the question thus, in the words
                  of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>  it may be
                  asked,
                  saith
                  he, whether that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  were
                  then Bishop when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote
                  this to him.
                  To which he answereth
                  of himself, , that it
                  is
                  most probable; giving
                  this reason of the same, because he
                  is
                  to charge those men
                  not to teach other doctrines.
                
                <hi>Oecumenius</hi> is
                  more positive in the point, and
                  affirms
                  expresly
                  on these words,
                  that <hi>Paul</hi> had
                  made
                  him
                  Bishop there, before that time. And <hi>Lyra,</hi> if he
                  may be heard,
                
                make this general
                  use of the Apostles
                  exhortation, that the first Act here
                  recommended
                  to a Bishop, is
                  <hi>falsae doctrinae extirpatio,</hi> the extirpation of
                  false doctrine.
              </p>
              <p>
                This part of jurisdiction, with those that follow, I
                  shall declare only,
                
                but not exemplifie.
                  For being
                  matters
                  meerly
                  practical, and the proceedings
                  on Record, they will occur hereafter, as occasion
                  is,
                  in this following
                  History. And that which followeth
                  first, is
                  very near of kin indeed unto that before. For many
                  times
                  it happeneth
                  so, that howsoever men
                  be charged
                  not to <hi>teach strange doctrins,</hi>
                  and that their <hi>mouths
                  be stopped,</hi>
                  and they put to silence; yet they will persevere however
                  in their wicked courses,
                  and obstinately
                  continue in the same, until at last their obstinacy
                  ends
                  in heresie.
                  What course is
                  to be taken
                  upon such occasions?
                  The Apostle hath
                  resolved
                  that also. <hi>A man that is
                  an
                  Heretick,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>after the first and second
                  admonition,</hi>
                
                <hi>is
                  to be rejected.</hi>
                  Rejected?
                  but by whom?
                  why by <hi>Titus</hi> surely.
                  The words
                  are spoken
                  unto him
                  in the second person, and such as
                  did
                  possess the same place and office. <hi>Hanc sive
                  admonitionem, sive correptionem, intellige ab Episcopo
                  faciendam,</hi>
                
                c.
                <q>This , which Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  here speaks
                  of, whether that it be meant
                  of gentle admonition, or severe reproof, must be
                  done
                  only by the Bishop, and that not as a private person,
                  but as the governour
                  of the Church, and that both with authority and power,
                  by which he also may denounce him
                  excommunicate, if he amend not on the same.</q>
                So <hi>Estius,</hi> in his Comment on the place; and
                  herewith <hi>Calvin</hi> doth accord,
                
                
                
                <hi>Tito scribens Paulus,</hi>
                
                <hi>non disserit de Officio magistratus, sed quid
                  Episcopo conveniat. Paul,</hi> saith
                  he, writing
                  unto <hi>Titus,</hi> disputes
                  not of the Office of the civil Magistrate, but of the
                  duty of a Bishop. And this in answer unto some, who
                  had
                  collected
                  from these words
                  of the Apostle, that Hereticks
                  were
                  to be encountred
                  with no sharper weapon than that of <hi>Excommunication,
                  nec esse ultra in eos saeviendum,</hi> and that there
                  was
                  no other course to be taken
                  with them.
                  In which these Moderns
                  say no more, as to the exercise
                  and discharge of the Episcopal function in this case,
                
                than what the Ancients
                  said
                  before. I marvail,
                  saith
                  Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> speaking
                  of <hi>Vigilantius, a broacher of strange (or other)
                  Doctrins
                  in the Church of Christ, that the Bishop in whose
                  Diocess
                  he is
                  said
                  to be a Presbyter, hath
                  so long given
                  way to his impiety:</hi> Et non virg Apostolica,
                  virgque ferre confringere vas inutile;
                  <hi>and that he hath
                  not rather broke
                  in pieces
                  with the Apostolick
                  rod, a rod of iron, this so unprofitable a Vessel.</hi>
                  In which as the good Father manifests
                  his own zeal and fervour; so he
                  declareth
                  therewithal, what was
                  the Bishops
                  power and office in the present business.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last part of Episcopal jurisdiction which we have to
                  speak of,
                
                is
                  the correction of ill manners,
                  whether in the Presbyters
                  or in the People; concerning
                  which the Apostle
                  gives
                  both power to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                
                and command to use it. First, for the
                  Presbyters,
                  <hi>Against an
                  Elder receive not an
                  accusation but before two or three
                  Witnesses;</hi>
                  but if they be convicted,
                  <hi>them
                  that sin rebuke before all, that others also may
                  fear.</hi> In the declaring
                  of which power, I take for granted
                  that the Apostle here by Elder, doth mean a Presbyter,
                  according
                  to the Ecclesiastical notion of that word;
                
                though I know that <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and after
                  him
                  <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> do take it
                  only for a man well grown
                  in years.
                  And then the meaning
                  of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will be briefly
                  this, that partly in regard of the
                  Devils
                  malice, apt to calumniate men
                  of that holy function; and partly to
                  avoid the
                  scandal which may thence arise, <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in
                  him
                  all other Bishops
                  should be very cautious in their
                  proceedings
                  against men
                  of that profession. But if they find
                  them
                  guilty, on examination, then not to smother or conceal
                  the matter, but censure and rebuke
                  them
                  openly,
                  that others may take heed of the like
                  offences.
                  The Commentaries
                  under the name of <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                
                do expound it so, <hi>Quoniam non facile credi debet de
                  Presbytero crimen,</hi> c. Because a crime or
                  accusation is
                  not rashly
                  to be credited
                  against a
                  Presbyter; yet if the same prove manifest and
                  undeniable, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  commandeth
                  that in regard of his irregular conversation, he be
                  rebuked
                  and censured
                  publikely,
                  that others may be thereby terrified:
                  And this, saith
                  he, <hi>non solum ordinatis sed  plebi
                  proficit,</hi> will not be only profitable unto
                  men
                  in Orders,
                  but to Lay people also. Herewith
                  agreeth,
                  as to the making
                  of these Elders
                  to be men
                  in Orders,
                  the Comment
                  upon this Epistle,
                
                ascribed
                  to <hi>Hierom:</hi> Presbyters
                  then are subject unto censure; but to whose censure are
                  they subject? Not unto one anothers
                  surely,
                  that would breed confusion; but to the censure of their
                  Bishop, , saith
                  <hi>Epiphanius;</hi>
                
                he speaks
                  to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being
                  a Bishop, not to receive <hi>an
                  accusation against a Presbyter: Theophylact</hi> also
                  saith
                  the same. For having
                  told
                  us, that if a Presbyter upon examination of the business
                  be found delinquent, he must be
                  sharply
                  and severely
                  censured,
                  that others may be terrified
                  thereby; he adds,
                  , that it becomes
                  a Bishop (in such cases)
                  to be stern and awful.
                
                <hi>Lyra</hi> observes
                  the like in his <hi>Gloss</hi> or
                  <hi>Postils,</hi>
                  viz. that the proceedings
                  against inferiour
                  Clergymen,
                  <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> in a judiciary way,
                  is
                  a peculiar of the Bishops.
                  But what need more be said
                  than that of <hi>Beza,</hi>
                
                who noteth
                  on these very words,
                  that <hi>Timothy,</hi> to whom
                  this power or charge was
                  given,
                  was
                  President or , at that time of the
                  <hi>Ephesian</hi> Clergy: Which
                  is
                  a plain acknowledgment, in my opinion, that the
                  correction
                  of the Clergy by the law of God, doth appertain unto the
                  Bishop, the , or President of the
                  Presbytery, call him
                  what you will. For what need we contend for
                  words,
                  when we have the matter? And this
                  appeareth
                  by the several Councils
                  of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Antioch, Sardica, Turin,
                  Africa</hi> and <hi>Sevil;</hi>
                  in all and every of the which, the censure and
                  proceedings
                  against a Presbyter, are left to their own
                  Bishops
                  severally;
                  but a course taken
                  therewithal for their ease and remedy, in case their own
                  Bishops
                  should proceed against them
                  out of heat or passion.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the Lay-people next,
                
                that <hi>Paul</hi> gave
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> a power of correcting
                  them,
                  appears
                  by the instructions
                  which he gives
                  him
                  for the discharge of this authority
                  towards
                  all sorts
                  of People, whether that they be old or young, of what
                  sex soever. Old men,
                  if they offend, must be handled
                  gently,
                  respect being
                  had
                  unto their years.
                  <hi>Rebuke not an
                  Elder,</hi>
                
                <hi>but entreat him
                  as a Father:</hi> i. e. saith
                  <hi>Chryfostom,</hi> take him
                  not up with harshness and severity, but do it with such
                  temperance and meekness as thou
                  wouldest
                
                
                do unto thy Father, if he gave
                  offence. His reason is,
                  because it is
                  an
                  irksome thing unto good persons
                  to be reprehended,
                   especially
                  by one younger
                  than themselves, as then <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  was.
                  The like regard was
                  to be had
                  to old Women
                  also, for the self-same reason. As for the
                  younger
                  men,
                  they were
                  to be rebuked
                  as Brethren, with greater
                  freedom than before, but still with lenity.
                  , the sawce
                  of reprehension must be sweet, though the meat be
                  sowre.
                  Nor was
                  this power committed
                  only unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> but in
                  him
                  to all other Bishops,
                  of all times
                  and places,
                  , so saith
                  <hi>Oecumenius.</hi>
                
                The function of a Bishop was
                  not instituted
                  in the Church of God, <hi>quasi Clero impositus
                  inspector,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi>
                  hath
                  it; that he might oversee the Clergy only, but for the
                  well ordering
                  and governance of all Gods
                  People. <hi>Episcopi Graece, speculatores Latin
                  dicuntur, populi respectu,</hi> He that
                  is
                  called
                  a Bishop in the <hi>Greek,</hi>
                
                saith
                  <hi>Isidore,</hi> is
                  called
                  an
                  Overseer in the <hi>Latine,</hi>
                  and that in reference to the People. And then he
                  gives
                  this reason of it, <hi>quod speculetur  prospiciat
                  populorum infra se positorum mores  vitam,</hi>
                  because he overseeth
                  the lives
                  and conversation of the People which are under
                  him.
                  The like saith
                  <hi>Austin,</hi> as to the reason of the name,
                
                and the intent of their preheminency;
                  the like <hi>Paterius</hi> on the
                  Psalms,
                  and thither I refer the Reader. As for the execution of
                  this power, how, and by whom
                  the same was
                  exercised,
                  being
                  a matter meerly
                  practical, we shall encounter it hereafter, as occasion
                  is,
                  in the success and prosecution of this story. Only take
                  this of <hi>Austin</hi> for a taste or relish, where
                  saying
                  that there is
                  no greater
                  punishment in the Church than that condemnation,
                
                <hi>quam Episcopale
                  judicium facit,</hi> which is
                  pronounced
                  by the Bishop: He adds,
                  that notwithstanding
                  this, <hi>necessitas pastoralis habet separare ab ovibus
                  sanis morbidam,</hi> the Pastor must
                  needs
                  separate the scabby and infected
                  Sheep from the sound and healthy, lest the whole Flock
                  be made
                  obnoxious to so great a danger. What interest or
                  concurrent jurisdiction the Presbyters
                  did
                  either challenge or enjoy in these
                  publick
                  censures,
                  we shall see hereafter. But sure, for ought
                  appears
                  to me, S. <hi>Paul</hi> addresseth
                  his discourse to the Bishop only; who if, in the
                  succeeding
                  Ages
                  he used
                  the Counsel and assistance of his
                  Presbyters,
                  in the affairs
                  and weightier
                  matters
                  of the Church; he did
                  but as a wary and wise man would on the like
                  occasions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would here offer, if I might, some conjectural
                  proofs,
                
                that the description of a Bishop in the first of
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> is
                  of a Bishop truly
                  and properly
                  so called,
                  according
                  as the word was
                  used
                  and appropriated
                  by the Ancient Writers.
                  I know the general current of Interpreters
                  is
                  against me in it, by whom
                  the word <hi>Episcopus</hi> is
                  said
                  to signifie
                  in that place, as well the Presbyter as the Bishop.
                  Which I conceive they do upon this reason
                  chiefly,
                  because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having
                  prescribed
                  the qualities
                  which are required
                  in a Bishop, passeth directly
                  on to the description of a Deacon. But if we look upon
                  it well, I doubt not but we shall perceive some
                  reasons
                  which may incline unto the contrary.
                  For first, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks
                  of a Bishop in the singular number,
                
                but of inferiour
                  Ministers
                  in the plural. One Church, or City, though it
                  had
                  many Presbyters,
                  had
                  one Bishop only: And therefore we may
                  reasonably
                  conceive, that the Apostle speaking
                  of a Bishop in the singular number,
                  speaks
                  of him
                  in his proper and true capacity,
                  as one distinguished
                  from, and above the Presbyters.
                  Secondly,
                  the Apostle seemeth
                  to require in him
                  an
                  Act of Government, as being
                  a man, that is,
                
                <hi>to take a care of the Church of God;</hi> and
                  thereupon gives
                  order for an
                  Inquisition to be had
                  upon him,
                  whether he hath
                  ruled
                  his own house well. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hereupon
                  observes
                  that the Church is
                  likened
                  to an
                  House or Family, wherein there is
                  a Wife and Children,
                  servants
                  and Maid-servants,
                  , all which are subject to the
                  government of the Husband, who is
                  the Father of the Family. So is
                  it in the Church, saith
                  he, the  or
                  Governour
                  whereof is
                  to take care for Widows,
                  Virgins.
                  all Gods
                  Sons
                  and Servants.
                  A care of too transcendent and sublime a nature, to be
                  entrusted
                  unto every common Presbyter, or
                  discharged
                  by him;
                  who as our <hi>Hooker</hi> well
                  observeth,
                  though he be somewhat better able to speak,
                
                is
                  as little to judge, as another man; and if not fit to
                  judge, no fit man to govern. Thirdly,
                
                Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requireth
                  in a Bishop, that he be given
                  to Hospitality, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he receive the
                  Stranger, entertain the Native, and in a word, admit all
                  comers.
                
                <hi>Hierom</hi> doth so expound it,
                  saying,
                  that if a Lay-man entertain but two or three,
                  <hi>hospitalitatis officium implebit,</hi> he
                  hath
                  exceeding
                  well complied
                  with all the rules
                  of hospitality: <hi>Episcopus nisi omnes receperit,
                  inhumanus est;</hi> but that the Bishop
                  is
                  accounted
                  a Churl or Niggard,
                  if his House be not open unto all. Which howsoever it
                  might possibly
                  agree in those ancient times,
                  to the condition of a Bishop, who
                  had
                  the keeping
                  and disposing
                
                
                
                of the Churches
                  treasures:
                  yet I can see no possibility how it could be
                  expected
                  from the Presbyter, that out of his poor pittance from
                  the <hi>Sportula,</hi> he should be able to perform it.
                  For I believe not that the Lord
                  intended
                  to work miracles
                  daily, as in the lengthning
                  and increasing
                  the poor womans oil. Fourthly
                  and lastly,
                  it is
                  required
                  by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                
                that his Bishop must not be , a
                  <hi>Novice</hi> as our English reads
                  it, and exceeding
                  rightly;
                  that is,
                  as <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and out of
                  him
                  <hi>Theophylact</hi> expound the word,
                  , one newly
                  Catechised
                  as it were,
                  lately
                  instructed
                  in the faith. Now who knoweth
                  not, but that in the beginnings
                  of the Church, some of these new
                  plants,
                  these , must of necessity be
                  taken
                  into holy Orders,
                  for the increase and propagation of the Gospel. The
                  Presbyters
                  were
                  many, but the Bishops
                  few. And therefore however there might be found
                  sufficient Standards,
                  upon the which to graft a Bishop; yet I can
                  hardly
                  find a possibility of furnishing
                  the Garden of the Church with a fit number of
                  Presbyters,
                  unless we take them
                  from the Nursery. Hence I collect,
                  that this description of a Bishop in S. <hi>Paul</hi> to
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> is
                  of a Bishop truly
                  and properly
                  so called,
                  and that it doth not also include the Presbyter. If then
                  it be demanded
                  whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath
                  utterly
                  omitted
                  to speak of Presbyters,
                  I answer, no; but that we have them
                  in the next Paragraph, <hi>Diaconos similiter;</hi>
                  which word howsoever in our last translation, it be
                  rendred
                  Deacons:
                  Yet in our old translation, and in that of
                  <hi>Coverdale,</hi> we read it Ministers,
                  according
                  to the general and native meaning
                  of the word:
                
                An
                  Exposition neither new, nor forced.
                  Not new, for <hi>Calvin</hi> doth
                  acknowledge,
                  <hi>alios ad Presbyteros referre
                  Episcopo inferiores,</hi> that some
                  referred
                  those words
                  to Presbyters,
                  subordinate or inferior to the Bishop. Not
                  forced,
                  for if we search the Scripture, we shall there perceive
                  that generally
                  <hi>Diaconus</hi> is
                  rendred
                  Minister; and that not only in the
                  Gospels,
                  before that Deacons
                  had
                  been
                  instituted
                  in the Church of God, but also in S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
                  Epistles,
                  after the planting
                  of the Church, when all the Officers
                  therein had
                  their bounds
                  and limits.
                  Thus the Apostle speaking
                  of himself, and of <hi>Apollos,</hi>
                
                faith that they were
                  , the Ministers
                  by whom
                  that People did
                  believe; himself he calleth,
                  , a Minister
                  of the New Testament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.
                  , a Minister of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  6.4. , a Minister of the Gospel,
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.23. Thus
                  <hi>Tychicus</hi> is
                  called,
                  , a faithful Minister,
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.26. and again, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.7.
                  and so is
                  <hi>Epaphras</hi> entituled,
                  <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.7. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  is
                  called
                  , 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.2.
                  , a good Minister, in this very
                  Epistle; and finally
                  is
                  required
                  in the next to this,
                
                not only to do the work of an
                  Evangelist, but , to fulfil his
                  Ministery.
                  Hence I infer, that since <hi>Diaconus</hi>
                  is
                  a word of so large extent, as to include
                  Apostles,
                  Prophets,
                  and Evangelists,
                  I see no inconvenience that can follow on it, if it
                  include the office of the Presbyter or Elder also: And
                  let the Bishop have the former Character to himself
                  alone, to whom
                  of right it doth belong. But this I only offer to
                  consideration, as my private thoughts;
                  not being
                  so far wedded
                  to mine own opinions,
                  but that on better reasons
                  I may be divorced,
                  when ever they are laid
                  before me.

                WE now proceed unto Saint <hi>John,</hi> and to the
                  Churches
                  of his time, those most especially
                  which he did
                  either plant or water: who living
                  till the end of this present Century, and
                  being
                  the last Surviver of that <hi>Glorious company</hi> of
                  the Apostles,
                  could not but see the Church of Christ in her
                  fullest
                  growth, in her perfection, both for strength and beauty.
                  Of this Apostle we find not any thing in Scripture, from
                  his descent unto <hi>Samaria,</hi> when he
                  accompanied
                  Saint <hi>Peter</hi> thither,
                
                by the appointment
                  of the residue of that <hi>goodly fellowship,</hi> until
                  the writing
                  of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                  The intervening
                  passages
                  of his life and preaching,
                  we must make up out of such fragments
                  of Antiquity, and records
                  of Story, as are come safe unto our
                  hands.
                  Where first I must needs
                  disallow the conceit of those, who carry
                  him
                  I know not how to <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                  making
                  him
                  an
                  inhabitant there, and taking
                  with him
                  to that place, the Mother of our Lord and Saviour: which
                  must needs
                  be, if ever it had
                  been
                  at all, about the 44. year after Christs Nativity, that
                  being
                  the time wherein the Apostles
                  and Disciples
                  were
                  dispersed
                  abroad, upon the persecution raised
                  by <hi>Herod.</hi>
                
                But that it was
                  not then, nor a long time after, will appear by this,
                  that when <hi>Paul</hi> came
                  to preach and reside at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which
                  was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 55. above ten years
                  after, there was
                  so little knowledg
                  of the faith of Christ, that they
                  had
                  not so much as heard
                  there <hi>was
                  any Holy Ghost;</hi> being
                  baptized
                  only, as themselves confessed,
                  <hi>unto John's baptism.</hi>
                
                A thing which could not possibly
                  be supposed,
                  without a great deal of reproach and ignominy to this
                  blessed
                  Apostle, had
                  he been
                  here a resiant, as by some reported.
                  And after this, though we are well
                  assured
                  of his being
                  here, yet then he could not have in
                  houshold
                  with him
                  the blessed
                  Mother of our Lord; who died,
                  in their account that put it off until the
                  latest,
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 48. seven years
                  before the coming
                  of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And
                  therefore I agree rather unto <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as to
                  the main and matter of his Negative, though not as to
                  the reason of it. For where he tells
                  us, that when <hi>JOHN</hi> went
                  down to <hi>Asia,</hi> ,
                
                he took
                  not the <hi>blessed
                  Virgin</hi> with him;
                  I hold it to be absolutely
                  true, past contradiction.
                  But where he buildeth
                  his negation upon an
                   the silence of the Scripture in it;
                  I hold that reason to be insufficient: there
                  being
                  many things
                  of undoubted
                  verity, whereof there is
                  no mention in the Holy Scripture. And I agree too unto
                  <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> where he tells
                  us this,
                
                that Saint <hi>John</hi>'s coming
                  into <hi>Asia</hi> was
                   when he began
                  to be in years;
                  the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> then calling
                  of him
                  thither, as well to propagate the Gospel where it
                  was
                  not preached;
                  as to confirm
                  it where it had
                  been
                  shaken
                  by the force of Heresie.
                  Into what parts
                  the Spirit did
                  before command him,
                  it is
                  hard to say. Some likelyhood
                  there is.
                
                that he did
                  preach the Gospel amongst the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
                  (some of which Nation had
                  been
                  present at <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  at the first giving
                  of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>) his first Epistle
                  being
                  inscribed,
                  <hi>ad Parthos,</hi> as some Antients
                  say.
              </p>
              <p>
                But that he came
                  at last to <hi>Asia,</hi> and there
                  preached
                  the Gospel, is
                  a thing past question.
                
                <hi>Eusebius,</hi> out of <hi>Origen,</hi> doth
                  expresly
                  say it.
                
                And though that piece of <hi>Origen</hi> be
                  lost
                  out of which <hi>Eusebius</hi> took
                  the same; yet we may take it on his word without more
                  authority. Nor did
                  he only preach the Gospel in those
                  parts
                  of <hi>Asia,</hi> strictly
                  and properly
                  so called;
                  but he also planted
                  many Churches,
                  and founded
                  in them
                  many Bishopricks.
                  All the seven Churches,
                  except that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to which he writ his
                  <hi>Revelation,</hi> were
                  partly, if not totally
                  his foundation: and in all them
                  he constituted
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  as we shall manifest and declare anon. And as for
                  <hi>Ephesus,</hi> although he came
                  too late to plant it, yet he came
                  time enough to water it; to settle and confirm the same:
                  being
                  much weakned
                  and endangered
                  by the sorceries
                  and devices
                  of <hi>Apollonius
                  Tyanaeus,</hi> who for some time
                  did
                  therein dwell; as also by the Heresies
                  of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who at that
                  time lived,
                  and therefore rightly
                  doth <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who then
                  lived
                  also, joyn
                  him
                  with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> as a Co-founder
                  of that Church.
                
                But being
                  in the middle of his course, he
                  was
                  sent
                  prisoner unto <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 92. thence
                  confined
                  to <hi>Patmos,</hi> where he continued
                  till the death of the Emperour
                  <hi>Domitian,</hi> which was
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 99. during which time he writ the
                  <hi>Revelation.</hi> And of those
                  Churches
                  I conceive it was
                  that <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh,
                  where pleading
                  in defence of the Catholick
                  Faith, delivered
                  by the Apostles,
                  to the Churches
                  by them
                  severally
                  planted,
                  and by the Bishops
                  of those Churches
                  taught,
                  and in their successions:
                  he thus brings
                  them
                  in, <hi>Habemus  Johannis
                  alumnas Ecclesias,</hi> c. <hi>We have,</hi>
                  saith
                  he,
                
                <hi>the Churches
                  founded
                  by Saint</hi> John. <hi>For howsoever</hi>
                  Marcion
                  <hi>doth reject his Revelation,</hi>
                  Ordo tamen
                  Episcoporum, <hi>yet the succession of their
                  Bishops
                  reckoned
                  up unto their original, will stand for</hi> John <hi>to
                  be their founder.</hi> And probable at their request it
                  was,
                  that
                
                
                
                he writ his Gospel.
                
                For that he writ it at the intreaty of the
                  <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops,
                  <hi>Rogatus
                  ab Asiae Episcopis,</hi> is
                  positively
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Hierom:</hi> though like enough it
                  is,
                  that other Bishops
                  besides
                  those of his own foundation, might contribute their
                  requests,
                  and importunities
                  to so good a purpose, being
                  all equally
                  afflicted
                  with the pest of Heresies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality and condition of these <hi>Asian</hi>
                  Churches,
                
                Saint <hi>John</hi> doth punctually
                  describe in his <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                  written
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 97. when as he
                  had
                  been
                  four or five years
                  confined
                  to <hi>Patmos.</hi> It seemeth
                  those Churches,
                  most of them
                  at the least, on the calamity
                  which befel
                  the Apostle in his deportation,
                  being
                  deprived
                  of the benefit of so Divine and excellent a Spirit, and
                  pressed
                  by the importunity of these active
                  Hereticks,
                  willing to make the best advantage of the present time,
                  began
                  to stagger in the faith, wax cold in their affection to
                  the Gospel, and to give way to such false
                  Teachers
                  as were
                  crept
                  in amongst them,
                  to rectify what was
                  amiss amongst them,
                  and to inform them
                  of their errours
                  did
                  he direct unto them
                  his <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
                
                <hi>To the seven Churches
                  in Asia;</hi> so it doth begin. But when he
                  comes
                  unto particulars,
                  to give them
                  every one their particular charge, from
                  him
                  who <hi>walked
                  in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks;</hi>
                  then he addresseth
                  his discourse to the Angels
                  only,
                
                the Angels
                  of those several Churches.
                  Unto <hi>the Angel of the Church of Ephesus;</hi> and to
                  the <hi>Angel of the Church of Smyrna;</hi> and to the
                  <hi>Angel of the Church of Pergamus;</hi>  sic de
                  caeteris. Now ask the Fathers
                  what those <hi>Angels</hi>
                  were,
                  and they will tell you that they
                  were
                  the Bishops
                  of those several Churches.
                  Saint <hi>Austin</hi> writing
                  on these words,
                  <hi>Unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus,</hi>
                  c. makes
                  this observation,
                
                <hi>Divina voce sub Angeli nomine laudatur praepositus
                  Ecclesiae,</hi> that the Bishop or
                  Governour
                  of the Church, (remember what was
                  said
                  before of the word <hi>Praepositus</hi>)
                  is
                  praised
                  by the voice of Christ,
                
                under the name of an
                  <hi>Angel:</hi> But first he gives
                  a reason of his resolution, shewing
                  that this Expostulation could not be
                  applyed
                  to those <hi>Ministring
                  spirits</hi>
                  in the Heavens,
                  because they still retained
                  their <hi>first Love</hi> to God; and therefore must be
                  understood,
                  <hi>de praepositis Ecclesiae,</hi> of the
                  Rulers

                  given
                  way to false Apostles.
                  The like occurreth
                  in his Comment on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> wherein he
                  maketh
                  the Angels

                give us this short note, <hi>Angelos Episcopos

                  there he meaneth
                  <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  And these ascribed
                  to <hi>Hierom,</hi> writing
                  on those words,
                  <hi>Because of the Angels,</hi>
                
                1 Cor. 11. observes
                  the same, <hi>Angelos ecclesiis
                  presidentes
                  dicit,</hi> that there by <hi>Angels</hi>
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> intends
                  the Presidents
                  or Rulers
                  of the Churches.
                  Finally,
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> saith
                  the same,
                
                who speaking
                  of the seven Churches
                  in <hi>Asia,</hi> to whom
                  Saint <hi>John</hi> addresseth
                  his Discourses,
                  observe, that <hi>John</hi> ascribes
                  to them,
                  , an
                  equal or proportionable number of
                  governing
                  Angels.
                  And on those words,
                
                <hi>the seven stars
                  are the Angels
                  of the seven Churches,</hi>
                  makes
                  this gloss or Comment, , that he
                  calleth
                  these <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  governours
                  of Churches
                  by the name of <hi>stars,</hi>
                  because they borrow all their light from the Sun of
                  Righteousness.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Protestant Writers
                  which affirm the same,
                
                I begin with those which speak most
                  generally
                  and indefinitely:
                
                where first we have <hi>Sebastian Meyer; Ecclesiarum
                  Praefecti,
                   stellae  Angeli, in sacris literis
                  dicuntur;</hi> the Governours
                  of Churches
                  are called,
                  saith
                  he, in holy Scripture, by the name of
                  <hi>Stars,</hi>
                  and <hi>Angels.
                  Bullenger</hi> to the same effect, <hi>Angeli sunt
                  legati Dei, Pastores
                  Ecclesiarum,</hi> the Angels
                  are the Messengers
                  of God, the Pastors
                  of the Churches;
                  in which, lest possibly
                  we might mistake his meaning,
                  in the word <hi>Pastor,</hi> he
                  tells
                  us not long after, that he means
                  the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for speaking
                  of the Angel, or the Pastor of the Church of
                  <hi>Smyrna,</hi> he tells
                  us that he was
                  that <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> as it
                  was
                  indeed, <hi>Ordinatus ab Apostolis, ab ipso inquam
                  Johanne
                  Episcopus,</hi>
                  who was
                  ordained
                  Bishop of that Church by the Apostles,
                  nay by <hi>John</hi> himself.
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> is
                  as general as the other two, but far more express.
                  <hi>Episcopos vocat stellas,</hi>
                  c.
                
                The Bishops
                  are called
                  <hi>Stars,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, because they ought to out-shine others, aswell in
                  purity of Doctrine, as sincerity of Conversation in the
                  Church of God: <hi>eosdem Angelos vocat, quia sunt
                  Legati Dei ad Ecclesiam,</hi> and they are also
                  called
                  <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  because they are the Legats
                  or Embassadours
                  of God to his holy Church. And lest we should mistake
                  our selves,
                  and him,
                  in the word <hi>Episcopus,</hi> he
                  laboureth
                  to find out the Bishop of each several Church, as we
                  shall see hereafter in that inquisition: for those who
                  speak to the particular,
                
                we begin with <hi>Beza,</hi> who on those
                  words,
                  <hi>unto the
                  Angel of the Church of Ephesus,</hi>
                  gives
                  this Annotation. <hi>Angelo,</hi> i. e.
                  ,
                
                
                <hi>quem nimirum oportuit imprimis de his rebus
                  admoneri,</hi> c. To the <hi>Angel,</hi> that
                  is,
                  saith
                  he, to the chief President, whom
                  it behoved
                  to have the notice of the charge there
                  given,
                  and by him
                  to the rest of his <hi>Colleagues,</hi>
                  and the whole Congregation: but
                  fearing
                  lest this Exposition might give some advantage, for the
                  upholding
                  of the Hierarchie,
                  which he so laboured
                  to pull down, he adds,
                  <hi>de proprio,</hi> that notwithstanding this
                  acknowledgment, Episcopal authority,
                  being
                  a thing of mans
                  invention, <hi>hinc statui, nec potest, nec debet,</hi>
                  nor may, nor ought to have any ground from hence.
                  Finally,
                  <hi>Marlorat</hi> himself on those very
                  words,
                
                shews
                  that however there were
                  many things
                  in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which
                  required
                  Reformation, both in the Clergy and the people; <hi>Non
                  tamen populum aggreditur, sed Clerum,</hi> yet the
                  Apostle doth not apply himself unto
                  the people, but the Clergy. Nor doth he fashion his
                  discourse to the Clergy generally,
                  <hi>Sed ad Principem Cleri, Episcopum utique,</hi> but
                  to the chief or principal of the Clergy, which
                  was
                  the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Nay, <hi>Marlorat</hi> goes
                  further yet, and he as he layeth
                  down his interpretation,
                
                so he doth also give a reason of it; and such a one as
                  may well satisfie
                  any man of reason.
                
                His reason is,
                  <hi>Nam Pastor non modo pro propriis,</hi> c.
                  <hi>Because the Pastor is
                  not only to render
                  an
                  account to the supream
                  Judg,
                  for his own sins
                  alone, but for the sins
                  of all his flock, if any of them
                  by his sloth or negligence do chance to perish.</hi> And
                  certainly
                  this reason is
                  of special use and efficacy to the point in hand. For if
                  the Lord do look for an
                  account at
                  the Pastors
                  hand, for every sheep that shall be
                  lost
                  by his sloth or negligence: it must
                  needs
                  follow thereupon, that those of
                  whom
                  so strict a reckoning
                  is
                  expected
                  must not have power only to persuade and counsel, but
                  also to correct and censure, and by their own proper and
                  innate authority, to rectifie
                  such things
                  as are amiss in their several charges.
                  The Son of God is
                  neither so unjust, as that the Pastor should be
                  charged
                  with those enormities,
                  which he hath
                  no authority to amend or rectifie:
                  nor so forgetful as to threaten
                  and rebuke the Pastor, not only for the
                  peoples
                  faults,
                  but the Errata of the Presbyters,
                  in case he were
                  not trusted
                  with a greater
                  power than any of the rest, for that end and purpose.
                  Which being
                  so, and that our Saviour by Saint <hi>John</hi> doth
                  send out his summons
                  neither unto the Church in general, nor to the
                  Presbyters
                  in common, but to the Angel of each Church in the
                  singular number: it is
                  most plain and evident, as I conceive, that in the time
                  of writing
                  the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as long time before it, the
                  Church of Christ had
                  certain Pastors,
                  of more eminent note, when they (as we)
                  intituled
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  which governed
                  as well the Presbyters,
                  as the rest of the Flock; and those the Son of God
                  acknowledgeth
                  for <hi>stars</hi>
                  and <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  And howsoever the inferiour
                  Pastors
                  both are, and may be called
                  <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  in a general sense, as Messengers
                  and Ministers
                  of God Almighty: yet if it be the Angel in the singular
                  number, the Angel in the way of eminence and
                  , it is
                  peculiar only to the Bishop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that each Church of those remembred
                  in that Book, had
                  his proper Angel,
                
                and that they were
                  not governed
                  by a Corporation or Colledg
                  of Presbyters,
                  to whom
                  those several Epistles
                  might be sent,
                  by the name of Angels,
                  the word <hi>Angel</hi> being
                  to be taken
                  collectively,
                  and not individually,
                  as some men
                  suppose, is
                  in the next place to be shewed.
                  And first for proof,
                
                there is
                  a pregnant evidence in a Discourse or Treatise
                  touching
                  the Martyrdom of <hi>Timothy:</hi> the Author of the
                  which relates,
                  <hi>that after Saint</hi> John <hi>the Apostle
                  was
                  revoked
                  from his exile, by the sentence of</hi> Nerva,
                
                <hi>he betook
                  himself to the Metropolis of</hi> Ephesus:
                  , <hi>and being
                  assisted
                  with the presence of the seven Bishops,
                  he took
                  upon himself the government of the</hi> Metropolis
                  <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians,
                  <hi>and there continued
                  preaching
                  the Doctrine
                  of salvation till the time of</hi> Trajan. Which as it
                  is
                  an
                  evident and convincing
                  proof, that the seven Churches
                  had
                  their several Bishops,
                  to each Church one Bishop: so is
                  it no such difficult matter, to find out most of
                  them
                  by name, and what Church each of
                  them
                  did
                  govern. And first for <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                
                some have conceived
                  that <hi>Timothy</hi> was
                  still alive, and Bishop at that time when the
                  <hi>Apocalypse</hi> was
                  written:
                  which hotly
                  is
                  defended
                  by <hi>Alcasar,</hi> against <hi>Ribera, Lyra,</hi> and
                  <hi>Pererius,</hi> who opine the contrary. But
                  surely
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> it could not be, as doth appear in part
                  by that which was
                  alledged
                  out of the Treatise of his Martyrdom, which if it
                  were
                  not written
                  by <hi>Polycrates,</hi> is
                  yet very antient,
                  and authentick:
                  wherein he is
                  conceived
                  to be dead before: but principally
                  by the quality and condition of that
                  blessed
                  Evangelist, so plentifully
                  endued
                  with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> so eminent in piety, and
                  all heavenly graces,
                  that no man can conceive him
                  lyable
                  to the accusation, with which the Angel of that Church
                  is
                  charged.
                  And therefore it must either be that <hi>John,</hi> when
                  (on the death of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                
                
                
                as I conceive) Saint <hi>John</hi>
                  ordained
                  Bishop of this Church, as is
                  reported
                  in the Constitutions,
                
                ascribed
                  to <hi>Clemens:</hi> or else <hi>Onesimus,</hi> another
                  of the Successors
                  of <hi>Timothy</hi> in the See of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who
                  is
                  intituled
                  Bishop of it in the Epistle of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  written
                  to that Church; within twelve years
                  after the writing
                  of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> In which Epistle
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> blessing
                  God for so good a Bishop,
                
                admonisheth
                  the people of their duty, , in
                  submitting
                  themselves unto his judgment,
                  or concurring
                  with it, as their whole Presbytery
                  did:
                  which harmony of the Bishop and his
                  Presbyters,
                  he doth compare  unto the concord of
                  the Strings
                  and Harp. In which he speaks
                  if you observe, as of a Bishop that
                  had
                  been
                  long confirmed,
                  and setled
                  in his place of Government; and
                  knew
                  the temper of his people: one that
                  was
                  vested
                  with a constant, and fixt
                  preheminence
                  above his Presbyters,
                  not with a temporary Presidency, and no more than so.
              </p>
              <p>
                But whatsoever doubt or scruple may be
                  made,
                
                about <hi>Onesimus,</hi> his being
                  Bishop, or Angel at this time, of the Church of
                  <hi>Ephesus;</hi> certain I am,
                  there can be none pretended
                  against <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> as if he
                  were
                  not then the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna:</hi> he
                  being
                  made
                  Bishop of that See 13 years
                  before,
                
                as <hi>Bullinger</hi> computes
                  the time, and holding
                  it a long while after, no less than 74
                  years,
                  as the Annals
                  reckon it, without
                  vicissitude or alteration. Now that this
                  <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was
                  Bishop of this Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                  appears
                  by such a cloud of Witnesses,
                  as he that questioneth
                  it, may with equal reason,
                
                make doubt of yesterday. And first we have
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  one of his Co-temporaries,
                  who taking
                  him
                  <hi>in transitu,</hi> as he was
                  led
                  from <hi>Syria</hi> towards
                  <hi>Rome</hi> to suffer Martyrdom,
                  did
                  after write to him
                  an
                  Epistle, in which he stileth
                  him,
                  in the superscription, , the Bishop
                  of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                
                <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of his Disciples,
                  and who had
                  often heard
                  the good man discourse of his conversation with Saint
                  <hi>John,</hi> reporteth
                  that he was
                  not only taught
                  by the Apostles,
                  and had
                  conversed
                  with many of those who had
                  seen
                  Christ in the flesh, ; but also
                  was
                  by them
                  appointed
                  Bishop of the Church in <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Next
                  comes
                  in the whole Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                
                in their Encyclical Epistle of his death, and
                  Martyrdom,
                  where he is
                  called
                  an
                  <hi>Apostolical and Prophetical Doctor,</hi>
                  , and Bishop of the
                  Catholick
                  Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> After
                  them
                  speaks
                  <hi>Polycrates,</hi>
                
                Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> one of the
                  Successours
                  of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> and so by consequence his
                  Neighbour, who being
                  38 years
                  of age at the time of the death of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi>
                  attesteth
                  to him,
                  saying
                  amongst other things,
                  , that he had
                  been
                  both Bishop and Martyr in <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                
                <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  who lived
                  about the same time with <hi>Polycrates,</hi> though in
                  another Clime or Region,
                  is
                  more particular in the point: not only
                  making
                  him
                  Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as the others do; but
                  <hi> Johanne
                  collocatum refert,</hi> making
                  him
                  to be placed
                  or established
                  there by Saint <hi>John</hi> the Apostle.
                
                From these hands,
                  and no doubt from many others, it
                  came
                  at last to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> Bish. of
                  <hi>Caesarea,</hi> by whom
                  it is
                  affirmed
                  that he was
                  made
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                  , by those which
                  had
                  beheld
                  the Lord, and were
                  his Ministers.
                  Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> finally
                  doth inform us,
                
                that he was
                  a Disciple of Saint <hi>Johns,
                   ab eo</hi> Smyrnae <hi>Episcopus
                  ordinatus,</hi>
                  and by him
                  ordained
                  Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> By which it
                  is
                  most clear and evident
                  that he was
                  the Angel or Bishop of this Church, and thereto
                  constituted
                  by Saint <hi>John,</hi> other of the
                  Apostles
                  and Disciples
                  of our Lord and Saviour, concurring
                  in the Ordination, No titular or nominal Bishop only,
                  but such a one as had
                  a body of Presbyters
                  assistant and subservient to him,
                  as doth most evidently
                  appear out of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  his Epistle unto those of <hi>Smyrna;</hi>
                
                wherein he telleth
                  them,
                  , c. that they ought not to do
                  any thing, no not so much as to administer the
                  Sacrament, without the consent and approbation of their
                  Bishop.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi>
                  is
                  next in order;
                
                but who this was,
                  is
                  not so easie
                  to determine. That there had
                  been
                  a Bishop of this Church before,
                  is
                  proved
                  by <hi>Paraeus</hi> out of <hi>Aretas Caesariensis,</hi>
                
                who makes
                  <hi>Antipas</hi> (whom
                  we find mentioned
                  <hi>Apocal.</hi>
                  2.13.) to be the Pastor of this Church under the Empire
                  of <hi>Domitian,</hi> who being
                  cruelly
                  put to death by the <hi>Pergamenians, successor ejus
                  haud dubi fuit iste, ad quem scribit,</hi> his
                  successour,
                  as there <hi>Paraeus</hi> doth observe, must out of
                  question be the man, to whom
                  as to the Angel of that Church, these
                  things
                  are written.
                  And he informs
                  us this withal, that <hi>similis supplicii metu,</hi>
                  for fear of the like punishment which <hi>Antipas</hi>
                  suffered,
                  though he continued
                  constant in the faith of Christ, he might grow more
                  remiss and negligent in looking
                  to his Pastoral Office. So then the Angel of this
                
                
                Church was
                  <hi>Pergamensis Episcopus,</hi> the Bishop of
                  <hi>Pergamus,</hi> as he plainly
                  calls
                  him;
                
                and possibly
                  may be that <hi>Gaius</hi> whom
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> makes
                  to be ordained
                  Bishop of this Church by the hands
                  of some of the Apostles.
                  Or if not he, yet questionless some one particular
                  person, as <hi>Paraeus</hi> saith:
                  this we may rely upon, though his name we know not. Next
                  is
                  the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira, Antistes
                  Thyatirensis,</hi> that is,
                
                the Bishop of <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
                  saith
                  <hi>Paraeus.</hi> That <hi>Thyatira</hi>
                  had
                  a Bishop, as other the seven Churches
                  had,
                  was
                  affirmed
                  before. And probably
                  the Bishop of it at this time, might be that
                  <hi>Carpus,</hi> who by the name of <hi>Carpus</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Thyatira</hi> did
                  suffer Martyrdom, during the persecution
                  raised
                  by <hi>Antoninus;</hi> whereof consult the
                  Martyrologies,
                
                compared
                  with <hi>Eusebius, lib.</hi> 4. However we may take what
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> gives
                  us, that the Angel of this Church
                  was
                  the Bishop of it, one singular and individual Person, to
                  whom
                  our Saviour doth direct his charge; though there be
                  somewhat in the Text which is
                  alledged
                  to the contrary. For whereas in the two former
                  Epistles,
                  and the beginning
                  of the present, the stile is
                  singular, <hi>I know thy works,</hi>
                
                <hi>and I have somewhat against
                  thee,</hi>
                  here on a suddain,
                  as it were,
                  the stile is
                  altered,
                  and it is
                  <hi>Vobis autem
                  dico,</hi> but I say to you, and unto the rest in
                  <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
                
                Hence some infer, that by the word Angel in that place,
                  is
                  meant
                  not any one singular person, but the whole company of
                  Presbyters;
                  and by the rest, the residue of that People there: the
                  people governed,
                  and the governours
                  in the plural number. But this as I conceive, will avail
                  but little; these alterations
                  or enallages of number being
                  no rare matters
                  in the Scripture, as doth appear by that so memorable
                  place in the first of <hi>Timothy, Salvabitur
                  autem
                  si permanserint,</hi>
                
                where the Apostle doth begin in <hi>she,</hi> and end in
                  <hi>they.</hi> Besides
                  it is
                  observed,
                  that the antienter
                  and better Copies
                  read it without the copulative, ,
                
                <hi>I say to you the rest in</hi> Thyatira; the spirit
                  there addressing
                  his discourse to those godly men
                  that had
                  not known
                  the depths
                  of Satan. And so, besides
                  the antient
                  Copy sent
                  hither by the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
                  cited
                  by my L. B. of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                
                doth <hi>Primasius</hi> read it. <hi>Vobis
                  autem
                  dico, reliqui qui estis Thyatirae. Paraeus</hi> also
                  doth observe, <hi>Veterem sine copula,</hi> that the old
                  Latine
                  hath
                  not the conjunction; and that <hi>Andreas</hi> and
                  <hi>Montanus</hi> do adhere to that. So that for all
                  this observation, the Angel of this Church
                  was
                  a singular person. And this doth further yet appear
                  (since we are fallen
                  upon these Criticisms)
                  by some antient
                  readings
                  of the 20. verse. For whereas now we read in our usual
                  Copies,
                  , the woman <hi>Jesebel,</hi>
                
                the old Greek Copy from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> writ
                  above 1300 years
                  ago, doth read it , thy Wife
                  <hi>Jesebel,</hi> and so doth that also of <hi>Aretas
                  Caesariensis.</hi> And this doth seem to be the
                  ancienter
                  and the truer
                  reading,
                  as being
                  followed
                  by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Primasius</hi> also;
                
                (the first of which lived
                  1400 years
                  agone) in whom
                  we read <hi>uxorem tuam.</hi> And though I grant that
                  the Original standing
                  thus may be translated
                  <hi>thy woman</hi> Jesebel, or <hi>that woman of
                  thine</hi> Jesebel, as I perceive some
                  men
                  would have it; yet then it must be
                  granted
                  therewithal, that the Angel of this Church
                  was
                  one singular individual person, not a body collective.
                  It could not otherwise be thine, but
                  yours.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fifth in order of these Angels,
                  is
                  he of <hi>Sardis, Ecclesiae Antistes,</hi>
                
                the Bishop of that Church, as <hi>Paraeus</hi>
                  noteth;
                  and he observes
                  withal, <hi>veteres quosdam,</hi>
                
                that some ancient writers
                  conceive that <hi>Melito,</hi> of
                  whom
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaketh,
                  <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.
                  was
                  then the Bishop of this Church, and
                  probably
                  it might be so. For howsoever he
                  excepteth
                  against this opinion, because that <hi>Melito</hi>
                  was
                  Bishop of this place under <hi>Antoninus,
                  tamdiu vero Melitonem Sardibus praefuisse non est
                  verisimile,</hi> and therefore that it
                  is
                  not likely that he should so long hold this
                  Bishoprick;
                  yet granting
                  it in <hi>Polycarpus, tamdiu
                  Smyrnensibus praefuisse,</hi> that he
                  was
                  Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> for as long a time: I see no
                  reason why the like may not be granted
                  of the other also: As for his other reason, that
                  <hi>Melito</hi> is
                  commended
                  for his sanctimony, and the Angel here
                  accused
                  for his Hypocrisie;
                  it may well be, that though this Angel
                  were
                  accused
                  of Hypocrisie,
                  at the present time, yet having
                  many good things
                  in him,
                  he might be brought
                  unto a sense thereof, upon this admonition from our Lord
                  and Saviour, and so become a careful and a painful
                  Pastor. So that the ancient Writers,
                  as <hi>Paraeus</hi> saith,
                  reporting
                  that this Angel was
                  that <hi>Melito,</hi> may be believed,
                  for ought I see unto the contrary, in that affirmation,
                  and this I am
                  the rather inclined
                  to think,
                
                because I find a tract of <hi>Melito's</hi>
                  inscribed
                  <hi>Onesimo Fratri,</hi> unto <hi>Onesimus</hi> his
                  Brother, who was
                  the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as
                  before
                  was
                  said,
                  which shews
                  they lived
                  together in one age or time. The Angel of the Church of
                  <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> must be looked
                  on next, whom
                  some conceive to be <hi>Quadratus,</hi>
                  a Scholar or Disciple of the Apostles,
                  of whom
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks,
                  <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 37.
                
                But surely
                  if <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks
                  of him
                  at all, it is
                  as Bishop of <hi>Athens,</hi> not of
                  <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                unless perhaps we may conceive that
                  being
                  first Bishop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> he
                  was
                  translated
                  afterwards
                  to <hi>Athens,</hi> (<hi>Publius</hi> the Bishop
                  being
                  dead, whom
                  he there succeeded)
                  which I somewhat doubt. But whatsoever
                  was
                  his name, or whether he were
                  that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who as <hi>Clemens</hi>
                  saith,
                  was
                  by S. <hi>Paul</hi> made
                  Bishop of this place; I take him
                  for the very man whom
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> speaks
                  of in his Epistle to this People: where
                  speaking
                  of their Bishop, he tells
                  them
                  this, that at the very first sight of
                  him
                  he did
                  plainly
                  see, ,
                
                that neither of his own desire, nor by choice of man
                  was
                  he preferred
                  unto that place, but by the love of Jesus Christ, and
                  God the Father; commending
                  him
                  for modesty, and for a careful walking
                  in Gods
                  Commandments,
                  being
                  like <hi>Zachary,</hi> without reproof; and
                  finally,
                  not only free from passion, but
                  perfectly
                  adorned
                  with all kind of vertue.
                  A commendation very well agreeing
                  with that bestowed
                  upon this Angel by the Holy Ghost; as
                  did
                  the Character of the Angel of the Church of
                  <hi>Smyrna,</hi> agree unto the quality of
                  <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> the then Bishop of it; it
                  being
                  generally
                  observed,
                  as it is
                  most true, that only these two Angels
                  are presented
                  to us without fault or blemish. Last of all, for the
                  Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                
                <hi>Paraeus,</hi> as before conceiveth,
                  that he was
                  the Bishop; <hi>quis vero fuerit, nos latet;</hi> but
                  who this Bishop was,
                  that he cannot tell. Only he notes
                  him
                  for a man, <hi>qui Episcopi titulum perfunctori
                  sustineret,</hi> that only had
                  the name of Bishop, but not one lively spark of Piety,
                  being
                  wholly
                  taken
                  up with luxury and the love of money. But whether he
                  were
                  <hi>Lucius</hi> mentioned
                  by S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16. whom
                  <hi>Dorotheus</hi> makes
                  to be Bishop here; or one <hi>Archippus,</hi>
                  said
                  by <hi>Clemens</hi> to be the Bishop of this Church; or
                  <hi>Sagaris,</hi>
                
                who by <hi>Polycrates</hi> is
                  affirmed
                  to be the Bishop of this place, I
                  am
                  not able to say positively:
                  Though I incline rather unto <hi>Sagaris,</hi> whose
                  Martyrdom being
                  touched
                  upon by <hi>Melito,</hi>
                
                in his books
                  <hi>de Paschate,</hi> is
                  a strong argument that he departed
                  some good time before him,
                  and so most like to be the man. Nor
                  is
                  it any obstacle unto this conjecture,
                
                that Christ did
                  threaten
                  to <hi>spew this Angel out of his mouth,</hi>
                  being
                  he called
                  him
                  to repentance,
                
                and promised
                  him
                  a throne, if he overcame.
              </p>
              <p>
                To bring this business to an
                  end,
                
                these Angels
                  as they had
                  a singularity, in reference
                  unto that personal Authority which each of
                  them
                  enjoyed
                  in his several Church: so had
                  they all and every one of them
                  a singularity in the succession thereunto. For sure it
                  were
                  no difficult matter to a diligent eye, to find out many
                  of their Successors
                  in those several Sees,
                  since that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which
                  was
                  in most apparent danger to lose
                  its
                  Candlestick, retained
                  a continual and constant successions
                  of Bishops
                  there, from the death of <hi>Sagaris</hi> to the
                  <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and a long time after. Where,
                  by the way, I must needs
                  rectifie
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> in this one particular, who
                  shewing
                  that this Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                
                did
                  afterwards
                  recover and get strength again,
                  instanceth
                  in <hi>Anatotius</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> both
                  eminent and learned
                  men,
                  and both Bishops
                  there; whereas indeed they were
                  not Bishops
                  of this <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> (called
                  antiently
                  <hi>Seleucia Tetrapolis</hi>) as he might
                  easily
                  have seen
                  by a more careful looking
                  on those places
                  of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which himself
                  hath
                  cited.
                  Now in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, if we like of that,
                  we find the Successors
                  of those several Angels,
                  subscribing
                  severally
                  to the Acts
                  thereof,
                
                amongst other Prelates
                  of that time; as <hi>viz. Menophanes</hi> of
                  <hi>Ephesus, Eutychius,</hi>
                  B. of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for the province of <hi>Asia;
                  Artemidorus</hi> B. of <hi>Sardis, Soron</hi> or
                  <hi>Serras</hi> B. of <hi>Thyatira, Ethymasius</hi> B.
                  of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for the Province of
                  <hi>Lydia;</hi> and finally
                  <hi>Nunechlus</hi> B. of this <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                
                for the Province of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> for
                  <hi>Theodotus,</hi> who by <hi>Bilson</hi>
                  is
                  affirmed
                  to have subscribed
                  as Bishop of this <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                  was
                  Bishop of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in the Province of
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> amongst the Bishops
                  of which Province his subscription
                  is;
                  which I marvel that most learned
                  and industrious Prelate did
                  not see. And though we find not
                  him
                  of <hi>Pergamus</hi> amongst them
                  there, yet after in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
                  doth his name occur. In fine, by the person that
                  speaketh
                  to the Pastors,
                  and those seven Churches,
                  and the name he gives
                  them,
                  it is
                  plain and evident that their vocation
                  was
                  not only confirmed
                  by the Lord himself, but their Commission
                  expressed.
                  He speaketh
                  that hath
                  best right to appoint what Pastors
                  he would have to guide his Flock, till himself come to
                  judgment:
                  The name he giveth
                  them,
                  sheweth
                  their power and charge to be delivered
                  them
                  from God; and consequently,
                  each of them
                  in his several charge and City, must have Commission to
                  reform the errors
                  and abuses
                  in their several
                  Churches,
                  at whose hands
                  it shall be required,
                  by him
                  that shall sit judge to take account of their
                  doings.
                  And so much for the Angels
                  of the seven Churches
                  in <hi>Asia,</hi> remembred
                  in the book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                But to go forwards
                  to S. <hi>John,</hi>
                
                the Author of it, immediately
                  on his return from <hi>Patmos,</hi> he
                  sets
                  himself unto the reformation of these
                  Churches,
                  calling
                  together the
                
                
                Bishops
                  of the same, as before we shewed;
                  and governing
                  both those and the adjoyning
                  Churches
                  of <hi>Asia minor,</hi> by his Apostolical Authority and
                  preheminence.
                  Which having
                  done
                  on the intreaty and request of some godly
                  men,
                  he went
                  unto the neighbour
                  Nations,
                  ,
                
                in some places
                  instituting
                  or ordaining
                  Bishops,
                  in others rectifying
                  and reforming
                  the whole Churches;
                  and in a word, by the direction of the spirit,
                  founding
                  a Clergy in the same. It seems
                  the journey was
                  not far, the places
                  which he visited
                  being
                  said
                  to be , the
                  neighbouring
                  Nations;
                  and indeed the Apostle was
                  now grown
                  too old to endure much travel, being
                  near an
                  hundred at this time. And therefore I conceive that the
                  Episcopal Sees
                  of <hi>Traellis</hi> and <hi>Magnesia,</hi>
                  were
                  of his foundation:
                
                being
                  Cities
                  not far off, and after reckoned
                  as the <hi>Suffragans</hi>
                  of the Archb. or Metropolitan of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                  Certain I am,
                  that they were
                  both of them
                  Sees
                  of Bishops,
                  as doth appear by the Epistles
                  of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> in which he
                  nameth
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Trallis,</hi>
                
                and <hi>Damas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Magnesia;</hi> and
                  those not titular Bishops
                  only, but such as were
                  to be obeyed,
                  , without gain-saying;
                  and without whose allowance there
                  was
                   layed
                  upon the Presbyters,
                  who were
                  not to do any thing in their ministrations,
                  but by his authority. One other Bishop there
                  is
                  said
                  to be of S. <hi>John</hi>'s ordaining,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the young man which <hi>Clemens</hi>
                  speaks
                  of,
                
                whose aspect being
                  liked
                  by the Apostle, he left him
                  to the care and tutorage of an
                  ancient Bishop of those parts.
                  And when the Young man afterwards
                  for want of careful looking
                  to, became
                  debauched,
                  and made
                  himself the Captain of a crew of
                  Out-laws,
                  the blessed
                  Saint with much ado reclaimed
                  him
                  from that wretched course, and afterwards
                  having
                  new moulded
                  him,
                  and prepared
                  him
                  for it, , made
                  him
                  a Bishop in the Church. But whether that the word will
                  bear that sense, as to the making
                  him
                  a Bishop, or that it only doth imply that S.
                  <hi>John</hi> placed
                  him
                  in some function of the holy Ministery,
                  <hi>Ecclesiae
                  ministeri_
                  praefecit,</hi> as <hi>Christophorson</hi>
                  reads
                  it, I will not contend. Only I cannot but observe, that
                  where the Bishop to whose care he
                  was
                  committed,
                  is
                  in the prosecution of the story,
                  called
                  ; some have
                  collected
                  from the same,
                
                that Bishops
                  in those times
                  were
                  no more than Presbyters.
                  But this will prove, if better looked
                  on, but a plain mistake: the word 
                  in that place, noting
                  the Bishops
                  age, and not his office, as doth appear by that which
                  followeth
                  in the story, where he is
                  called
                  , which certainly
                  doth signifie
                  an
                  ancient man, but not a Presbyter.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <hi>Asian</hi> Churches
                  being
                  thus setled
                  and confirmed
                  in the faith of Christ,
                
                partly by the pains
                  and travel of this blessed
                  man, but principally
                  by the Gospel, and other pieces
                  of Divine holy Scripture, by him
                  written
                  and published
                  about this time,
                
                he went
                  unto the Lord his God in a good old age,
                  being
                  then 98 years
                  old, as <hi>Beda</hi> reckoneth
                  in the beginning
                  of the second century, <hi>Anno</hi> 101.
                  according
                  to the computation of <hi>Baronius:</hi> The Church at
                  his departure he left firmly
                  grounded
                  in all the points
                  of faith and doctrine,
                  taught
                  by Christ our Saviour, as well setled
                  in the outward government, the polity and administration
                  of the same, which had
                  been
                  framed
                  by the Apostles,
                  according
                  to the pattern and example of their Lord and Master. For
                  being
                  that the Church was
                  born of Seed immortal, and they themselves though
                  excellent and divine, yet still mortal
                  men;
                  it did
                  concern the Church in an
                  high degree to be provided
                  of a perpetuity,
                  or if you will, an
                  immortality of Overseers,
                  both for the sowing
                  of this Seed, and for the ordering
                  of the Church, or the field it self. This since they
                  could not do in person, they were
                  to do it by their Successors,
                  who by their Office were
                  to be the ordinary
                  Pastors
                  of the Church, and the Vicars
                  of Christ. Now if you ask the Fathers
                  who they were
                  that were
                  accounted
                  in their times
                  and ages,
                  the Successors
                  of the Apostles;
                  they will with one accord make answer that the
                  Bishops
                  were.
                  To take them
                  as they lived
                  in order, it is
                  affirmed
                  expresly
                  by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                
                one who conversed
                  familiatly with <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>'s
                  Disciple. He speaking
                  of those Bishops
                  which were
                  ordained
                  by the Apostles,
                  and shewing
                  what perfections
                  were
                  in them
                  required,
                  then adds,
                  <hi>Quos  Successores relinquebant sunm ipsorum
                  locum magisterii tradentes,</hi>
                  whom
                  they did
                  leave to be their Successors,
                  delivering
                  unto them
                  their own place of government.
                
                S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> next writing
                  to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  exhorts
                  him
                  to endeavour to preserve that unity, <hi>Per Apostolos
                  nobis Successoribus traditam,</hi> which
                  was
                  commended
                  by the Apostles
                  unto them
                  their Successors.
                  So in another place, speaking
                  of the commission which our Saviour
                  gave
                  to his Apostles,
                  he adds
                  that it was
                  also given
                  to those <hi>Praepositi,</hi>
                
                rulers
                  and governours
                  of the Church, <hi>Qui Apostolis Vicaria
                  ordinatione
                  succedunt,</hi> which by their ordination have
                  been
                  substituted
                  as Successors
                  to them.
                  And lest we should mistake his meaning
                  in the word <hi>Prupositi, Firmilianut,</hi> anothe
                  _i
                  shop of those times,
                
                
                
                
                in an
                  Epistle unto <hi>Cyprian,</hi> useth
                  instead thereof the word <hi>Episcopi,</hi> not
                  varying
                  in the rest from those very words
                  which <hi>Cyprian</hi> had
                  used
                  before.
                
                <hi>Hierom,</hi> although conceived
                  by some to be an
                  adversary of the Bishops,
                  doth affirm as much. Where speaking
                  of <hi>Montanus</hi> and his faction, he
                  shews
                  this difference betwixt them
                  and the Church of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
                  had
                  cast the Bishop downwards,
                  made
                  him
                  to be the third in order, <hi>Apud nos Apostolorum locum
                  Episcopi tenent,</hi> but in the
                  Catholick-Church
                  of Christ, the Bishops
                  held
                  the place or room of the Apostles.
                  The like he saith
                  in his Epistle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi>
                
                where speaking
                  of the parity of Bishops
                  amongst themselves, that the eminency
                  of their Churches
                  did
                  make no difference in their authority; he
                  gives
                  this reason of the same, <hi>Omnes Apostolorum
                  successores sunt,</hi> because they
                  were
                  all Successors
                  to the Apostles.
                  So also in his Comments
                  on the Book of Psalms,
                  writing
                  upon those words,
                
                <hi>Instead of thy Fathers
                  thou shalt
                  have Children,</hi>
                  he tells
                  us that at first, the Apostles
                  were
                  the Fathers
                  of the Church; but they being
                  gon,
                  <hi>Habes pro his Episcopos filios,</hi> the Church
                  had
                  Bishops
                  in their stead: which though they
                  were
                  her Children,
                  as begotten
                  by her, <hi>Sunt tamen  patres tui,</hi> yet they
                  were
                  also Fathers
                  to her, in that she was
                  directed
                  and guided
                  by them.
                
                S. <hi>Austin</hi> on the same words
                  hath
                  the like conceit, the Fathers
                  of the Church, saith
                  he, were
                  the Lords
                  Apostles,
                  <hi>Pro Apostolis filii nati sunt tibi, constituti sunt
                  Episcopi,</hi> instead of those
                  Fathers,
                  the Church hath
                  Children,
                  Bishops
                  that be ordained
                  in her, such whom
                  she calleth
                  Fathers,
                  though her self begat
                  them,
                  <hi> constituit in Sedibus patrum,</hi> and
                  placed
                  them
                  in the seats
                  or thrones
                  of those holy Fathers.
                
                The like the same Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in another
                  place, to the same effect. The root,
                  saith
                  he, of Christian Religion, is
                  by the seats
                  of the Apostles,
                  <hi> Successiones Episcoporum,</hi> and the
                  succession of the Bishops,
                  dispersed
                  and propagated
                  over all the world.
                
                And so S. <hi>Gregory</hi> discoursing
                  of the power of binding
                  and loosing,
                  committed
                  by the Lord unto his Apostles,
                  applies
                  it thus: <hi>Horum nunc in Ecclesi locum Episcopi
                  tenent,</hi> that now the Bishops
                  hold their places
                  in the Church of Christ. Not that the
                  Bishops
                  do succeed them
                  in their personal graces,
                  their mighty power of working
                  Miracles,
                  speaking
                  with tongues,
                  giving
                  the Holy Ghost, and others, such as these, which
                  were
                  meerly
                  temporary; but in their Pastoral charge and
                  government,
                  as the chief Rulers
                  of the Church, the ordinary Pastors
                  of the Flock of Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that the Bishops
                  are the ordinary Pastors
                  of the Church,
                
                and so conceived
                  to be by the ancient Fathers,
                  will be made
                  evident by as good authority as the point
                  before.
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                
                who conversed
                  with most of the Apostles,
                  writing
                  unto the <hi>Antiochians,</hi>
                  requireth
                  them
                  to call to mind <hi>Euodius</hi>
                  (who was
                  his Predecessor in the See of <hi>Antioch</hi>)
                  ,
                
                their most blessed
                  Pastor. <hi>Tertullian</hi> discoursing
                  on those words
                  of Christ, <hi>The hireling seeth
                  the Woolf
                  coming
                  and fleeth;</hi>
                  but that the <hi>good Shepherd layeth
                  down his life for the Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.
                  inferreth
                  thereupon, <hi>Praepositos Ecclesiae
                  in persecutione
                  fugere non oportere,</hi> that the
                  Prelates
                  or Governours
                  of the Church are not to fly in persecution. By which it
                  is
                  most clear, (not to dispute the truth of his assertion)
                  that <hi>Pastor  Praepositus Ecclesiae</hi> do come
                  both to one.
                
                S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his tract <hi>de Aleatore,</hi>
                  is
                  more plain and positive, <hi>Nam ut constaret nos,</hi>
                  i. e. <hi>Episcopos, Pastores
                  esse ovium Spiritualium,</hi> c. that it might
                  evidently
                  appear, saith
                  he, that we the Bishops
                  are the Pastors
                  of the Flock of Christ: He said
                  to <hi>Peter, feed my Sheep.</hi> And in another place,
                  (for fear the former Book may prove none of his)
                  expostulating
                  with <hi>Pupianus,</hi>
                
                who charged
                  him,
                  as it seemeth,
                  for some defect in his administration, he thus
                  drives
                  the point. Behold, saith
                  he, for these six years,
                  <hi>Nec fraternitas babuerit
                  Episcopum,</hi> neither the Brother-hood
                  hath
                  had
                  a Bishop, nor the People a <hi>Praepositus,</hi> or
                  Ruler, nor the Flock a Pastor, nor the Church a
                  Governour,
                  nor Christ a Prelate, nor God a Priest. Where
                  plainly,
                  <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and so all the
                  rest are made
                  to be the same one function. More
                  clearly
                  in another place of the same Epistle, where he
                  defineth
                  a Church to be <hi>Plebs sacerdoti adunata, 
                  Pastori suo grex adhaerens;</hi> that
                  is
                  to say, a People joyned
                  or united
                  rather to their Priest, a Flock
                  adhering
                  to their Pastor.
                  Where by <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> as before, (and in other
                  Authors
                  of the first times)
                  he meaneth
                  no other than a Bishop, as doth appear by that which
                  followeth.
                  <hi>Unde
                  scire debes Episcopum in Ecclesia,</hi> c. From
                  whom
                  thou oughtest
                  to understand, saith
                  he, the Bishop to be in the Church, and the Church to be
                  also in the Bishop; and that whoever
                  is
                  not with the Bishop, is
                  not in the Church. <hi>Optatus</hi>
                  saith
                  the same in brief,
                
                by whom
                  <hi>Pastor sine grege,  Episcopus sine populo,</hi>
                  a Bishop without a Church or People, and a Pastor
                  without a Flock are joyned
                  together as <hi>Synonyma.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  speaking
                  of two sorts
                  of Over-seers
                  in the fold of Christ, some of them
                  being
                  Children,
                
                
                and the others hirelings:
                  then adds,
                  <hi>Praepositi autem
                  qui filii sunt, Pastores
                  sunt,</hi>
                
                the Rulers
                  which are Children
                  (of the Church) they are the Pastors.
                  And in another place not long since
                  cited,
                  speaking
                  of <hi>Episcopale
                  judicium,</hi> the condemnation that
                  attends
                  the Bishops
                  sentence; he presently
                  subjoyns,
                  <hi>Pastoralis tamen necessitas,</hi>
                
                that yet the necessity incumbent on the Pastoral Office,
                  doth many times
                  inflict such sentences
                  for the publick
                  safety of the Flock. I might be infinite in this search,
                  but that I have spoke
                  somewhat to the point already: and
                  am
                  moreover saved
                  all further labour in it, by our
                  learned
                  <hi>Andrews,</hi> affirming
                  positively
                  and expresly,
                
                <hi>Apud veteres Pastorum nomen vix adhiberi, nisi cum
                  de Episcopis loquuntur,</hi> the name of <hi>Pastor</hi>
                  is
                  scarce used
                  among the Ancients,
                  but when they have occasion to speak of
                  Bishops.
                  And <hi>Binius</hi> in his Notes
                  upon the Councils,
                  excepts
                  against a fragment of the Synod of
                  <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
                  said
                  to be held
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 630. as not of that antiquity which
                  is
                  there pretended:
                  and that he doth upon this reason only, <hi>Eo quod
                  titulum _astoris
                  tribuat Parocho,</hi> because the stile of
                  <hi>Pastor</hi> is
                  there given
                  to the common Presbyter,
                
                contrary to the usage of those elder
                  times.
              </p>
              <p>
                And certainly
                  it is
                  no wonder that it should be so,
                
                that he who is
                  <hi>Episcopus  Pastor animarum,</hi> the Bishop and
                  Pastor of our Souls,
                  as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls
                  him,
                
                should confer on them
                  both his Titles:
                  since he hath
                  substituted
                  and appointed
                  them
                  to be his Vicars
                  here on Earth. The Pope may challenge, if he will, this
                  Title to himself alone: but since antiquity
                  hath
                  given
                  it to all Bishops
                  equally,
                  to every one as much as to him
                  of <hi>Rome.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                  hath
                  resolved
                  it generally,
                
                <hi>Episcopus personam habet Christi,</hi> the Bishop,
                  saith
                  he, susteineth the person of Christ, and therefore every
                  Woman ought
                  to behave her self before the Bishop, as before her
                  Judg:
                  giving
                  this reason
                  therewithal, <hi>Quia Vicarius domini est,</hi> because
                  he is
                  the Vicar of the Lord. The Commentaries
                  on Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> ascribed
                  to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> doth affirm the same:
                
                where shewing
                  that such men
                  as persecuted
                  or molested
                  those of the holy Sacerdotal Order,
                  were
                  either Gentiles,
                  or at least sordid and sensless
                  Christians:
                  he gives
                  his reason for the same: <hi>Quia nec intelligunt, nec
                  considerant, sacerdotes Christi Vicarios esse,</hi>
                  because
                  they neither understand nor do consider, that the
                  Bishops,
                  (whom
                  he there meaneth
                  by <hi>Sacerdotes</hi>) are the
                  Vicars
                  of Christ. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> to the same effect,
                
                as before, Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi> The Bishop
                  is
                  to be more pure and pious than another man, for he
                  seemeth
                  to sustein
                  the person of God: <hi>Est enim Vicarius ejus,</hi> for
                  he is
                  his Vicar.
                  The Fathers
                  in the Council of <hi>Compeigne, Anno</hi> 833. thus,
                  <hi>Scire omnes convenit,</hi>
                
                it behoveth
                  all men
                  to understand what is
                  the nature of the Government or Ministry of
                  Bishops,
                  <hi>Quos constat esse Christi Vicarios,</hi> who, as it
                  evidently
                  appears,
                  are the Vicars
                  of Christ. Nay even <hi>Blesensis,</hi>
                
                though he lived
                  and writ when the Papacy was
                  at the height, makes
                  this description of a Bishop. <hi>Ordinatur Christi
                  Vicarius, Ecclesiae Praelatus, c.</hi> He
                  is
                  ordained
                  a Vicar of Christ, a Prelate of the Church, a Father of
                  men,
                  and a Pastor of Souls:
                  So far the Ancients
                  have attested
                  to the present business, and yet there
                  is
                  one Testimony more, which as it
                  is
                  more ancient, so it is
                  as pertinent as any hitherto produced,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> The Declaration of the
                  Fathers
                  in the Council of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 258. or rather
                  the attestation of the Fathers
                  to that which was
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Clarus</hi> of <hi>Muscala,</hi> one of the
                  Bishops
                  there assembled,
                  who being
                  to give his Vote upon the business then in agitation,
                  first thus laid
                  his grounds.
                
                <hi>Manifesta est sententia
                  Domini nostri,</hi> c. The
                  judgment
                  of our Lord and Saviour <hi>JESUS Christ</hi>
                  is
                  plain and evident, bequeathing
                  that authority unto his Apostles,
                  which had
                  been
                  given
                  him
                  by his Father, to which Apostles
                  we are now the successours,
                  <hi>eadem potestate
                  Ecclesiam Domini gubernantes,</hi>
                  governing
                  the Church by that authority, which they
                  had
                  before. In which we see a clear and manifest derivation
                  of this power, this Vicarship, from God the Father unto
                  Christ, from Christ to his Apostles,
                  and by them
                  also to the Bishops,
                  and their successours
                  in the Church for ever. Not that each Bishop in
                  particular hath
                  some particular Apostle whom
                  he doth succeed; I conceive
                  not so: but that the Bishops
                  generally
                  do succeed the Apostles,
                  and are in general
                  Vicars
                  unto Christ our Saviour, as to the general Government of
                  the Church of God. <hi>Apostolis datos esse Episcopos
                  successores, non siagulis Apostolis, sed in solidum
                  universis;</hi>
                
                as the unfortunate Arch-Bish. of <hi>Spalato</hi>
                  hath
                  right well observed,
                  conform unto the Tenet of the Fathers,
                  in this very point. The sum of these three
                  Sections
                  then, in brief is
                  this. Christ by the mission which he
                  had
                  from his heavenly Father, devolves
                  all power on his Apostles,
                  for teaching,
                  governing
                  and directing
                  his <hi>little flock:</hi> and they
                  being
                  sensible of their own mortality, ordain by like
                  authority a line of <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  to succeed them,
                  <hi>ad consummationem seculi,</hi> by
                  whom
                  that care might be
                
                
                
                perpetuated.
                  In whom,
                  as there is
                  <hi>plenitudo potestatis,</hi> a
                  fulness
                  of authority for that end and purpose;
                
                the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as is
                  said
                  by <hi>Ambrose,</hi> being
                  made
                  up of all the Orders
                  in the Church (<hi>nam in Episcopo omnes ordines
                  sunt,</hi> as his words
                  there are:) so he both doth and may assume such and so
                  many associates,
                  assistants,
                  and subservient Ministers
                  <hi>in partem oneris,</hi> for the discharge of this
                  great trusi; as were
                  assumed
                  by the Apostles,
                  or ordained
                  by them
                  rather, for the publick
                  service of the Church.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus have we seen
                  the <hi>Gospel</hi> of our Lord and Saviour,
                
                dispersed
                  in very little time, over all parts
                  and quarters
                  of the World: of so much of it at the least, whereof the
                  Acts
                  and Monuments
                  have been
                  recorded
                  to posterity: and therewith a transmission also of that
                  form of Government, which was
                  begotten
                  by it, and grew
                  up with it. Nor is
                  there any doubt at all, but that into what
                  coasts
                  soever the Lords
                  Apostles
                  preached
                  the one, they also in the same did
                  plant the other. The late discoveries
                  of those parts
                  and Countreys
                  which were
                  unknown unto our Predecessours,
                  make this clear enough: there being
                  no place nor Region how remote soever, where there
                  was
                  extant any thing of the Christian Faith, in which there
                  were
                  not found as apparent
                  footsteps
                  of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> form of Government. A pregnant
                  evidence, that as the Lords
                  Apostles
                  were
                  by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> instructed
                  in that Faith, which they were
                  to preach; so by the same <hi>eternal Spirit</hi> they
                  were
                  directed
                  to that <hi>form of Government,</hi>
                  which they were
                  to plant. They could not else have
                  fallen
                  so unanimously
                  on the self same project: nor had
                  God blessed
                  it with so flourishing
                  and fair increase, a growth so suddain
                  and miraculous; had
                  it not been
                  a graft of his own heavenly planting.
                  Which graft, what root it took
                  in this present Age, in little more than half
                  an
                  hundred years
                  after <hi>Christs Ascension;</hi> we shall best see by
                  looking
                  on this brief <hi>Chronologie,</hi>
                  which I have drawn
                  to that intent.

                  we proceed unto their <hi>Disciples,</hi>
                
                such as conversed

                  and lived
                  nearest
                  to them.
                  And first of all we meet with <hi>Clemens,</hi> once one
                  of <hi>Pauls</hi> Disciples,
                  and by him
                  remembred;
                  afterwards
                  <hi>Deacon</hi> to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>

                  us, and finally
                  successor to them
                  both in the administration

                  several Monuments
                  of Piety which he left behind him,
                  the most renowned
                  is
                  his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi>
                  of which <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives
                  this testimony,
                
                that it was
                   famous and very much
                  admired:
                  adding
                  withal that as well anciently,
                  as in his times,
                  it used
                  to be read publickly
                  in the Congregation. Tht occasion which
                  induced
                  him
                  to write the same, was
                  a sedition, or a faction rather,
                  raised
                  in the Church, which from the first
                  Preaching
                  of the Gospel there, had
                  been
                  too much addicted
                  to <hi>Divisions,</hi>
                  But what this faction was
                  about,
                
                or what occasion
                  was
                  then taken
                  for the production of new broyls,
                  or the reviving
                  of the old; we shall best see by
                  looking
                  on this piece of <hi>Clemens;</hi>
                  recovered
                  from the ruins
                  of Antiquity by the care and industry of <hi>Patr.

                  Library-keeper to his Majesty.
                
                There find we the good man complaining
                  that the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> so ancient and
                
                
                
                well grounded
                  in the faith of Christ, , should for
                  the sake of one or two contentious
                  persons
                  tumultuate against their <hi>Presbyters:</hi>
                  and that the scandal of their functions
                  should come unto the ears
                  of Infidels,
                  to the dishonour of the Lord. Nor
                  did
                  the faction rest in the people only,
                
                though it proceeded
                  to that height as the ejecting
                  of those <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  whom
                  they had
                  distasted:
                  but it had
                  taken
                  too deep sooting
                  amongst the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  themselves, encroaching
                  with too high an
                  hand on the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  Office, or wilfully
                  neglecting
                  his authority.
                
                For whereas in those times,
                  as before was
                  shewn,
                  the blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> regularly
                  and according
                  to the Churches
                  Orders,
                  could not be celebrated
                  but by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by his leave at least, and
                  that it did
                  pertain to him
                  to appoint the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  what turns
                  and courses
                  they should have in that ministration; these
                  men
                  perverting
                  all good order, neither observed
                  the time and place appointed
                  for that sacred Action, nor kept
                  themselves unto those turns
                  and courses,
                  in the performance of the same, which
                  were
                  assigned
                  them
                  by their <hi>Bishop.</hi> Certain I
                  am
                  that the discourse
                  of <hi>Clemens</hi> in the said
                  Epistle doth militate as well against the one, as
                  against the other: blaming
                  as well the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  for their irregular proceeding
                  in their ministration;
                  as censuring
                  the People for their insolency, in the
                  ejecting
                  of their <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  So that we have two factions,
                  at this time in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> one of
                  some inconformable <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  so far averse from being
                  regulated
                  by their <hi>Bishop,</hi> as they ought to be,
                
                that they opposed
                  the very Calling,
                  raising
                  contentions
                  and disputes
                  about the Name and Office of <hi>Episcopacy:</hi>
                  another of the people against the
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  and that pursued
                  with no less acrimony and despite, than the former
                  was.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the repressing
                  of these factions
                  at this present time,
                
                and the preventing
                  of the like in the times
                  to come, the good old man doth thus proceed.
                  Beginning
                  with the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                
                he first presents
                  unto them
                  the obedience that Souldiers
                  yield to their Commanders,
                  shewing
                  them
                  , how orderly, how
                  readily
                  and with what subjection they execute the several
                  Commands
                  imposed
                  upon them
                  by their Leaders:
                  that since all of them
                  are not Generals,
                  Collonels,
                  Captains,
                  or in other Office every one  in his
                  rank or station is
                  to obey the charge imposed
                  upon him,
                  by the King or Emperour,
                  and his Commanders
                  in the Field. Then represents
                  he to them
                  the condition of the natural Body,
                
                in which the Head can do but little without the
                  ministery
                  of the Feet,
                  the Feet
                  as little (out of question)
                  without direction from the Head; that even the least
                  parts
                  of the body are not only profitable, but also necessary,
                  concurring
                  all of them
                  together to the preservation
                  of the whole. Which ground so laid,
                  he thus proceeds
                  in his Discourse: , c.
                
                <hi>These things
                  being
                  thus declared
                  and manifested,
                  looking
                  into the depth of heavenly knowledg,
                  we ought to do those things
                  in their proper order, the People in the
                  tendring
                  of their Oblations,
                  the Presbyters
                  in the celebrating
                  of the Liturgy, according
                  to the times
                  and seasons
                  by the Lord appointed,
                  who would not have these sacred
                  Matters
                  done
                  either rashly
                  or disorderly, but at appointed
                  times
                  and hours,
                  and by such Persons
                  as he hath
                  thereunto designed
                  by his supream
                  Will, that being
                  done
                  devoutly
                  and Religiously
                  they might be the more grateful to
                  him.
                  They therefore who upon the times
                  presixed make their Oblations
                  to the Lord, are blessed,
                  and very welcom
                  unto him
                  from whose commands
                  they do not vary.</hi> , c.
                  <hi>For to the High-Priest was
                  assigned
                  his particular function, the Priest
                  had
                  his peculiar ministery
                  prescribed
                  unto him,
                  and the Levites
                  theirs: the Laymen
                  being
                  left unto Lay-imployments.
                  Therefore let every one of you my brethren, in his Rank
                  and Station, offer to God the blessed</hi>
                  Eucharist, <hi>with a good Conscience;</hi>
                
                <hi>keeping
                  within the bounds
                  of his ministration, appointed
                  to him
                  by the Canon. (For so I take it
                  is
                  his meaning)
                  For not in every place was
                  it permitted
                  to the</hi> Jews
                  <hi>to offer up the daily and perpetual
                  Sacrifices;
                  whether they were
                  Sin-offerings,
                  or Eucharistical Oblations,
                  but at</hi> Hierusalem
                  <hi>alone, nor there in any place
                  indifferently,
                  but only in the Court of the Temple, at the Altar: the
                  Sacrifice being
                  first viewed
                  and approved
                  of, both by the High Priest, and the foresaid
                  Ministers.
                  They that did
                  any thing herein, otherwise than agreeable to his will
                  and pleasure, were
                  to die the Death: you see, my brethren, that as we are
                  endued
                  with a greater
                  knowledg,
                  so are we made
                  obnoxious to the greater
                  danger. The Apostles
                  have Preached
                  the Gospel unto us from Christ;</hi> JESUS <hi>Christ
                  from God: Christ being
                  sent
                  by God, as the Apostles
                  were
                  by Christ; and both proceeding
                  orderly therein, according
                  to his holy Will. For having
                  received
                  his Commands,
                  and being
                  strengthened
                  by the Resurrection
                  of our Lord</hi> JESUS <hi>Christ, and
                  confirmed
                  by the Word of God, they spread themselves abroad, in
                  full assurance of the Holy Ghost,
                  publishing
                  the coming
                  of the Kingdom
                  of God: and having
                  Preached
                  the Word throughout many Regions,
                  and several Cities,
                
                
                they constituted
                  and ordained
                  the first fruits
                  of their labours,
                  such whom
                  in spirit they approved
                  of, to be Bishops
                  and Deacons,
                  unto those that afterwards
                  were
                  to believe.</hi>
                
                <hi>Nor was
                  this any new device, it being
                  written
                  many ages
                  since in the book of God;</hi> Esay
                  60. , i.e. <hi>I will appoint
                  them
                  Bishops
                  in Righteousness, and Deacons
                  in Faith. Afterwards
                  laying
                  down the History of</hi> Aarons
                  <hi>Rod budding,
                  and thereby the miraculous confirmation of his Election,
                  he adds,
                  that the Apostles
                  knowing
                  by our Lord</hi> JESUS <hi>Christ the contention that
                  would arise</hi> , <hi>about the
                  name or function of</hi> Episcopacy,
                
                <hi>(take it which you will) and
                  being
                  for this very cause endued
                  with a perfect foresight
                  of that which afterwards
                  should happen; ordained
                  the aforesaid Ministers,
                  and left to every one their appointed
                  Offices;
                  that whensoever they should die, other
                  approved
                  men
                  should succeed in their several
                  places,
                  and execute their several parts
                  in the Ministration. Those therefore which
                  were
                  either ordained
                  by them,
                  or by those famous and renowned
                  men
                  that followed
                  after them,
                  with the consent and approbation of the Church, and have
                  accordingly
                  served
                  unblameably
                  in the fold of Christ, with all humility and meekness,
                  and kept
                  themselves from baseness and corruption, and have a long
                  time carried
                  a good testimony from all men:
                  those we conceive cannot without much injury be
                  deprived
                  of their place and service: it being
                  no small sin to reject those men,
                  who holily
                  and without reproof have undergone
                  the Office of</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>or
                  done
                  the duty of a</hi> Bishop.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far the Father hath
                  proceeded,
                  as to the Vindication of Episcopacy,
                
                or the Episcopal
                  Function, which you will, from the
                  attempts
                  and practices
                  of such Presbyters,
                  who went
                  about to undermine it, and raise
                  contentions
                  in the Church about it. That which
                  comes
                  after, doth relate to the other Faction, the Faction
                  raised
                  against the Presbyters
                  by some of the unruly people; and that he doth pursue
                  from <hi>pag.</hi> 58. beginning
                  with <hi>Beati sunt Presbyteri,</hi> c.
                  following
                  the same till <hi>pag.</hi> 70. where he
                  persuades
                  the Presbyters
                  that were
                  so distasted,
                  by several Examples
                  both profane and sacred, rather to quit the place for
                  the Churches
                  peace, than by their tarrying
                  there to increase the Rupture. Now that by
                  Bishops,
                  or <hi>Episcopi,</hi> in the words
                  before, he meaneth
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  truly
                  and properly
                  so called;
                  and doth not use the word in so large a sense, as also
                  to include the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  as some men
                  conceive;
                
                doth seem most evident
                  to me, by these reasons
                  following.
                  First, from the Parallel here made
                  between the several degrees
                  and Offices
                  in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and those
                  established
                  in the <hi>Christian:</hi>
                  which had
                  been
                  very imperfect and inconsequent, if there
                  had
                  not been
                  those several and distinct degrees
                  of Bishops,
                  Presbyters,
                  and Deacons
                  in the one, as of the High Priests,
                  Priests,
                  and Levites
                  in the other Church. And that the
                  Bishops
                  in the Christian Church are called
                  many times'
                  , or <hi>High
                  Priests,</hi>
                  in the ancient Writers,
                  is
                  no new Learning
                  unto those that have read the Fathers.
                  And unto this interpretation
                  of the word <hi>Episcopi</hi> in that place of
                  <hi>Clemens,</hi> I am
                  the more inclined
                  to stand, as to the true and proper
                  meaning
                  of the Father; because I find the self-same Parallel
                  produced
                  by <hi>Hierom,</hi> none of the
                  greatest
                  Patrons
                  of Episcopacy. Who tels
                  us first, that many of the Apostostolical
                  Traditions
                  did
                  take their ground or hint from the old Testament, and
                  gives
                  us next this instance of it; or if you will, this
                  resolution
                  in the case: <hi>Quod Aaron,  filii ejus atque
                  Levitae in Templo fuerunt, hoc sibi
                  Episcopi,
                  Presbyteri atque Diaconi vendicant in Ecclesia;</hi>
                  that such as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his
                  Sons,
                
                and the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
                  were
                  in the Temple: the same were
                  Bishops,
                  Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  in the Church of GOD. Where plainly
                  that preheminence
                  which <hi>Aaron</hi> had
                  over and above the Priests
                  and Levites;
                  the same is
                  given
                  by <hi>Hierom</hi> to the Bishops,
                  over their Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  respectively.
                  And this is
                  that which is
                  affirmed
                  in the words
                  of <hi>Clemens,</hi> if we mark it well, the Parallel
                  being
                  brought
                  in both, for the self-same end. And this to me
                  appears
                  yet further to be clear and evident, by the
                  contentions
                  raised
                  by these <hi>Corinthian Presbyters</hi>
                  ,
                
                about the Name or Dignity of Episcopacy; the power and
                  priviledges
                  appertaining
                  to that sacred Calling;
                  and the discourse thereon occasioned,
                  touching
                  the limiting
                  and restraining
                  of these busie
                  Presbyters.
                  unto their proper Rank and Station. For
                  had
                  the heat been
                  only raised
                  upon the deposition of their godly
                  Presbyters,
                  as by some is
                  said:
                  that had
                  not any way concerned
                  either the Name or Dignity of Episcopacy,
                
                (taking
                  Episcopacy in that sense as themselves would have it:)
                  that quarrel not being
                  taken
                  up (as they make the case) against the Dignity or
                  Calling,
                  but the persons
                  only of those Presbyters,
                  whom
                  they had
                  deposed.
              </p>
              <p>
                But I am
                  most of all confirmed
                  herein by the citation of that Text of the Prophet
                  <hi>Esay,</hi>
                  though of a very different reading
                  from those now in use:
                
                
                the application of
                
                
                
                it being
                  so conform to that of other ancient
                  Writers.
                  Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> following
                  the Translation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
                
                doth thus read the Text, <hi>Dabo Principes tuos in
                  pace,  Episcopos tuos in justitia:</hi>
                  observes
                  that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is
                  written
                  thus, <hi>Ponam visitationem
                  tuam pacem,  Praepositos tuos in justitiam.</hi>
                  And thence infers
                  the admirable Majesty of holy Scripture, <hi>quod
                  principes futuros Ecclesiis, Episcopos nominavit,</hi>
                  in that the future Governours
                  (or Princes)
                  of the Church are there, before-hand,
                  called
                  <hi>Bishops;</hi>
                  whose <hi>Visitation</hi> is
                  in peace, and the name or Appellation of their Office,
                  doth denote their justice.
                
                Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> also, although he differ from our
                  Author in the Translation of the Text,
                  following
                  therein the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> as Saint
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> did;
                  yet he agreeth
                  with him
                  in his application. For making
                  a comparison between the Religion
                  of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  and <hi>Christians;</hi>
                  likening
                  the one to Gold and Silver, the other
                  unto Brass and
                  Iron, according
                  to the tenor of the words
                  foregoing:
                  he addeth
                  that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ministers,
                  the <hi>Scribes</hi>
                  and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
                  whom
                  before he spake
                  of, being
                  once removed,
                  , Christ the Redeemer of all people
                  did
                  raise up other Governours
                  and Bishops
                  for them,
                  such as did
                  every way excel in Peace and Righteousness.
                
                And then he makes
                  this use thereof, for our instruction, That since the
                  Princes
                  or Rulers
                  of the Church do excel in Peace, and the
                  Bishops
                  of the same in Righteousness; it ought so far to work
                  upon the people, , as that they
                  should endeavour to lead their lives
                  in Christian Piety and Godliness. Here then we have two
                  of the learnedst
                  of the Ancients
                  writing
                  upon the Text alledged
                  by <hi>Clemens;</hi> and both expounding
                  it of <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  truly
                  and properly
                  so called,
                  according
                  to the nature of that word in the
                  times
                  they lived:
                  and therefore questionless <hi>Clemens</hi> must
                  needs
                  be understood
                  of such Bishops
                  also: And herewith you shall have the reason, why
                  Bishops
                  and Deacons
                  are here joyned
                  together,
                  and that there is
                  no mention made
                  of Presbyters;
                  not that the Presbyters
                  were
                  not ordained
                  by the Apostles,
                  aswell as either of the other; but because the
                  Deacons
                  in this common broyl
                  did
                  constantly
                  adhere unto their Bishop, when as so many of the
                  Presbyters
                  were
                  in opposition:
                
                or else as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells
                  us, because that Bishops
                  at the first had
                  more use of Deacons,
                  than they had
                  of Presbyters:
                  for where the Congregation was
                  but small,
                
                (as that of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi>
                  is
                  said
                  to be, consisting
                  of no more than 17 persons)
                  a Bishop only was
                  sufficient: , but
                  being
                  a Bishop could not be, or at the least not do his
                  Office, without help of Deacons;
                  that Bishops
                  and Deacons
                  are remembred
                  only. And yet perhaps the meaning
                  of the Author may be best conceived,
                  certain I am,
                  the doubt or difficulty would be best
                  removed,
                  did
                  we translate , by the <hi>English
                  Minister,</hi> as in that place I think we may,
                  according
                  to the general meaning
                  of that word in its
                  native sense; the Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  both being
                  but subservient Ministers
                  unto the Bishop, who did
                  allot them
                  out their turns
                  and stations
                  in the officiating
                  of Gods
                  divine Service; the Presbyters
                  not having
                  yet assigned
                  them
                  their particular bounds,
                  wherewith to execute the same, as in the time
                  succeeding
                  it is
                  plain they had.
                  Of which more hereafter.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mean time we must examine whether the Church of
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                
                to which <hi>Clemens</hi>
                  writ, had
                  not been
                  setled
                  by the Apostle in that Form of Government, which
                  had
                  been
                  every where established
                  in the neighbour Cities.
                  And certainly
                  I can see no reason, why <hi>Corinth</hi> should not
                  have a Bishop, aswell as <hi>Athens,</hi> or
                  <hi>Philippi,</hi> or the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
                
                or any other Church of <hi>Greece</hi> or
                  <hi>Macedon.</hi> I see much reason why it should. For
                  if that Bishops
                  were
                  first instituted
                  in <hi>Schismatis remedium,</hi> for remedy of Schism,
                  as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> saith:
                  assuredly
                  the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> being
                  first pestered
                  with that foul Disease, should first of all, in all
                  congruity, be fitted
                  with the remedy so proper and peculiar to it. A Bishop
                  then they were
                  to have by Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi>
                  Rule, and that as soon as any other Church what ever:
                  but who this Bishop was,
                  is
                  not yet so evident. By <hi>Dorotheus</hi> in
                  <hi>Synopsi, Silas,</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> most
                  individual Companion, is
                  said
                  to be the <hi>Bishop</hi> of this Church,
                  <hi>Corinthiorum constitutus est Episcopus,</hi> as his
                  words
                  there are:
                
                wherein <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> concurring
                  with him,
                  doth make the matter the more probable. And though I
                  will not take upon me to justifie
                  the reports
                  of <hi>Dorotheus,</hi>
                  where there is
                  any reason to desert him,
                  as there is
                  too often: yet when the point by
                  him
                  delivered
                  doth neither cross the holy Scripture, nor any of the
                  ancient Writers,
                  as in this he doth not; I know not why his word may not
                  pass for currant.
                  Nay, if we please to search the Scripture, we may find
                  some hint, for the defence
                  of <hi>Dorotheus</hi> in this one particular. For
                  whereas we find often mentioned
                  that <hi>Silus</hi> did
                  accompany Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in many of his
                  peregrinations:
                  the last time that
                
                
                we find him
                  spoke
                  of, is
                  in the 18. of the <hi>Acts;</hi>
                  which time he came
                  unto Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                
                to <hi>Corinth.</hi> After, there
                  is
                  no mention of him
                  in the book of God: And possibly
                  the reason of it may be this, in brief, that he
                  was
                  left there by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to look unto the
                  government of that mighty City. Which when he could not
                  do by the Word and Doctrine, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  reserving
                  for a time the jurisdiction to himself,
                
                as before was
                  said;
                  and that the Factions
                  there did
                  increase and multiply, for want of
                  ordinary
                  power to suppress the same: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might
                  then invest him
                  with authority, making
                  him
                  Bishop of the place, both in Power and Title. This if it
                  may be counted
                  probable, I desire no more. And then as we have found
                  the first Bishop in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> we
                  shall with greater
                  ease and certainty find out a <hi>second,</hi> though
                  his name were
                  <hi>Primus:</hi> for proof of whose
                  being
                  Bishop here,
                
                we have the testimony of <hi>Egisippus,</hi> who
                  took
                  him,
                  in his Journey towards
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and abode long with
                  him;
                  giving
                  him
                  special commendation both for his Orthodoxy and
                  Humanity. After succeeded
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> next to him
                  <hi>Bachyllus;</hi> of both which we shall speak
                  hereafter in convenient place.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the Epistle of this <hi>Clemens</hi> unto those of
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi> which is
                  his undoubtedly,
                
                proceed we next unto the <hi>Canons</hi>
                  commonly
                  called
                  the <hi>Apostles
                  Canons,</hi>
                
                supposed
                  to be collected
                  by him:
                  but so supposed,
                  that still there is
                  a question of it, whether his or not. That they are very
                  ancient is
                  unquestinable, as being
                  mentioned
                  by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and cited
                  in some of the ancientest
                  Councils,
                  whereof the acts
                  and monuments
                  are now remaining
                  on Record. But being
                  it is
                  confessed
                  on all hands,
                
                <hi>quosdam ab haereticis corruptos,</hi>
                  that some of them
                  have been
                  corrupted
                  by the Hereticks
                  of old, the better to advance their cause by so great a
                  Patronage: we must be very wary how we build upon
                  them.
                  And howsoever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be
                  exceeding
                  confident,
                
                that the first 50 are most true and genuine; and
                  probably
                  it may so be: yet I conceive it safe to admit
                  them
                  on those sober cautions,
                  which are commended
                  to us by <hi>Baronius:</hi> who on a full debate of the
                  point in question, doth resolve it thus: <hi>Illi tantum
                  nobis ex Apostolieis
                  fontibus, c. Those Canons
                  only seem to us,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>to be derived
                  from the Apostolical
                  fountains,
                  which have either been
                  admitted
                  and incorporated
                  by the Fathers
                  into the Canons
                  of succeeding
                  Councils,
                  or confirmed
                  by the authority of the Bishops
                  of</hi> Rome, <hi>aut in communem usum Ecclesiasticae
                  disciplinae,</hi> or <hi>otherwise have
                  been
                  continually
                  practiced
                  in the Churches
                  Discipline.</hi> The first and last these three
                  cautions,
                  I conceive to be exceeding
                  sound, and should not stumble at the second,
                  had
                  the Decrees
                  and Ordinances
                  of the ancient Popes
                  come incorrupted
                  to our hands.
                  Which ground thus laid,
                  we will now see what the Apostles
                  Canons
                  have delivered
                  in the present business: and that we shall distribute as
                  it doth relate to Bishops,
                  either in point of their Admission, how and by
                  whom
                  they are to be Ordained;
                  or of their carriage and behaviour
                  being
                  once admitted,
                  how far to disoblige themselves from the
                  employments
                  of the World; or of their Jurisdiction over the
                  inferiour
                  Clergy, whom
                  they are to govern. These are the
                  points
                  which are most clearly
                  offered
                  us to be considered
                  of, in the aforesaid Canons,
                  and these we shall present, and then consider of
                  them
                  accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                And first in way of their Admission to that sacred
                  Function,
                
                it seemeth
                  to be the first care of the Collector, that it be
                  done
                  according
                  to the mind and meaning
                  of the holy Apostles:
                  and therefore it is
                  put in the very front, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Bishop
                  is
                  not to be ordained,
                  but by three Bishops,
                  or by two at the least. , as the
                  <hi>Canon</hi> hath
                  it.
                
                A <hi>Canon</hi> which hath
                  all the Rules
                  and cautions
                  required
                  by <hi>Baronius,</hi> for proof of
                  its
                  antiquity, and Apostolical institution,
                  as being
                  confirmed
                  by many of the Decretals,
                  in case they were
                  of any credit; incorporated
                  first into the Canons
                  of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi>
                
                as afterwards
                  in those of <hi>Nice;</hi> and generally
                  continued
                  in the constant practice and perpetual usage of the
                  Church. Only the difference is,
                  that the old <hi>Canon</hi> doth admit of
                  Ordinations
                  made
                  by two Bishops,
                  if a third may not conveniently
                  be had;
                  whereas the later
                  Councils
                  stand on three precisely:
                  whereof prehaps
                  this was
                  the reason, because in later
                  times
                  there was
                  a greater
                  number of Bishops
                  in the Church of God, than had
                  been
                  before; and so the number of three
                  Bishops
                  to concur together, not so hard to meet with. Now they
                  that search into the first occasion of the present
                  <hi>Canon</hi> fetch it from a Tradition
                  on Record in <hi>Clemens:</hi> viz. that <hi>James</hi>
                  the <hi>Proto-Bishop,</hi>
                
                the first that ever had
                  a fixt
                  Episcopal See, was
                  ordained
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  by <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the
                  sons
                  of <hi>Zebedee. Peter,</hi> saith
                  he, and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
                  being
                  by our Redeemer most esteemed
                  of, contended
                  not amongst themselves after his ascension, for the
                  highest
                  place, , but rather
                  made
                  choice
                
                
                
                of <hi>James</hi> the Just, to be the Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  But this, if looked
                  on well, was
                  no Ordination, for <hi>James</hi>
                  being
                  one of the Apostles
                  needed
                  no such Ceremony; but only an
                  agreement made
                  by that goodly fellowship amongst themselves, that
                  whilst the rest did
                  Preach the Gospel in the world abroad,
                
                Saint <hi>James</hi> should take the charge of the
                  Mother-City. The Ordination of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> unto the Apostleship by the
                  hands
                  of <hi>Lucius, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Manaen,</hi>
                  is
                  indeed more pertinent; but that
                  being
                  an
                  extraordinary case, it can make no precedent. But what
                  need any further pedegree
                  be sought
                  to raise the reputation of this Canon? It
                  is
                  antiquity enough that it stands
                  in front, and leads
                  on all the residue of the Canons,
                  ascribed
                  of old to the Apostles.
                  And yet we must observe withal, that as there
                  is
                  no general rule but hath
                  some exception,
                  so the necessities
                  of the Church have many times
                  dispensed
                  with these ancient Canons;
                
                the Ordination of <hi>Pelagius</hi> the first, once a
                  Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi>
                  Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  being
                  performed
                  by two Bishops
                  only, contrary to the Councils
                  of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Arles;</hi> that of P.
                  <hi>Evagrius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> but
                  by one alone, contrary to the old
                  Apostolick
                  Canon. But then we must observe withal, that these
                  exceptions
                  being
                  in extraordinary cases
                  and occasions,
                  are rather a confirmation of the
                  Canons,
                  than any diminution to them,
                  according
                  to the good old rule, <hi>Exceptio
                  firmat
                  regulam in non exceptis.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bishop being
                  thus admitted
                  to his charge and function by a peculiar
                  Ordination,
                
                we must next see what is
                  prescribed
                  him
                  in these Canons,
                  touching
                  his behaviour,
                  whether Domestick
                  in his Family, or Publick
                  in the Common-wealth. For his Domestick
                  carriage,
                
                it is
                  ordered
                  thus, , that he do not put away his
                  Wife on pain of Excommunication, on any
                  shaddow
                  or pretence of Piety whatever. I know my
                  Masters
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would fain shift this
                  off,
                
                by saying
                  that there is
                  nothing else required
                  by the present Canon, but that they ought to have a care
                  of them,
                  <hi>ipsisque de omnibus quae ad vitam honest
                  degendem requiruntur,
                  provideant,</hi> and to provide
                  them
                  all things
                  necessary for this present life. But
                  surely
                  <hi>Zonaras</hi> gives
                  a fairer
                  and more likely gloss;
                
                by whom
                  it is
                  affirmed,
                  that if a Bishop, or any other person in holy
                  orders,
                  (for the Canon doth extend to all
                  particularly)
                  should under colour of Religion put away his Wife:
                  <hi>He was
                  to be excluded
                  from the Church by this present Canon, till he
                  admitted
                  her again: Admitted
                  her again? to what? Assuredly
                  unto his bed, to cohabitation: Should he do
                  otherwise</hi> (saith
                  he) <hi>it would redound to the reproach of
                  Marriage,</hi> , <hi>as if that
                  conjugal
                  society did
                  beget uncleanness, whereas the Scripture
                  saith,
                  that Marriage is
                  honourable, and the Bed undefiled;
                  adding
                  withal,</hi> , c. <hi>that
                  lawful Wedlock in those times
                  was
                  left free to Bishops,
                  and that it was
                  restrained
                  first by the Synod in</hi> Trullo, <hi>many
                  hundreds
                  after,</hi> An.
                  692. Which being
                  so, the following
                  Canon must admit of some qualification,
                
                by which it is
                  decreed,
                  , that he do not take upon
                  him
                  any worldly cares,
                  or secular affairs,
                  be it which it will. For if he was
                  allowed
                  to have Wife and Children,
                  and consequently
                  was
                  necessitated
                  to maintain a family; it could not be, but he must
                  needs
                  be subject to some worldly cares,
                
                in making
                  fit provision for them:
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> determining
                  that, <hi>If any man provide not for his own,
                  especially
                  for those of his own House, he hath
                  denied
                  the faith, and is
                  worse than an
                  Infidel.</hi> So that these being
                  not the worldly cares
                  which are intended,
                  as they relate to his domestick
                  carriage in his private family; we must next see how far
                  it doth extend to those worldly
                  cares,
                  or rather secular affairs,
                  if any shall so choose to read it, which do concern
                  him
                  in the publick.
              </p>
              <p>
                And here we must first know,
                
                whether that all intermedling
                  in secular affairs,
                  or worldly matters
                  be interdicted
                  by this Canon, meerly
                  <hi>qu tales</hi>
                  for themselves; or as they were
                  an
                  <hi>avocation</hi> from the work of the holy
                  Ministery.
                  Not of themselves, <hi>qu
                  tales,</hi>
                  there's no doubt of that; for then their private and
                  domestick
                  cares
                  must also undergo the same prohibition.
                
                It seems
                  then only as an
                  <hi>avocation,</hi> as they diverted
                  Bishops
                  and the rest in Orders
                  from doing
                  the work of their vocation. <hi>Zonaras</hi> doth
                  conceive
                  it so. , the purpose of the Canon
                  is,
                  that they should attend the holy
                  Ministery,
                  keeping
                  themselves from all disturbances
                  and the tumultuousness of business. But then withal, we
                  must observe that <hi>Zonaras</hi>
                  alloweth
                  them
                  to take care of <hi>Orphans,</hi>
                  and to administer their estate to the best advantage,
                  which is
                  one secular imployment,
                  and no mean one neither. In this the Council of
                  <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> Can. 3. doth agree with
                  <hi>Zonaras,</hi> allowing
                  Clergymen
                  to be Guardians
                  (as we call it) unto those in <hi>Wardship.</hi> Can. 3.
                  Though the providing
                  for the Fatherless be a work of mercy,
                  @ the
                  administration of their estates
                
                
                , as it is
                  there called,
                  is
                  a work of business. And this allowance
                  is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Zonaras</hi> to be consistent with the Canon,
                  which is
                  one thing more; and such a one as will make way for many
                  others. The arbitrating
                  of emergent differences
                  between man and man, for the advancement both of peace
                  and justice, is
                  a worldly work, a secular imployment,
                  past all question. May not the Canon be
                  persuaded
                  to admit of this, and not to have it
                  laid
                  in bar against the Bishop, that he
                  hath
                  left his holy calling,
                  and made
                  himself a Judge amongst his Neighbours?
                  Out of doubt it will: And which
                  is
                  somewhat more, out of doubt it must. Those
                  Canons
                  which are only fathered
                  on the Apostles,
                  will else run cross with those which are theirs indeed.
                  When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> lessoned
                  those of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                
                that rather than they should profane the Gospel with
                  contentious suits,
                  they should refer their differences
                  to their Brethren: Think you it
                  was
                  his purpose either to exclude the Clergy then, or their
                  Bishop after, when they had
                  one? No saith
                  Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                
                (if the work be his) <hi>Melius dicit apud dei ministros
                  causam agere,</hi> no better way than to refer the
                  business to Gods
                  Ministers,
                  who being
                  guided
                  by the fear of God, will determin
                  rightly
                  in the same. Or is
                  the Bishop only to be barred
                  this Office? Not so, saith
                  he. For if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth
                  them
                  to submit themselves unto the judgment
                  of their Brethren, it was
                  upon this reason
                  principally,
                  <hi>quia adhuc Rector in eorum Ecclesia non esset
                  ordinatus,</hi> because, as then, there
                  was
                  no Bishop in that Church. Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  gives
                  it more exactly,
                  makes
                  it a charge imposed
                  upon the Bishop by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> command. For
                  speaking
                  of the pains
                  he took
                  in the determining
                  of such causes
                  as were
                  brought
                  before him,
                
                he tells
                  us that he underwent
                  the same in obedience only to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s
                  injunction, <hi>quibus nos molestiis
                  idem affixit Apostolus,</hi> as his
                  words
                  there are; and that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  imposed
                  it not by his own authority, <hi>sed ejus qui in eo
                  loquebatur,</hi> but by the authority of the Holy Ghost
                  which did
                  dictate to him;
                  adding
                  withal, that howsoever it was
                  irksome and laborious to him,
                  yet he did
                  patiently
                  discharge his duty in it <hi>pro spe aeternae
                  vitae,</hi> only upon the hope of life eternal. And it
                  is
                  worth the observation, that venerable <hi>Beda,</hi>
                  making
                  a Comment upon Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle,
                  collected
                  out of several passages
                  of Saint <hi>Austins</hi> writings;
                  he putteth
                  down this place at large, as the most full and proper
                  exposition
                  of the Apostles
                  words,
                  <hi>Secularia judicia si habueritis,</hi> c. 1
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4. <hi>If then ye have
                  judgments
                  of things
                  pertaining
                  to this life,</hi> c. Here then we have the Bishop
                  interessed
                  in the determining
                  of suits
                  and differences,
                  a secular imployment
                  surely;
                  and yet no violence offered
                  to the sacred Canon. May he not go a little further, and
                  intermeddle,
                  if occasion be, in matters
                  of the Common-wealth? .
                
                I do not blame those Bishops,
                  saith
                  <hi>Synesius,</hi> that are so imployed;
                  such as are fitted
                  with abilities
                  for the undertaking,
                  being
                  by him
                  (a strict and rigorous man) permitted
                  to employ the same. And more than so,
                  , it maketh
                  for Gods
                  praise and glory that it should be so; that
                  men,
                  on whom
                  he hath
                  bestowed
                  abilities
                  to perform both Offices,
                  should do accordingly.
                  But these I put down here as opinions
                  only; the practice of them
                  we shall see in a place more proper. If then it be
                  demanded
                  what those , those worldly
                  cares,
                  and secular imployments
                  are which the Canon speaks
                  off:
                
                <hi>Zonaras</hi> will inform us in another place, that
                  the Canon aimeth
                  at the mingling
                  of the Roman Magistracies
                  , with the Episcopal or Priestly
                  function, which at that time were,
                  questionless, incompatible. And then the
                  meaning
                  of the Canon will in fine be this, that
                  Bishops
                  or inferiour
                  Clergy-men,
                  might not be <hi>Consuls,
                  Praetors, Generals,</hi>
                  or undergoe
                  such publick
                  Offices
                  in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
                  were
                  most sought
                  for and esteemed
                  by the Gentiles
                  there.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for their jurisdiction over the
                  inferiour
                  Clergy,
                
                as far as it is
                  warranted
                  by these Apostolick
                  Canons,
                  it doth co__st
                  especially
                  in these particulars.
                  First, there is
                  granted
                  and annexed
                  unto them
                  the power of Ordination, and to
                  them
                  alone.
                
                The second Canon tells
                  us so, , the
                  Presbyter
                  and Deacon, and all other Clerks
                  must be ordained
                  by one Bishop. And if a Bishop
                  be required,
                  though but one in all, the Presbyters
                  have no authority at all of conferring
                  Orders.
                  But of this before: Being
                  ordained,
                  they were
                  accomptable
                  in the next place to their Bishop, in all
                  things
                  which concerned
                  their Ministration; without whose special leave and
                  liking
                  there were
                  not only many things
                  which they might not do, but there
                  was
                  nothing in a manner to be done,
                  ,
                
                let them
                  do nothing, saith
                  the Canon, without the knowledge of the
                  Bishops;
                  neither Baptize
                  nor celebrate the Eucharist, as <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  hath
                  it, of whom
                  more anon; , not repel any man from
                  the Communion, as it is
                  in <hi>Zonaras.</hi> But here the
                  Canons
                
                
                
                speaking
                  in another place, they will tell you more
                  particularly,
                  that if a Presbyter neglecting
                  or contemning
                  his own Bishop,
                
                shall gather the People into a Conventicle,
                  , and erect another Altar for divine
                  worship, not being
                  able to convict his Bishop of any impiety or injustice;
                  he is
                  to be deposed,
                  , as an
                  ambitious person, seeking
                  a preheminence
                  that belonged
                  not to him.
                  Finally,
                  so obnoxious were
                  the Presbyters
                  to the command and pleasure of their Bishop, that they
                  could not be admitted
                  into any other City,
                
                , without his
                  letters
                  testimonial; and this on pain of Excommunication as well
                  unto the Presbyter
                  that should so depart,
                
                as to the party that received
                  him.
                  If any Presbyter or Deacon, leaving
                  the charge appointed
                  to him,
                  shall go into another Diocess
                  (for so I think , must be read in
                  this place and time) and there abide without the
                  allowance of his Bishop, , he
                  is
                  to be suspended
                  <hi>ab officio,</hi> especially
                  if he return not presently
                  on the Bishops
                  summons.
                  More of this kind there is
                  in those ancient Canons,
                  touching
                  the Presbyters
                  dependance
                  on, and plain subjection to their Bishop. But I have
                  instanced
                  in such only as may be clearly
                  justified
                  by succeeding
                  practice: And so much of the Apostles
                  Canons,
                  ascribed
                  to <hi>Clemens.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                From <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                
                on to <hi>Evaristus,</hi> his next successor in the
                  government of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I know the
                  Antiquaries
                  of that Church have interloped
                  an
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> between
                  these two;
                
                and let them
                  take him
                  for their labour. But when I find in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                  who lived
                  so near the times
                  we speak of, as to converse with those which
                  were
                  then alive, when both these Bishops
                  sate in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and when I find it
                  in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                
                who with such care and diligence
                  collected
                  the successions
                  of the Prelates
                  in the greater
                  Churches,
                  that <hi>Evaristus</hi> did
                  immediately
                  succeed this <hi>Clemens:</hi> I shall
                  desire to be
                  excused
                  if I prefer their testimony in this case, before that of
                  <hi>Anastasius,</hi> or the <hi>Pontifical</hi> or
                  <hi>Platina,</hi> or any whosoever of the
                  later
                  days.
                  Now of this <hi>Evaristus</hi> it
                  is
                  said
                  by <hi>Damasus</hi> in the <hi>Pontifical,</hi>
                
                and from him
                  by <hi>Platina, titulos in urbe Romae Presbyteris
                  divisisse,</hi> that he did
                  first assign the Presbyters
                  in <hi>Rome</hi> their particular
                  charges,
                  which also is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Rob. Barnes,</hi>
                
                one of the great Agents
                  in our Reformation; which words
                  of the Historians
                  being
                  short and dark, we will expound in the
                  expressions
                  of judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> thus, as
                  followeth.
                  <hi>For more convenient discharge of Ecclesiastical
                  duties,
                  as the body of People must needs
                  be severed
                  by divers
                  Precincts,
                  so were
                  the Clergy likewise accordingly
                  distributed.
                  Whereas therefore Religion did
                  first take place in Cities,
                  and in that respect was
                  a cause why the name of Pagans,
                  which properly
                  signifieth
                  Country-people, came
                  to be used
                  in common speech for the same that
                  Infidels
                  and Unbelievers
                  were,
                  it followed
                  thereupon
                  that all such Cities
                  had
                  their Ecclesiastical Colleges
                  consisting
                  of Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  whom
                  first the Apostles
                  or their Delegates
                  the Evangelists
                  did
                  both ordain and govern: Such were
                  the Colleges
                  of</hi> Hierusalem,
                  Antioch, Ephesus, Rome, Corinth, <hi>and the rest, where
                  the Apostles
                  are known
                  to have planted
                  our Faith and Religion. Now because Religion and the
                  Cure of souls
                  was
                  their general charge in common over all that
                  were
                  near about them,
                  neither had
                  any one Presbyter his several Cure apart, till</hi>
                  Evaristus <hi>Bishop in the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>about
                  the year</hi> 112. <hi>began
                  to assign Precincts
                  unto every Church or Title which the
                  Christians
                  held,
                  and to appoint unto each Presbyter a certain compass,
                  whereof himself should take charge alone; the
                  commodiousness of which invention
                  caused
                  all parts
                  of Christendom to follow it:</hi> So he. And he
                  saith
                  well that <hi>Evaristus</hi> first
                  began
                  it; but it was
                  shortly
                  after followed
                  by <hi>Higinus</hi> also, who added
                  more divisions
                  to the former number, if I do understand
                  my Author rightly.
                
                As for the following
                  of this pattern by other Churches,
                  'tis most true indeed that this invention of his
                  was
                  after followed
                  in the Churches
                  of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria:</hi> whereof see
                  <hi>Socrates, Hist. Eccles.
                  l.</hi> 5.3. for that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and for the
                  other <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who reckoneth
                  <hi>nomin__im</hi>
                  those several Churches,
                  which were
                  before the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> in that famous
                  City. And doubtless in all other
                  Cities
                  as the number of Christians
                  did
                  increase, so were
                  the like divisions
                  made,
                  and several Presbyters
                  appointed
                  for those divisions,
                  though we have no such pregnant
                  evidence
                  thereof, as for those before. But then we must observe
                  withal, that such divisions
                  were
                  not in the Country till a long time after, as we shall
                  let you see in due place and time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for those Colleges
                  of Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                
                whereof <hi>Hooker</hi> speaketh,
                  founded
                  by the Apostles
                  and Evangelists
                  in all the Cities
                  wherein they planted
                  the Gospel of Christ, and by them
                  conjoyned
                  into one Church under and with the Bishop: It
                  was
                  a very excellent and useful institution,
                
                as the times
                  then were.
                  For first it did
                  exceedingly
                  promote the conversion of the world to Christ our
                  Saviour; it being
                  a work
                
                
                too great for one or two to undertake in a populous
                  City, and would require more time to effect the same,
                  than such a weighty business could afford. The Harvest
                  being
                  great, it was
                  most expedient that the Labourers
                  should also be many; that so the truth of Christ might
                  disperse it self not only throughout their
                  Cities,
                  but even unto those Country Towns
                  and Villages
                  which bordered
                  near them.
                  A second use was
                  to continue those whom
                  they had
                  converted,
                  in the Faith of Christ, instructing
                  and incouraging
                  the Faithful from house to house, and from man to man,
                  to stand fast to the Doctrine which they
                  had
                  received,
                  and not to shrink under the bloody
                  storms
                  of persecution,
                  which were
                  then so frequent. A work that of necessity
                  required
                  many hands;
                  the more, because the faithful in those dangerous
                  times
                  had
                  not their publick
                  places
                  of Assembly;
                  or if they had,
                  durst
                  not frequent the same as in times
                  of peace: and so the labour must be great, and the
                  persons
                  many, in Preaching,
                  teaching,
                  and exhorting
                  in their private houses,
                  or in those secret places
                  where they met
                  by stealth for the receiving
                  of the Sacrament. A third use was,
                  that from these Presbyteries,
                  or Colleges
                  of Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  as from a sacred spring or fountain, there might be a
                  continual supply of fit and able
                  men,
                  by whom
                  as well the Cities
                  themselves might be continually
                  furnished
                  for their own occasions;
                  and also that from thence, the smaller
                  Towns
                  and Villages
                  within the circuit of those Cities,
                  which for the slenderness
                  of their estate, and paucity of
                  believers
                  could not maintain a Presbyter at their proper charge,
                  might be provided
                  of industrious teachers
                  for their spiritual necessities.
                  For in these times
                  whereof we speak, and a long time after, the
                  Villages
                  and Country Towns,
                  as they were
                  converted
                  to the Faith, and did
                  desire a Minister of the Word and
                  Sacraments
                  to reside amongst them;
                  so they repaired
                  unto the Bishop of the City, within whose
                   or bounds
                  they were,
                  of him
                  desiring
                  a fit man for that business;
                  which course continued
                  in the Church for a long time after, until
                  Churches
                  were
                  endowed
                  with Tithes,
                  and Glebe, and Mansion houses,
                  which drew
                  the Patronage
                  or Presentation, as we call it, into
                  hands
                  of such their Founders
                  and liberal Benefactors
                  to the same. The last, but not the least,
                  was
                  the advising
                  and assisting
                  of the Bishop of the Church or City in all
                  doubts
                  and dangers;
                  as well in making
                  Rules
                  and Ordinances
                  for the better government of the place; as for the
                  censuring
                  and correcting
                  of such faulty persons,
                  whether of the Clergy or Laity, as
                  were
                  thought fit to be convented,
                  for an
                  example to the rest.
                
                In which regard <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  calleth
                  the Presbytery,
                  or College of Presbyters
                  (and not the Priesthood, <hi>Sacerdotium,</hi> as it
                  is
                  rendred
                  by <hi>Vedelius</hi>) ,
                  an
                  holy Corporation, Counsellors
                  and Assessors
                  to the Bishop. A perfect Image of the which, we have
                  remaining
                  in our Deans
                  and Chapters
                  of Cathedral Churches,
                  though not so frequently
                  consulted
                  with in the Churches
                  business, as I could heartily
                  desire they were,
                  and as our Canons
                  now in force in some sort require.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mention which I made
                  so lately
                  of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> leads
                  me on to him,
                
                who yielded
                  up his pious soul by Martyrdom to the
                  hands
                  of God in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst
                  <hi>Euaristus</hi>
                  was
                  there Bishop: And in him
                  I shall only touch upon those Epistles
                  which I find mentioned
                  in <hi>Eusebius;</hi> and which <hi>Vedelius</hi> doth
                  confess and defend to boot,
                
                to be truly
                  his: But by the way I must first tell you that
                  <hi>Vedelius</hi> in this business
                  deals
                  for all the world like the naughty Cow that
                  gives
                  a good meals
                  milk and kicketh
                  it down with her heel. For having
                  shewed
                  some pains
                  and learning
                  in his Apology for <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  in vindicating
                  these Epistles
                  from all those who except against
                  them:
                  Yet in the body of the Text, when ever he doth meet with
                  any thing which runneth
                  cross unto his fancies;
                  that he excepts
                  against himself, as supposititious and adulterate, or
                  else destroyeth
                  a good Text with a faulty Comment. But let us take the
                  Author as he gives
                  him
                  to us. .
                
                Be subject to the Bishop (saith
                  the good Father) as unto the Lord, and to the
                  Presbyters
                  as to Christs Apostles.
                  <hi>Vedelius</hi> hereupon observes
                  that the Presbyters
                  are the proper successors
                  of the Apostles,
                
                contrary unto that of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who
                  makes
                  them
                  (as he saith)
                  to succeed the seventy. In which <hi>Vedelius</hi> doth
                  the Bishops
                  a far greater
                  courtesie
                  than I believe he did
                  intend them;
                  making
                  the disproportion more considerable between the Bishop
                  and his Presbyters
                  than any Champion of the Prelacy
                  had
                  done
                  before him.
                  For if <hi>Vedelius</hi> may infer from our
                  Authors
                  words
                  that the Presbyters
                  are successors
                  unto the Apostles,
                  we may as well infer from the self same
                  grounds,
                  that Bishops
                  are the successors
                  of Christ our Saviour. The like obedience to the Bishop
                  he presseth
                  in another place of the same Epistle.
                  . Reverence your Bishop as you would
                  do Christ, as the Apostles
                  have commanded.
                
                And then he gives
                  this
                
                
                
                reason of it, ; for what else
                  is
                  the Bishop, but one superiour
                  unto all in
                  place and Power? what else the Presbytery, but
                  an
                  holy Company, the Counsellers
                  and Assessors
                  of the Bishop? In which we have as great a difference
                  betwixt a Bishop and his Presbyters;
                  as is
                  between a Prince and his Privy Council. In that to the
                  <hi>Magnesians</hi> thus;
                
                , c. It
                  becomes
                  you to obey your Bishop, not being
                  refractory against him
                  in any thing: for a most terrible thing it
                  is
                  to contradict him
                  and oppose him,
                  in that the contumely or reproach doth redound to God.
                  In his third Epistle,
                
                that to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi>
                  he writeth
                  thus.  the Priests
                  are good, and so are the Deacons,
                  as being
                  Ministers
                  of the Word; but better, or more excellent
                  is
                  the Chief Priest, as being
                  only trusted
                  with the Holy of Holies,
                  and the secrets
                  of God.
                
                The like occurs
                  in that to those of <hi>Smyrna;</hi>
                  , c. Honour God as the Author
                  and Lord of all things,
                  and your Bishop as the <hi>chief Priest,</hi>
                  bearing
                  the Image of God; that is
                  to say, of God as he is
                  chief, and of Christ as <hi>Priest.</hi> And though
                  <hi>Vedelius</hi> brands
                  this last as supposititious,
                
                and in the former by <hi>chief Priest</hi> will have our
                  Saviour meant,
                  and not the Bishop: yet he that
                  looks
                  upon the place without prejudice,
                
                will easily
                  discern the contrary; the comparison which there
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  maketh,
                  being
                  between the Ministers
                  of the Church with one another, and not between the
                  Ministers
                  and the Master, betwixt them
                  and Christ, with whom
                  it were
                  both impious and absurd to make
                  comparisons.
                  It were
                  an
                  endless piece of work to instance in all those several
                  places,
                  wherein the superiority of Bishops
                  over all the flock, is
                  pleaded
                  and declared
                  by this blessed
                  Martyr. I therefore shut up all with this Conclusion,
                
                , Let the Lay-people be subject to
                  the Deacons,
                  the Deacons
                  to the Presbyters,
                  the Presbyters
                  unto the Bishop, and the Bishop unto Christ, as he to
                  his Father: An
                  heavenly and Divine subordination. Not one of all the
                  ancient Fathers,
                  that speaks
                  more clearly
                  and distinctly
                  of the Degrees
                  and Orders
                  in the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> than this
                  blessed
                  Martyr; assigning
                  unto every one his due place and station. If in one
                  place, he calls
                  the Presbyters
                  by the name of <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  as writing
                  unto <hi>Hero,</hi> one of the Deacons
                  of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> it
                  is
                  plain he doth: it was
                  at such time and on such occasion, when he himself
                  being
                  the Bishop of that place was
                  ravished
                  from them;
                  and the chief Government thereof
                  was
                  to them
                  committed,
                  (as in the times
                  of vacancy or absence it hath
                  since been
                  done)
                  which gave
                  them
                  the authority of Bishops,
                  though not the Order.
              </p>
              <p>
                For point of Jurisdiction next,
                
                he gives
                  us first this charge in general. It
                  is
                  expedient,
                  saith
                  he, that whatsoever things
                  you do, , do it not without your
                  Bishop: that is
                  to say, as he expounds
                  himself in another place,
                
                , nothing that
                  appertains
                  unto the Church, or concerns
                  Religion. And this he grounds
                  on the obedience of our Saviour
                  <hi>Christ,</hi>
                
                , who doth not any thing without his
                  Father: resolving
                  finally,
                  that they who give unto their Governour
                  the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi>
                
                , and yet do what they list without
                  him;
                  do in effect, as those did
                  unto Christ our Saviour, who said
                  unto him,
                  <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet did
                  nothing which he said.
                  As for particulars,
                  he would have those which <hi>marry,</hi> or <hi>are
                  given
                  in marriage,</hi>
                
                , to take the Bishop along with
                  them;
                  that so their marriage may be made
                  according
                  unto Gods
                  Commandment, and not for wantonness. The
                  <hi>Eucharist</hi> he would not have
                  performed
                  but by the Bishop; either
                  by him
                  in person, or by his authority; nor <hi>Baptism</hi> to
                  be administred
                  without his licence and permission. This last
                  expresly
                  in his 4th Epistle, being
                  that unto the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                
                It is
                  not lawful without the Bishop, ,
                  <hi>either to</hi> baptize,
                  <hi>or present Oblations,
                  or celebrate the sacrifice of the
                  blessed</hi>
                  Eucharist, <hi>or solemnize the Love
                  feasts;
                  but all things
                  to be done
                  agreeably
                  unto his direction, according
                  to the will and pleasure of Almighty God.</hi> In which
                  as to the Sacrament of Baptism,
                
                <hi>Tertullian</hi> also doth concur; as we shall see
                  hereafter in its
                  proper place: And for the celebrating
                  of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> by himself in person, and the
                  assembling
                  of the people upon his appointment, the same good Father
                  gives
                  it thus.
                
                . <hi>Let that administration of
                  the</hi> Eucharist <hi>be held
                  good and valid, which is
                  done
                  by the Bishop, or such as he permits
                  to do it. And where the</hi> Bishop <hi>shall appear,
                  there let the Congregation be assembled;
                  as where Christ is,
                  there all the Hosts
                  of Heaven do stand round about him.</hi>
                  Those that assemble otherwise than thus, and do not take
                  the Bishop with them
                  in these sacred Actions,
                  are by him
                  said,
                
                to break the concord of the <hi>Church,</hi> and destroy
                  her Order; and consequently
                  are worthy of a greater
                  punishment, than he , which doth
                
                
                rebel against his King. Never did
                  Advocate for his see plead a cause more
                  throughly.
                  So throughly,
                  that I dare take up the Conclusion of that
                  blessed
                  Martyr:
                
                . My Soul for theirs who
                  carefully
                  observe
                  this Order, and keep themselves unto the
                  Rules
                  which are here prescribed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that which by <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  is
                  laid
                  down before us,
                
                as to the ministration of the Sacrament, by the Bishop,
                  in way of <hi>observation</hi> or <hi>direction;</hi>
                  the same we find in <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who
                  lived
                  about the middle of this second Century;
                  exemplified
                  and represented
                  in the way of Practice. For shewing
                  how a Convert was
                  to be admitted
                  in the Congregation, and that he
                  was
                  received
                  with Common Prayers
                  both for himself,
                
                and for the holy Catholick
                  Church, he doth thus proceed. ,
                  <hi>Prayers
                  being
                  done,
                  we salute one another with an
                  holy kiss. Then do we offer Bread and Wine
                  mixt
                  with Water,</hi>  <hi>to the
                  President or Ruler of the brethren; which he
                  receiving,
                  presenteth
                  to the Father of all, by the name of the Son and holy
                  Ghost, the sacrifice of praise and glory,
                  rendring
                  immortal thanks
                  unto him
                  in that he hath
                  vouchsafed
                  those his gifts
                  unto us: who having
                  offered
                  this oblation of Prayer and Thanksgiving, the
                  Congregation present say Amen. The</hi> President
                  <hi>or</hi> 
                  <hi>having
                  done
                  his part, in celebrating
                  of the</hi> Eucharist, <hi>and the People
                  crowning
                  his performance with their best
                  Devotions,</hi>
                  , <hi>those who by us are
                  called</hi>
                  Ministers
                  <hi>or</hi> Deacons
                  (<hi>for both these words
                  the</hi> Latin <hi>useth</hi>)
                  <hi>distribute unto every one there present, a portion
                  of the blessed
                  bread and wine mixt
                  with water, that he may communicate thereof; and also
                  carry part thereof unto such as are absent. Which
                  aliment (being
                  thus consecrated
                  and received)
                  we call the</hi> Eucharist, <hi>and
                  is
                  delivered
                  unto none, but such as do believe our doctrine, and have
                  been
                  washed
                  in the laver of Regeneration. And not long after,
                  making
                  a description of their Assemblies
                  on the Sunday, he first relates
                  that the Commentaries
                  of the Apostles
                  and writings
                  of the Prophets,
                  as much as the time will suffer, are read
                  before
                  them.
                  Then addeth,
                  that the</hi> Reader <hi>having
                  done,</hi>
                  , c. <hi>the</hi> President
                  <hi>or</hi> 
                  <hi>makes
                  a Sermon, wherein he doth instruct the People in the
                  performance of those excellent things,
                  which are contained
                  in the same. Which done
                  we all arise, and make our Prayers
                  unto the Lord, and then the Bread and Wine and
                  Water, as
                  before, is
                  offered:
                  the</hi>  proceeding
                  to the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> according
                  to the manner formerly
                  described.
                  Here then we have the celebration of the
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and the Preaching
                  of Gods
                  holy Word, performed
                  ordinarily
                  by the  or <hi>President</hi> of the
                  Congregation: but what this  should
                  be, is
                  the point in question. For resolution of which doubt, it
                  is
                  clear and evident, that by 
                  anciently
                  was
                  meant
                  the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as may appear by that of
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> calling
                  <hi>Publius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Athens</hi> by this name
                  , as he stiles
                  him
                  there;
                
                and so in other places
                  and in other Writers.
                  Nor do I find that it was
                  any way applyed
                  to inferiour
                  Presbyters,
                  till after the division of the Church into several
                  Parishes,
                  not in some Cities
                  only, but in all parts
                  else; after which times
                  the Presbyters
                  or Ministers
                  of Parochial Churches
                  having
                  cure of Souls,
                  by and from the Bishop, and having
                  got
                  the name of <hi>Rectors;</hi>
                  came
                  to be called
                  in some Writers
                   also, as we shall see hereafter in
                  its
                  proper place. But what need any of the
                  Ancients
                  come in for evidence; when as the matter
                  is
                  confessed
                  by those, who were
                  the greatest
                  adversaries
                  of Episcopacy? For <hi>Beza</hi>
                  making
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom
                  we have proved
                  sufficiently
                  to have been
                  a Bishop, to be the <hi>President</hi> or
                   of the <hi>Ephesine</hi>
                  Presbytery;
                  and such a <hi>President</hi> or ,
                  <hi>ut Justinus vocat,</hi>
                
                as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> speaks
                  of in the present place: it must
                  needs
                  be, that <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi>
                  President or 
                  was
                  a Bishop also, as <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  is
                  proved
                  to be. Which if it be not clear enough, we have a second
                  that speaks
                  plainer,
                  and he the greatest
                  Champion of the adverse Party, which
                  had
                  the honour to be bred
                  in the Church of <hi>England; Cartwright</hi> I mean,
                
                who tells
                  us, with great grief no question, <hi>that even in</hi>
                  Justins <hi>time there began
                  to peep, out something, which went
                  from the simplicity of the Gospel, as that the name
                  of</hi> , <hi>which
                  was
                  common to the</hi> Elders
                  <hi>with the Ministers
                  of the Word, was
                  it seemeth
                  appropriated
                  unto one.</hi> So that by the confession of the
                  Adversaries
                  to Episcopal Government we have
                  gained
                  thus much, that the administration of the Sacrament of
                  the blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> did
                  properly
                  and in chief belong unto the Bishop, as
                  was
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and proved
                  in point of practice out of <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi> And
                  so much for the first half of the second Century; what
                  is
                  presented
                  to us in the other half, we are next to see.

                AMongst those several Writers
                  of the <hi>Primitive</hi> times,
                
                out of whose works
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  collected
                  his materials,
                  for the composing
                  of the Ecclesiastical History, which we still enjoy: one
                  of the antientest
                  was
                  <hi>Egesippus,</hi> one that took
                  great pains
                  in the self-same kind.
                
                Five books
                  he writ, as both <hi>Eusebius</hi> and Saint
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> tell us, touching
                  the <hi>Acts</hi>
                  and <hi>Monuments</hi>
                  of the Church of God: this last
                  affirming
                  of the work, that it contained
                  many things,
                  <hi>ad utilitatem legentium pertinentia,</hi>
                  exceeding
                  profitable to the Reader;
                
                though written
                  in a plain and familiar stile. Some
                  fragments
                  of his cited
                  by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> we have seen
                  before; the body of his Works
                  being
                  eaten
                  by the teeth
                  of Time: and one we are to look on now,
                  being
                  the remainder of a most accurate
                  and full confession of his Faith,
                
                which he left behind him.
                  There he relates,
                  , that in a Journey
                  towards
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> he did
                  confer with many <hi>Bishops;</hi>
                  and that he found amongst them
                  all the same Form of Doctrine: <hi>there
                  being
                  no City where he came,
                  no Episcopal succession, wherein he found not all
                  things
                  so confirmed
                  and setled,
                  as they were
                  prescribed
                  by the Word, taught
                  by the Prophets,
                  and Preached
                  by our Lord and Saviour.</hi> Particularly
                  he tells
                  us of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  , that it continued
                  constantly
                  in the Orthodox Faith, till the time that
                  <hi>Primus</hi> was
                  there <hi>Bishop:</hi> with whom
                  he had
                  much conference, as he sailed
                  towards
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> staying
                  with him
                  many days
                  at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and being
                  much delighted
                  with his Conversation. Of <hi>Rome</hi> he only doth
                  inform us, that he abode there till the time of
                  <hi>Anicetus,</hi> whose Deacon <hi>Eleutherus</hi> at
                  that time was;
                  who not long after did
                  succeed in his Pastors
                  Chair: <hi>Soter</hi> succeeding
                  <hi>Anicetus; Eleutherus</hi> succeeding
                  <hi>Soter.</hi> Where by the way,
                
                I wonder how Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  came
                  to place the coming
                  of <hi>Egesippus</hi> unto <hi>Rome, sub Aniceto,</hi>
                  when <hi>Anicetus</hi> was
                  there <hi>Bishop;</hi> considering
                  that <hi>Egesippus</hi> tells
                  us he was
                  there before; and that he there
                  continued
                  , until the time of
                  <hi>Anicetus,</hi> as before was
                  said.

                  his men,
                  he sheweth

                  as being
                  of their Masters
                  kindred: He addeth

                  (whereof he speaketh)
                  was
                  called
                  for long time, the <hi>Virgin Church;</hi> as
                  being
                  undefiled with the filth of Heresies:
                  and that <hi>Thebulis</hi> was
                  the first who broached
                  strange Doctrine in the same; the man
                  being
                  discontented,
                  as it seemed,
                  , because he
                  was
                  not made
                  a <hi>Bishop.</hi> So far the pieces
                  of this Journal, or <hi>Itinerary</hi> direct us in this
                  present search, as to discern how strong a
                  bulwark the
                  Episcopal succession hath
                  been,
                  and been
                  accounted
                  also, of Gods
                  sacred Truths;
                  how strong a Pillar for support of that
                  blessed
                  building.

                  Eloquence,
                
                
                <hi>ut non solum suae Civitatis  Provinciae

                  the people of his own City and Province, but also those
                  of other Churches.
                  One writ he, saith
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
                  at once confirming
                  them
                  in faith and love: another unto the
                  <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  about the time that <hi>Publius,</hi> their
                  <hi>Bishop,</hi> suffered
                  Martyrdom; exhorting
                  them
                  to live according
                  to the prescript of Christs holy Gospel. In that Epistle
                  he makes
                  mention of <hi>Quadratus</hi> also, who
                  succeeded
                  <hi>Publius</hi> in that charge;
                  declaring
                  also, that <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi>
                  being
                  converted
                  by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was
                  made
                  the first <hi>Bishop</hi> of that City. Of which three
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of <hi>Athens, Quadratus</hi>
                  is
                  much celebrated
                  by <hi>Eusebius</hi> for an
                  Apologie
                  by him
                  written,
                
                and tendred
                  unto <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour,
                  in the behalf of Christians;
                  being
                  the first piece of that kind that
                  was
                  ever written
                  in the World: and written,
                  as it seems,
                  with such power and efficacy,
                
                that shortly
                  after <hi>Adrian</hi> desisted
                  from his persecuting
                  of the Church of God, making
                  a Law or Edict for their future safety. But to go on
                  with <hi>Dionysius.</hi> A third he writ unto the
                  <hi>Nicomedians,</hi> opposing
                  in the same the Heresies
                  of <hi>Marcion:</hi>
                  a fourth unto the <hi>Gortynaeans,</hi> in which he much
                  commended
                  their Bishop <hi>Philip,</hi> in that the Church
                  committed
                  to his care and governance ,
                  had
                  been
                  made
                  famous by so many tryals
                  both for faith and constancy. He writ unto the Church of
                  <hi>Amastris</hi> also, and the rest in <hi>Pontus;</hi>
                  speaking
                  by name of <hi>Palma,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> there: as
                  also to the Church of <hi>Gnossus,</hi> in the Isle of
                  <hi>Crete;</hi> in which he did
                  persuade <hi>Pintus,</hi> Bishop of the same,
                  , not to impose that grievous yoke
                  of Chastity upon his brethren, as a matter necessary;
                  but to consider rather the infirmity and weakness of
                  them.
                  Finally,
                  there was
                  extant in <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s time another Epistle of
                  this <hi>Dionysius,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  wherein he magnifieth their abundant
                  charity
                  towards
                  all the Brethren which were
                  in want or persecution, not only of their own, but of
                  other Cities:
                  highly
                  commending
                  <hi>Soter,</hi> who was
                  then their <hi>Bishop,</hi> who
                  did
                  not only study to preserve them
                  in so good a way, , but also
                  did
                  encourage them
                  to improve their bounties.
                  So much remains
                  of <hi>Dionysius</hi> and his publick
                  Acts:
                  by which we may perceive, that though the
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of those times
                  (as since) had
                  their particular <hi>Sees</hi>
                  and <hi>Cities,</hi>
                  yet did
                  their care extend unto others also;
                  maintaining
                  a continual intercourse betwixt one another, not only
                  for their mutual comfort in those dangerous
                  times,
                  but also for the better government of the Church it
                  self; the Unity whereof was
                  then best preserved
                  by that correspondence which the
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  in the name of their several Churches,
                  had
                  with one another. For other <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of those times,
                  not to say any thing of <hi>Melito</hi> or
                  <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> whom
                  before we spake
                  of; nor of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of the four <hi>Patriarchal Sees,</hi>
                  which we shall have occasion to remember
                  shortly:
                  those of most fame were
                  <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Apollinarius,</hi>
                
                <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  successively
                  of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> a City of <hi>Phrygia;
                  Pothinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in
                  <hi>France;</hi>
                
                <hi>Theophilus</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Caesarea; Cassius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyre;
                  Clarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> all three in
                  <hi>Palestine; Publius Julius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Debelto</hi> a Colony in <hi>Thrace;</hi> with many
                  others of great eminency; whereof consult <hi>Euseb.

              </p>
              <p>
                By this that hath
                  been
                  said
                  of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and other
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of his time,
                
                it is
                  clear and evident, that <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  had
                  been
                  setled
                  even in those early days)
                  in many Cities,
                  wherein we
                  do not find that any had
                  been
                  formerly
                  ordained
                  by the Apostles.
                  But how they were
                  so setled,
                  and by whose authority, hath
                  in these later
                  days
                  been
                  made
                  a question. Our Masters
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> appropriate the power of
                  instituting
                  and erecting
                  new Episcopal Sees,
                  to their <hi>Bishop</hi> only, as
                  being
                  the only, universal and supream
                  Pastor of the Church. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  hath
                  resolved
                  it so, in terms
                  express.
                
                <hi>Apostolorum proprium erat,</hi> It
                  properly
                  pertained
                  (saith
                  he) to the Apostles
                  to constitute Churches,
                  and propagate the Gospel in those
                  Churches
                  wherein it never had
                  been
                  Preached.
                  So far unquestionably
                  true, but what followeth
                  after? <hi>Et hoc ad Romanum Pontificem
                  pertinere,
                   ratio  experientia ipsa nos docet.</hi> And
                  that this doth belong to the Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> both reason and experience teach us.
                  Belong it doth indeed to the Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> so far we dare
                  joyn
                  issue with him:
                  but that it doth belong to the Pope alone, and not to
                  any other <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  but by his sufferance and authority, which
                  is
                  the matter to be proved,
                  that there is
                  neither reason nor example for. No reason
                  certainly,
                  for if this did
                  belong to all the Apostles,
                  as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms
                  it did,
                  then other <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  which derive their pedigree from <hi>Andrew, James,
                  John, Paul,</hi> or any other of the
                  Apostles,
                  have as much interest herein as the
                  Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> who challenge their
                  descent
                  from <hi>Peter.</hi> And for Examples,
                  if they go by that, they have a very desperate cause to
                  manage. 'Tis true indeed, that <hi>Clemens,</hi> one of
                  the first <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of the Church
                
                
                
                of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                did
                  ordain several <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  in his time, and placed
                  them
                  in the chief Cities
                  of those parts
                  of <hi>Gallia</hi> which lay near unto
                  him,
                  as <hi>viz. Photinus</hi> at <hi>Lions,
                  Paul</hi> at <hi>Narbon, Gratian</hi> at <hi>Tours,</hi>
                  others in other places
                  also, as <hi>Ino Carnotensis</hi>
                  hath
                  reported
                  of him.
                  But then it is
                  as true withal, that other <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  did
                  the like in their times
                  and places.
                  Christianity and Episcopacy had
                  not else in so short a time been
                  propagated
                  over all the World; if those which
                  dwelt
                  far off and remote from <hi>Rome,</hi> could not have
                  setled
                  and ordained
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  in convenient places,
                  without running
                  thither, or having
                  a Commission thence. And though we have no precedent
                  hereof, in the present age, yet we may see by the
                  continual practice in the ages
                  following,
                  that <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  were
                  first propagated
                  over all the Churches,
                  by the assistance of such neighbour
                  Churches,
                  in whom
                  there had
                  been
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  instituted
                  either by the Apostles
                  and Evangelists
                  themselves, or by their Successors.
                  <hi>Frumentius</hi> being
                  in some hope of gaining
                  the <hi>Indians</hi>
                  beyond <hi>Ganges</hi> to the faith of Christ,
                  was
                  made
                  a Bishop for that purpose, ,
                
                as the story hath
                  it: not by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor with his
                  privity or consent that we can hear of, but by
                  <hi>Atbanasius</hi> the great and famous
                  Patriarch
                  of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                
                And when <hi>Eusebius Samosatanus</hi>
                  had
                  a mind, for the suppressing
                  of the growth of <hi>Arianism,</hi> to erect
                  <hi>Dolicha</hi>  as my Author
                  calls
                  it, a small City, but greatly
                  pestred
                  with that Heresie,
                  into an
                  Episcopal See: we find not that he
                  sent
                  to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Commission, but
                  actually
                  ordained
                  <hi>Maris,</hi> Bishop of the place; and
                  went
                  himself to see him
                  inthronized
                  in the same. So in like manner Saint <hi>Basil</hi>
                  ordained
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sasima,</hi>
                  making
                  that Town a Bishops
                  See, which before was
                  none:
                
                and thereupon <hi>Gregorius Presbyter</hi>
                  writing
                  the life of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
                  calls
                  it very properly
                  , a Bishoprick
                  or Episcopal See of a new foundation. And thus Saint
                  <hi>Austin</hi> also in the age
                  succeeding
                  erected
                  an
                  Episcopal See in <hi>Fussata,</hi> a City or
                  walled
                  Town in his own Diocess
                  of <hi>Hippo,</hi> making
                  one <hi>Antonius</hi> the first Bishop there,
                
                the Primate of <hi>Numidia</hi>
                  returning
                  with him
                  in the Ordination. Nor did
                  they this, as fain the Cardinal would have it,
                  <hi> sede
                  Apostolica facultatem
                  habentes,</hi> by force of any faculty
                  procured
                  from <hi>Rome;</hi> which is
                  <hi>gratis dictum:</hi> but by their own proper and
                  innate authority, as they were
                  trusted
                  with the Government
                  of the Church of Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                So then the Bishops
                  only of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  had
                  not the sole authority of instituting
                  Bishops,
                
                where none were
                  before. That's a dream only of the <hi>Pontifician.</hi>
                  Authority
                  they had
                  to do it, as had
                  others also; and hereof doth occur a notable and signal
                  evidence in this present Age: <hi>viz.</hi> the
                  setling
                  of the Church of <hi>Britain,</hi> and
                  planting
                  Bishops
                  in the same by Pope <hi>Eleutherius.</hi>
                
                Of him
                  it is
                  affirmed
                  in the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> ascribed
                  to <hi>Damasus,</hi> (who lived
                  about the year 370.) <hi>accepisse Epistolam
                  </hi> Lucio <hi>Britannico
                  Rege, ut Christianus efficeretur per ejus mandatum;</hi>
                  that he received
                  an
                  Epistle from <hi>Lucius</hi> a <hi>British</hi> King,
                  desiring
                  that by his authority he might be
                  made
                  a Christian: Our venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> a right
                  ancient Writer, thus reports
                  the story. <hi>Anno ab incarnatione
                  Domini</hi> 156;
                
                <hi>c.</hi> In the 156 year after Christs Nativity,
                  <hi>Marcus Antonius Verus</hi>
                  together with <hi>Aurelius Commodus</hi> his brother,
                  did
                  in the fourteenth
                  place from <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> undertake the
                  Government of the Empire. In whose
                  times,
                  when as <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a godly man
                  was
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Rome, Lucius</hi> King of
                  the <hi>Britains</hi> sent
                  unto him,
                  <hi>obsecrans ut per ejus mandatum Christianus
                  efficeretur,</hi> intreating
                  by his means
                  to be made
                  a Christian; whose vertuous
                  desire herein was
                  granted;
                  and the faith of Christ being
                  thus received
                  by the <hi>Britains,</hi> was
                  by them
                  kept
                  inviolate
                  and undefiled until the times
                  of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> Wherein as I submit to
                  <hi>Beda,</hi> as to the substance of the story, so I
                  crave leave to differ from him
                  as to the matter of <hi>Chronologie.</hi>
                  For by this reckoning
                  <hi>Eleutherius</hi> must attain the Popedom
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 167. as <hi>Beda</hi> elsewhere doth
                  compute it;
                
                which is
                  ten years
                  at least before the time assigned
                  him
                  by most other Writers.
                  And therefore I shall rather chuse
                  to follow the commonly
                  received
                  account, by which the said
                  two Emperours
                  are brought
                  upon the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 161. and the attaining
                  of the Popedom by this <hi>Eleutherius</hi>
                  is
                  placed
                  in the 17th year of <hi>Mareus, Anno</hi> 177.
                  <hi>Lucius Aurelius Commodus</hi>
                  being
                  dead before. But in this Controversie,
                  as it belongeth
                  to <hi>Chronology,</hi> I shall not meddle at the
                  present. It is
                  enough, that the planting
                  of the Gospel amongst
                  the <hi>Britains,</hi> was,
                  as the greatest,
                  so the first action of this Pope,
                  done
                  by him,
                  as we read in <hi>Platina,</hi>
                
                <hi>inito pontificatu,</hi> at his first entrance on the
                  place: wherein <hi>Philippus Bergomensis</hi> in
                  <hi>Supplemento Chronicorum, l.</hi> 8. and <hi>Cocc.
                  Sabellicus, Ennead.</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 5. do either
                  follow him,
                
                or concur with him.
                  How <hi>Lucius</hi> came
                  to be inflamed
                  with this holy zeal, is
                  related
                  diversly.
                  <hi>Nicolas Harpsfield</hi> doth conceive it to be on
                
                
                occasion of the great Miracle then
                  lately
                  done
                  by the Christian Legion, obtaining
                  rain from Heaven by their fervent
                  prayers,
                  on the Imperial Army much distressed
                  with drought; by means
                  whereof the Emperors
                  dealt
                  very favourably
                  with the Christians,
                  <hi>adjecta etiam accusatoribus
                  damnatione,</hi>
                  even to the condemnation of their false
                  Accusers.
                
                Others conceive, that being
                  in himself of a sweet and gratious
                  disposition, he was
                  much taken
                  with the reports
                  that had
                  come unto him,
                  <hi>de miraculis Christi,</hi>
                
                <hi> praedicatione
                  Apostolorum,</hi> touching
                  the miracles
                  of Christ, and the preaching
                  of his holy Apostles.
                  And possibly
                  it might be both, one adding
                  help and strength unto the other. But whichsoever it
                  was,
                  it seemeth
                  he was
                  not very forward at the first to
                  imbrace
                  the Gospel, being
                  retarded
                  from the same by the obscure and poor condition of the
                  Christians.
                  But when he had
                  been
                  well informed
                  by <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Trebellius,</hi>
                
                Lieutenants
                  in this Island for the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperors,
                  <hi>Romanorum illustres aliquot illam
                  admifisse,</hi>
                  that many men
                  of mark amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  had
                  received
                  the faith; he then resolved
                  to go through with his good intentions.
                  <hi>And being
                  so resolved,</hi>
                
                <hi>he dispatched
                  away</hi> Eluanus
                  <hi>and</hi> Maduinus, Britans
                  <hi>both, and both initiated
                  in the faith, to Pope</hi> Eleutherius;
                  <hi>who giving
                  thanks
                  to God for so great a blessing,
                  did
                  first of all Baptize
                  the Legates
                  or Ambassadors;
                  and having
                  Consecrated</hi>
                  Eluanus
                  <hi>Bishop, and fitted</hi>
                  Meduinus <hi>for a Doctor, or an
                  instructer of the people, or made
                  him
                  Presbyter, as I conceive the meaning
                  of the place to be, he sent
                  them
                  back again to</hi> Lucius. <hi>The issue of the business
                  was,</hi>
                  eorum praedicatione
                  <hi>Lucius,</hi>  totius <hi>Britanniae</hi>
                  primates
                  baptismum susceperunt, <hi>that by their
                  preaching,
                  both</hi> Lucius <hi>and all the
                  Noblemen
                  of</hi> Britain <hi>received
                  the Sacrament of Baptism; and that
                  according
                  to the order of the said</hi>
                  Eleutherius, <hi>the State Ecclesiastical
                  was
                  established,
                  Bishops
                  ordained,
                  and the rules
                  of godly living
                  shewed
                  unto the people.</hi> Nor did
                  he trust this work to those two alone, but he
                  sent
                  with them
                  others also, <hi>Faganus,</hi>
                
                and <hi>Deruvianus</hi> (or <hi>Damianus,</hi> as some
                  call him)
                  to assist the work, and contribute their best
                  endeavours
                  to so great a business, as most of our
                  Historians
                  witness.
              </p>
              <p>
                This though it were
                  a notable and signal work,
                
                and that we stand indebted
                  for it unto the piety and zeal of that holy Pope; yet
                  was
                  not this the planting
                  of the Gospel here, but the watering
                  of it. The planting
                  of it was
                  before, perhaps before it had
                  been
                  planted
                  even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self. <hi>Gildas,</hi>
                
                one of the notedst
                  Antiquaries
                  of the British Nation doth affirm
                  expresly,
                  <hi>Tempore, ut scimus, summo Tiberii Caesaris,</hi>
                  that in the latter days
                  of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> our Saviour Christ the Sun
                  of righteousness had
                  with his beams
                  enlightened
                  this frozen
                  Island, and that his Gospel was
                  here propagated
                  without let
                  or hinderance. Now Christ our Saviour
                  suffered
                  in the 18th. year of this <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and he
                  again deceased
                  in the 39th. of our Saviour; so that the faith of Christ
                  was
                  at the furthest
                  preached
                  unto the <hi>Britains</hi> within five
                  years
                  after the bitter passion of our Lord Christ Jesus.
                  Whether at <hi>Rome</hi> so soon, or not, let
                  them
                  prove that can. That it was
                  here so early, we have shewed
                  a proof above all exception; and yet we have one more to
                  come as little liable to exception, in the opinion of
                  the Romanists
                  as that before. It is
                  a passage extant in <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                
                and by him
                  borrowed
                  from the Acts
                  or History of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and her
                  Associats;
                  which tells
                  us this, that after the dispersion
                  of the Disciples
                  on the death of <hi>Steven, Lazarus, Mary Magdalen,
                  Martha,</hi> and <hi>Marcella, in quos Judaei majori
                  odio exardescebant,</hi> against
                  whom
                  the Jews
                  were
                  more incensed
                  than against any of the rest, were
                  not only thrust out of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  but together with one <hi>Maximinus,</hi> one of the
                  Disciples,
                  put into a Boat without Oars,
                  and so committed
                  unto the mercy, or the fury rather of the Sea, but
                  were
                  at last by Gods
                  great providence brought
                  unto <hi>Marseilles</hi> in safety, together with
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who
                  made
                  himself a partner in the danger with
                  them,
                  and after went
                  from <hi>Gaul</hi> to <hi>Britain, illicque post
                  praedicatum Evangelium, diem clausit extremum,</hi>
                  where having
                  Preached
                  the Gospel, he did
                  end his days.
                  With this, as for the time of <hi>Josephs</hi>
                  coming
                  into <hi>Britain,</hi> agreeth
                  the argument made
                  by the English Ambassadors
                  at the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi>
                
                upon occasion of a controversie
                  therein agitated,
                  touching
                  the dignity and greatness of the
                  Kingdoms
                  of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> In which it
                  was
                  thus pleaded
                  by the <hi>English</hi> Advocates,
                  <hi>statim post passionem Christi,</hi> that
                  presently
                  on the passion of Christ, <hi>Joseph</hi> of
                  <hi>Arimathea</hi> that noble Counsellor, who
                  took
                  our Saviour from the Cross, that he might early in the
                  morning apply himself unto the dressing
                  of the Lords
                  Vineyard, came
                  with his twelve Associates
                  into <hi>England</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> that part of
                  <hi>Britain</hi> which was
                  then called
                  <hi>England</hi>) and converted
                  the People of it to the Faith. And this I take,
                
                building upon the words
                  of <hi>Gildas,</hi>
                  to be more consonant to the truth of story, than to put
                  off his coming
                  hither unto the 63. year after Christs Nativity, or the
                  20. after his Ascension, as some of our
                  Historians
                  do, on far less Authority. But being
                  come, and
                
                
                
                having
                  Preached
                  the Gospel here, as it is
                  generally
                  delivered
                  by our ancient writers,
                  he retired
                  himself unto the Isle of <hi>Avalonia,</hi>
                
                which we now call <hi>Glassenbury,</hi>
                  and there applyed
                  himself unto his devotions;
                  leaving
                  the work by him
                  begun,
                  to receive a further
                  measure of perfection both from S. <hi>Peter</hi> who
                  was
                  here in person, and from <hi>Aristobulus</hi>
                  whom
                  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sent
                  hither, as before was
                  said.
                  And though we do not find any evident footstep, that
                  either <hi>Aristobulus</hi> being
                  ordained
                  Bishop of the <hi>Britains,</hi> or that those
                  Bishops
                  who are said
                  to have been
                  ordained
                  by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> left any to succeed
                  them
                  in that sacred office; or that Religion
                  had
                  gained
                  much upon the People of this Island,
                  being
                  then hardly
                  civilized,
                  and almost continually
                  in wars
                  and troubles:
                  Yet did
                  the Sceleton
                  or carkass
                  of it continue still from this time
                  forwards,
                  even to the days
                  of <hi>Dioclesian;</hi>
                
                sure I am
                  <hi>Gildas</hi>
                  doth expresly
                  say it, that howsoever the Gospel
                  was
                  received
                  here but very coldly
                  at the first, <hi>apud quosdam tamen integre, apud alios
                  minus, usque ad persecutionem Diocletiani tyranni
                  novennem,</hi> yet it continued
                  amongst some in greater,
                  with others in a less perfection, until the nine
                  years
                  Persecution raised
                  by <hi>Dioclesian.</hi>
                
                And questionless from this old brood of
                  Christians
                  <hi>Eluanus</hi>
                  and <hi>Meduinus</hi>
                  before remembred
                  (whereof the one is
                  called
                  <hi>Avalonus,</hi> the other <hi>Belga,</hi> this
                  being
                  the old name of that sept or nation, to which the Isle
                  of <hi>Avalonia</hi> in those times
                  belonged)
                  receive their first affections
                  to the Faith of Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                But of this little question hath
                  been
                  raised
                  amongst our Antiquaries.
                
                The greatest
                  scruple is
                  concerning
                  <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the number of Episcopal
                  Sees
                  by him
                  erected,
                  whom
                  the opposers
                  of this story allow not to be King of <hi>Britain,</hi>
                  which was
                  reduced
                  at that time to a <hi>Roman</hi> Province; and so by
                  consequence of no ability to build so many
                  Christian
                  Churches,
                  and endow the same, for the advancement of a Religion
                  not publickly
                  allowed
                  of in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But this, as I
                  conceive, is
                  no such objection, but what may
                  easily
                  be answered,
                  considering
                  what was
                  vouched
                  out of <hi>Bede,</hi> before, the
                  ancientest
                  writer of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and no great
                  friend unto the <hi>British.</hi> For they that know the
                  customs
                  of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
                
                know this well enough, that nothing
                  was
                  more usual with them,
                  <hi>quam habere instrumenta servitutis, 
                  Reges,</hi> than to permit Kings
                  in the conquered
                  Countries,
                  making
                  them
                  to be helps
                  and instruments
                  for bringing
                  the People into bondage. And they that know the
                  passages
                  of the present times
                  cannot choose but tell that <hi>Lucius Verus</hi>
                  living
                  in the times
                  whereof we speak, having
                  put an
                  end unto the War against the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
                
                <hi>regna Regibus, provincias vero
                  Comitibus
                  suis regendas dedisse,</hi> did
                  give those Kingdoms
                  which he had
                  subdued
                  to be ruled
                  by Kings;
                  the Provinces
                  to be ruled
                  by Earls
                  or Counts.
                  So that our <hi>Lucius</hi> might be very well a King in
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> notwithstanding the reduction of it to
                  a <hi>Roman</hi> Province;
                  especially
                  considering
                  that besides
                  his birth-right, he was
                  confirmed
                  in the same.
                
                <hi>M. Antonini Veri
                  tum benevolenti, cum authoritate,</hi> both by
                  the power and favour
                  of <hi>M. Antoninus Verus,</hi> then the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperour.
                  A King then <hi>Lucius</hi> was,
                  and a King in <hi>Britain;</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> as a
                  King of some part thereof, such as <hi>Pratusagus</hi>
                  and <hi>Cordigunus,</hi>
                
                of whom
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaketh,
                  had
                  been
                  before; but not a King of <hi>Britain,</hi> as of all
                  the Island, it being
                  probable that there were
                  other petty Kings
                  and Roytelets as well as he. But as it
                  hapned
                  after in the <hi>Saxon Heptarchie,</hi>
                  that he which was
                  more eminent than the rest for power and puissance,
                  was
                  called
                  commonly
                  <hi>Rex Gentis Anglorum,</hi>
                  the King or Monarch of the <hi>English</hi> Nation: So I
                  conceive, that of these tributary
                  Kings
                  in <hi>Britain,</hi> such as were
                  in their several times
                  of more power than others, assumed
                  unto themselves the stile or title of <hi>Reges
                  Britannorum,</hi> the Kings
                  of the <hi>Britains,</hi> by which name of <hi>Rex
                  Britannorum,</hi> and not <hi>Rex Britanniae,
                  Lucius</hi> is
                  called
                  in <hi>Beda,</hi> as before was
                  said:
                  And thus then the seeming
                  difficulty may be better solved
                  than by running
                  out I know not whither, beyond the
                  territories
                  of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  to look for <hi>Lucius</hi> in the North
                  parts
                  of the Isle which we now call <hi>Scotland;</hi> only
                  because it is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                
                <hi>Britannorum inaccessa Romanis loca, Christo esse
                  subdita,</hi> that those remoter
                  parts
                  of Britain which never had
                  been
                  Conquered
                  by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  were
                  subdued
                  to Christ; which might well be after the Gospel
                  had
                  been
                  first received
                  in the Southern Countreys.
                  In which, as I can no way blame the
                  <hi>Scots</hi>
                  for seeking
                  to appropriate
                  this honour to their own part of the Island; so can I
                  not but wonder at our Learned
                  <hi>Camden,</hi>
                
                that without seeing
                  better cards,
                  he should so easily
                  give up such an
                  hopeful game. As for the name of <hi>Lucius,</hi> it
                  is
                  meerly
                  <hi>Latine,</hi>
                  and that derived
                  upon him
                  either from the British <hi>Llos</hi>
                  (fashioned
                  on the <hi>Roman</hi> anvil) as in that language he

                  or taken
                  up from <hi>Lucius Verus,</hi> one of the
                  partners
                  in the Empire at that very time, unto which family he
                  stood
                  indebted
                  for his Crown and dignity, or given
                  him
                  else upon the post-fact, after the glorious light of
                  truth had
                  shined
                  on him,

                <hi>propter fidem quae in ejus tempore venit,</hi> by
                  reason of the faith which in his time
                  was
                  brought
                  into this Island.

              <p>
                But to go forwards
                  with our story: <hi>Lucius</hi> and his
                  Nobles
                  being
                  thus Baptized,
                
                <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Deruvianus</hi> return to
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> giving
                  to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> an
                  account of their great success; of
                  whom
                  being
                  joyfully
                  received,
                  and their Acts
                  applauded,
                  they returned
                  back again to <hi>Britain,</hi>
                  accompanied
                  with many others,
                
                <hi>quorum doctrina gens Britonum in fide Christi in
                  brevi fundata refulsit,</hi> by whose assiduous
                  preaching
                  the whole British Nation became
                  in very little time to be well setled
                  and confirmed
                  in the faith of Christ. Now at this time of their repair
                  unto the Pope, I conceive it was,
                  that they received
                  instructions
                  from him,
                  for dealing
                  with that godly King to found Episcopal
                  Sees
                  in the most convenient places
                  of his Dominions;
                  themselves receiving
                  at that time, in all probability, the Episcopal
                  Character. For after this I find
                  them
                  honoured
                  with the name of Bishops,
                  being
                  by <hi>Rodburn</hi> in his Chronicle
                  called
                  <hi>Antistites,</hi>
                
                and by the Author
                  of the book entituled
                  <hi>De Antiquitatibus Ecclesiae Wintoniensis,</hi> in
                  plain terms
                  <hi>Episcopi:
                  Faganus</hi> being
                  further said
                  by some to have been
                  made
                  the first Arch-Bishop of the See of <hi>York.</hi>
                  Being
                  returned
                  into Britain, and the King throughly
                  established
                  in the faith of Christ, it was
                  no difficult matter to persuade
                  him
                  to turn the Temples
                  of the Idols
                  into Christian Churches,
                  and to appropriate the revenues
                  of them
                  to more pious uses.
                  And this he did,
                  as <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi>
                  observes,
                
                although he differ from us in his calculation, the very
                  next year after their return from <hi>Rome.
                  Gloriosus
                  Rex Britonum Lucius,</hi> c. <hi>Lucius</hi> the
                  glorious King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> when he
                  had
                  seen
                  the faith of Christ dispersed
                  and propagated
                  over his dominions,
                  <hi>possessiones  territoria Ecclesiis  viris
                  Ecclesiasticis abundanter conferens,</hi>
                  bestowing
                  with a liberal hand possessions
                  and revenues
                  both on Church and Church-men,
                  did
                  ratifie
                  the said
                  donations
                  by his publick
                  Charters.
                  And this he saith
                  on the Authority of <hi>Gildas,</hi>
                  who in a book of his, entituled
                  <hi>De victoria Aurelii Ambrosii,</hi> not now extant,
                  had
                  affirmed
                  the same. <hi>Radulphus
                  de Diceto</hi> speaks
                  more fully
                  to the point in hand: <hi>Eleutherus,</hi>
                  saith
                  he,
                
                sent
                  into <hi>Britain Faganus</hi> and <hi>Diwanus</hi> (for
                  so he calls
                  him)
                  who having
                  Baptized
                  <hi>Lucius</hi> the King, <hi>templa etiam quae in
                  honorem plurimorum deorum fundata erant,</hi>
                  did
                  dedicate unto
                  the one and only God those Temples
                  which had
                  been
                  built
                  in former times
                  to the honour of Idols.
                  More fully,
                  yet in fewer
                  words,
                  <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> doth relate it
                  thus: <hi>Hic Lucius omnia territoria, templis pridem
                  collata, contulit Ecclesiis,  ampliavit:</hi>
                
                This <hi>Lucius,</hi> saith
                  he, bestowed
                  upon the Churches
                  those Lands
                  and Territories
                  which had
                  been
                  formerly
                  conferred
                  on the <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples,
                  and inlarged
                  them
                  also. So that we find the Church
                  indowed,
                  and Bishops
                  instituted
                  in the time of <hi>Lucius;</hi> and that I hold to be
                  above all exception, as will appear more
                  evidently
                  by the Episcopal succession,
                  reckoned
                  from this time; but whether in so large a number, and
                  upon that occasion, as it is
                  laid
                  before us in our common Chroniclers,
                  that is
                  the point to be considered.
                  Now our Historians,
                  old and new, very few excepted,
                  report that in those times
                  in <hi>Britain</hi> there were
                  no less than 28 Cities
                  of name and eminency, whereof 25
                  had
                  anciently
                  been
                  the seats
                  of the Heathen <hi>Flamines,</hi> the three
                  remaining,
                  <hi>viz. York, London,</hi> and <hi>Caer-Leon</hi> upon
                  <hi>Uske,</hi> of the <hi>Archiflamines;</hi> and that
                  upon the introduction of the Gospel hither, the
                  Temples
                  of the Idols
                  being
                  turned
                  into Christian Churches,
                  instead of <hi>Flamines</hi> they
                  placed
                  Bishops,
                  Archbishops
                  in the place of the <hi>Archi-Flamines.</hi> All our own
                  Writers
                  which speak of the foundation of these
                  Bishopricks,
                  from <hi>Geofry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> down to
                  <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> do report it thus, And so do
                  many forrein
                  also, beginning
                  with <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> who first
                  took
                  it up, and so descending
                  down to <hi>Platina,</hi> and since to other
                  later
                  Authors,
                  both ours
                  and theirs. <hi>Erant tunc in</hi> Britannia <hi>vig
                  inti octo Pontifices Idolorum, quos</hi> Flamines
                  <hi>vocabant; inter quos tres</hi> Archiflamines
                  <hi>erant.</hi>
                
                <hi>Sed praedicti Sancti</hi> (that
                  is,
                  <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Deruvianus</hi>) <hi>de mandato
                  Apostolici, ubi erant</hi> Flamines, <hi>instituerunt
                  Episcopos; ubi</hi> Archiflamines,
                  <hi>Archiepiscopos.</hi> We had
                  the same before in <hi>England,</hi> save that the
                  Popes
                  appointment <hi>(mandatum Apostolici)</hi> doth here
                  occur, which there we had
                  not. And how far this may stand with probability, or
                  with truth of story, is
                  in the next place to be looked
                  on.
              </p>
              <p>
                And for the number of them
                  first,
                
                it cannot be denied
                  but that of old there were
                  no less than 28 Cities
                  in these parts
                  of <hi>Britain</hi> which we now call <hi>England.</hi>
                
                <hi>Beda</hi> affirms
                  it so expresly,
                  <hi>Erat  viginti octo Civitatibus quondam
                  nobilissimis insignita,</hi> that <hi>Britain</hi>
                  anciently
                  was
                  ennobled
                  with 28 signal and noted
                  Cities,
                  besides
                  Towns
                  and Castles.
                  <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> doth not only
                  declare as much,
                
                but lets
                  us know the several names
                  whereby they had
                  been
                  called
                  in the <hi>Britains</hi> time; and by the which the most
                  of them
                
                
                
                were
                  known
                  in the later
                  Ages,
                  when he lived.
                  And possibly
                  there might be Bishops
                  in them
                  all, according
                  as the Gospel did
                  inlarge
                  its
                  borders,
                  and Provinces
                  were
                  gained
                  to the Faith of Christ; though neither all so early as
                  the days
                  of <hi>Lucius,</hi> nor all of his foundation and
                  endowment, as it is
                  supposed.
                  It was
                  a work too mighty for a petty Prince to spread his
                  arms
                  at once over all the Island, especially
                  so many Provinces
                  thereof being
                  none of his. What might be done
                  in times
                  succeeding,
                  and by his example,
                  is
                  not now the question; nor whether that which
                  was
                  done
                  after, might in some sort be ascribed
                  to him,
                  as being
                  the first that gave
                  the on-set, and shewed
                  the way to others, how to do the like; as <hi>Rome</hi>
                  is
                  said
                  to have been
                  built
                  by <hi>Romulus,</hi> because
                  he began
                  it, the greatest
                  part thereof being
                  built
                  a long time after. And this seems
                  probable to me,
                
                as to the number of the Sees
                  Episcopal, that there were
                  so many, because that <hi>Gregory</hi> the great by his
                  constitution, appointed
                  twelve Bishops
                  for the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and twelve also
                  unto that of <hi>York,</hi> which with the four in
                  <hi>Wales,</hi>
                  which are still remaining,
                  will make up eight and twenty in the total. But for the
                  <hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamines,</hi> I must
                  confess I am
                  not so well satisfied
                  in the probability
                  and truth of that. That by the name of <hi>Flamines</hi>
                  the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  used
                  to call the Priests
                  of their several Gods,
                
                I know well enough. <hi>Socerdotes Gentilium Flamines
                  dicebantur,</hi>
                  as it is
                  in <hi>Isidore.</hi> But being
                  that one and the same City had
                  not only many <hi>Flamines,</hi> but also many
                  Colleges
                  of <hi>Flamines,</hi> according
                  to the number of the Gods
                  they worshipped,
                  some for <hi>Mars,</hi> others for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and
                  some for <hi>Romulus;</hi> and that there
                  is
                  no ancient Writer of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  stories
                  which mentioneth
                  either <hi>Archiflamines</hi> or <hi>Protoflamines,</hi>
                
                as is
                  objected
                  very well by B. <hi>Godwin:</hi> I must confess I
                  am
                  not so well satisfied
                  in this point, as to deliver it for a certain and
                  undoubted truth. He that desires
                  to see what may be answered
                  unto those objections,
                  let him
                  consult the learned
                  and laborious work of <hi>Francis Mason,</hi>
                
                late Archdeacon of <hi>Norfolk, De Ministerio
                  Anglicano,</hi>
                  the sum whereof in brief is
                  this, <hi>Licet in una urbe multi Flamines,</hi> that
                  though there were
                  many <hi>Flamines</hi> in one City, yet
                  was
                  there only one which was
                  called
                  <hi>Pontifex,</hi>
                  or <hi>Primus Flaminum,</hi> the Pope or principal of
                  the <hi>Flamines;</hi> of which kind one for every City
                  were
                  those whom
                  our Historians
                  speak of: And for the <hi>Archiflamines,</hi> or
                  <hi>Proto-Flamines,</hi>
                
                though the name occur not, yet were
                  there some in power and authority
                  above the rest, who were
                  entituled
                  <hi>primi Pontificum,</hi> (as indeed <hi>Coifi,</hi> by
                  that name is
                  called
                  in <hi>Beda</hi>) which is
                  the same in sense with <hi>Archiflamines,</hi> although
                  not in sound. This if it satisfie
                  the Reader, shall not thwart with me, who
                  am
                  no enemy unto the story, or any part thereof, which may
                  well be justified.
                  If not, but that it rather be accounted
                  a device of <hi>Monkish</hi> ignorance, I shall desire
                  them
                  who are so opinionated
                  to consider this, that few of the
                  records
                  of those elder days
                  have come entire unto our hands;
                  and that it is
                  no marvel it such an
                  ancient story as this is
                  (considering
                  through whose hands
                  it passed)
                  hath
                  in so long a tract of time contracted
                  somewhat of that rust and rubbish wherewith the middle
                  ages
                  of the Church did
                  so much abound.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet if mine own opinion were
                  demanded
                  in it,
                
                though I agree unto the story, both for the number of
                  the Bishops
                  and the Metropolitans,
                  I must needs
                  think there was
                  some other reason for it than the relation of the number
                  of the <hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Archiflamines,</hi>
                  which is
                  there pretended:
                  And that this was
                  not done
                  at once, but in a longer
                  tract of time than the Reign of <hi>Lucius,</hi> as
                  was
                  in part affirmed
                  before. That <hi>Lucius</hi> did
                  convert the Temples
                  of the Idols
                  into Christian Churches,
                  setled
                  the revenues
                  of the same upon the Churches
                  by him
                  founded,
                  I shall easily
                  grant, so far forth as the bounds
                  of his dominions
                  will give way unto it; but being
                  there were
                  but 28 Cities
                  in all that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which we now call
                  <hi>England,</hi> as both from <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and
                  <hi>Beda</hi> was
                  before delivered;
                  and that King <hi>Lucius</hi> was
                  but a Tributary Prince of those
                  Regions
                  only, which were
                  inhabited
                  by the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> and <hi>Cattieuchlani,</hi>
                  as I do verily
                  conceive he was:
                  I believe rather that the number of the
                  Bishops
                  and Archbishops
                  which our stories
                  speak of, related
                  to the form of government, as it
                  was
                  afterwards
                  established
                  in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
                
                and not to any other cause whatever. Now they which have
                  delivered
                  to us the state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, inform us
                  this: That for the easier
                  government and administration of the same, it
                  was
                  divided
                  into fourteen Diocesses
                  (for so they called
                  those greater
                  portions
                  into the which it was
                  divided:)
                  every Diocess
                  being
                  subdivided
                  into several Provinces,
                  and every Province in the same conteining
                  many several Cities.
                  And they which have delivered
                  to us the estate of the Christian Church,
                
                have informed
                  us this, that in each City of the Empire,
                  wherein the
                  <hi>Romans</hi>
                  had
                  a <hi>Defensor Civitatis</hi> (as they
                  called
                  that Magistrate) the Christians
                  when they gain'd that City to the holy faith,
                  did
                  ordain a Bishop, that over every
                
                
                Province in which the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  had
                  their Presidents,
                  they did
                  place an
                  Arch-bishop, whose seat being
                  commonly
                  in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Province,
                  gave
                  him
                  the name of <hi>Metropolitan:</hi> and
                  finally
                  that in every Diocess
                  in which the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  had
                  their <hi>Vicarius,</hi>
                  or Lieutenant-General, the Christians
                  also had
                  their <hi>Primate,</hi> and seated
                  him
                  in the same City also where the other
                  was.
                  This ground thus layed,
                  it will appear upon
                  examination, that <hi>Britain</hi> in the time of the
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was
                  a full Diocese of it self, no way
                  depending
                  upon any other portion of that mighty State,
                
                as any way subordinate thereunto. And
                  being
                  a Diocese in it self, it was
                  divided
                  in those times
                  into these three Provinces,
                  <hi>viz. Britannia prima,</hi>
                
                containing
                  all the Countrys
                  on the South of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and those
                  inhabited
                  by the <hi>Trinobantes, Cattieuchlani,</hi> and
                  <hi>Iceni:</hi> 2. <hi>Britannia secunda,</hi>
                  comprising
                  all the Nations
                  within the <hi>Severn:</hi> and 3. <hi>Maxima
                  Caesariensis,</hi> which comprehended
                  all the residue to the Northern border. In the which
                  Provinces
                  there were
                  no less than 28 Cities,
                  as before is
                  said;
                  of which <hi>York</hi> was
                  the chief in <hi>Maxima Caesariensis; London</hi> the
                  principal in <hi>Britannia prima; Caer-Leon</hi> upon
                  <hi>Usk,</hi> being
                  the <hi>Metropolis</hi> in <hi>Britannia secunda.</hi>
                  And so we have a plain and apparent reason, not only of
                  the 28 Episcopal Sees,
                  erected
                  anciently
                  in the <hi>British</hi> Church; but why three of
                  them,
                  and three only, should be <hi>Metropolitans.</hi>
                  For howsoever after this there were
                  two other Provinces
                  taken
                  out of the former three, <hi>viz. Valentia</hi> and
                  <hi>Flavia Caesariensis,</hi> which
                  added
                  to the former,
                
                made
                  up five in all: yet this being
                  after the conclusion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, the
                  <hi>Metropolitan</hi> dignity
                  in the Church remained
                  as before it did,
                  without division or abatement, according
                  to the <hi>Canon</hi> of that famous Synod.
                
                And herewithal we have a pregnant and infallible
                  Argument, that <hi>Britain</hi>
                  being
                  in it self a whole and compleat
                  Diocese of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, no way subordinate
                  unto the <hi>Praefect</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  but under the command of its
                  own <hi>Vicarius</hi> or Lieutenant-General; the
                  <hi>British</hi> Church was
                  also absolute and independent, owing
                  nor suit nor service, as we use to say,
                  unto the
                  Patriarch or Primate of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
                  only to its
                  own peculiar and immediate Primate, as it
                  was
                  elsewhere in the Churches
                  of the other Dioceses
                  of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. This I conceive to be the
                  true condition of the <hi>British</hi> Church, and the
                  most likely reason for the number of
                  Bishops
                  and Arch-bishops
                  here established,
                  according
                  to the truth of Story, abstracted
                  from those errours
                  and mistakes,
                  which in the middle Ages
                  of the Church, have by the <hi>Monkish</hi>
                  Writers
                  of those times
                  been
                  made
                  up with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                But for the substance of the story, as by
                  them
                  delivered,
                
                which is
                  the planting
                  of the Church with Bishops
                  in eminent places,
                  that appears
                  evidently
                  true by such remainders
                  of antiquity as have escaped
                  the tyranny and wrack of time. For in the Council
                  held
                  at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France, Anno</hi> 314.
                
                we find three <hi>British</hi> Bishops
                  at once subscribing,
                  <hi>viz. Eborius Bish.</hi> of <hi>York, Restitutus
                  B.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Adelfus B.</hi> of
                  <hi>Colchester,</hi>
                  there called
                  <hi>Colonia Londinensium. Gennadius</hi> also, in his
                  Tract, <hi>de viris illustribus,</hi>
                  mentioneth
                  one <hi>Fastidius,</hi> by the name of <hi>Fastidius
                  Britanniarum Episcopus,</hi>
                
                amongst the famous Writers
                  of old time, placing
                  him
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 420, or thereabouts;
                  whom
                  <hi>B. God. win</hi> I cannot tell upon what
                  reasons,
                
                reckoneth
                  amongst the Bishops
                  of the See of <hi>London.</hi> Particularly
                  for the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  or <hi>Archbishops</hi>
                  of the <hi>British</hi> Church, we have a Catalogue of
                  the <hi>Metropolitans</hi>
                  of <hi>London</hi> collected
                  or made
                  up by <hi>Joceline,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Fournest,</hi>
                  an
                  ancient Monastery in the <hi>North,</hi>
                  being
                  14 in all: which, howsoever the validity thereof may
                  perhaps be questioned
                  by more curious Wits,
                  yet I shall lay down as I find it:
                  taking
                  their names
                  from him;
                  that little story which concerns
                  them,
                  out of other Writers.
                  First then we have <hi>Theon</hi> or <hi>Theonus:</hi> 2
                  <hi>Eluanus,</hi>
                  one of the two Ambassadours
                  sent
                  by King <hi>Lucius</hi> to the Pope. 3 <hi>Cadar</hi> or
                  <hi>Cadoeus:</hi> 4 <hi>Obinus</hi> or <hi>Owinus:</hi>

                12 <hi>Guitelinus</hi> sent
                  as Ambassadour
                  to <hi>Aldrocnus</hi> King of <hi>Armorica</hi> or
                  <hi>Little-Britain,</hi> to crave his aid against the
                  <hi>Scots</hi>
                  and <hi>Picts,</hi>
                  who then plagued
                  the <hi>Britains:</hi> 13 <hi>Vodius</hi> or
                  <hi>Vodinus,</hi> slain
                  by <hi>Hengist</hi> (but some say by
                  <hi>Vortiger</hi>)
                  at the first entrance of the <hi>Sateons</hi> into this
                  Isle: 14 And last of all, <hi>Theonus</hi> who
                  had
                  been
                  sometimes
                  Bishop of <hi>Gloncester,</hi> but
                  was
                  after translated
                  hither, and was
                  the last Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> of this line or
                  <hi>Series.</hi> Of some of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the
                  second, and the three last, there
                  is
                  good <hi>constat</hi> in Antiquity: whether there be the
                  like of all the residue, I am
                  not able to determine. So for the
                  Bishops
                  or Arch-bishops
                  of <hi>York,</hi> of the <hi>British</hi> line,
                  besides
                  <hi>Faganus</hi> the first Arch-bishop of this See, as
                  before was
                  said
                  and besides
                  <hi>Eborius</hi> formerly
                  remembred
                  amongst the Subscribers
                  to the Council of <hi>Arles:</hi>
                
                our Stories
                  tell us of one <hi>Sampson</hi>
                  said
                  to be made
                  the Bishop of the place in the time of
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <hi>Lucius;</hi>
                
                of one <hi>Pyramus</hi> preferred
                  unto this honour by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> whose
                  domestick
                  Chaplain he then was:
                  and finally
                  of <hi>Tadiacus,</hi> who together with <hi>Theonus</hi>
                  the last Bishop of <hi>London</hi> of this line or Race,
                  fled
                  into <hi>Wales,</hi>
                  the better to avoid the tyranny of the
                  <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                
                who then made
                  havock
                  of the Church. And for the Bishops
                  or Arch-bishops
                  of <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>Usk,</hi> which
                  was
                  the third <hi>Metropolitical</hi> City in the account
                  and estimate of those times,
                  we have assurance of <hi>Dubritius</hi> a right godly
                  man, ordained
                  Bishop of the same by <hi>Germanus</hi> and
                  <hi>Lupus,</hi> two <hi>French</hi>
                  Prelates,
                  at such time as they came
                  to <hi>Britain</hi> for the suppressing
                  of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie;
                  whose Successours
                  we have upon Record, under the Title of
                  <hi>Llandaffe</hi> to this very day. That
                  <hi>Gloucester</hi> also in those
                  times
                  was
                  a Bishops
                  See, besides
                  what did
                  appear before, is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Cambden,</hi>
                
                who tells
                  us that the Bishops
                  of the same occur in the subscriptions
                  to some ancient Councils,
                  under the name of <hi>Cluvienses;</hi> for by the name
                  of <hi>Clevum</hi> or <hi>Caer-Glowy</hi>
                  was
                  it called
                  of old. But not to wander into more
                  particulars,
                  either <hi>Sees</hi>
                  or <hi>Bishops:</hi>
                
                we find in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that in the Council of
                  <hi>Sardica</hi> holden
                  in <hi>Anno</hi> 358. some of the <hi>British</hi>
                  Bishops
                  were
                  assembled
                  amongst the rest, concurring
                  with them
                  in the condemnation of the <hi>Arian</hi>
                  Heresies.
                  As also, that in the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi>
                
                held
                  the next year after, the <hi>British</hi>
                  Bishops
                  were
                  there present: three of the which
                  were
                  so necessitous and poor, that they
                  were
                  fain to be maintained
                  at the publick
                  charge, <hi>Sanctius putantes fiscum gravare qum
                  singulos,</hi> thinking
                  it far more commendably
                  honest to be defraied
                  out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> than to be
                  burdensom
                  unto their Friends.
                  And when Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> sent
                  <hi>Austin</hi> hither for the conversion of the
                  <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                
                he found no fewer
                  than seven Bishops
                  in the <hi>British</hi> Churches,
                  <hi>viz. Herefordensis,
                  Tavensis, Paternensis, Banchorensis, Elwiensis,
                  Wiccensis,</hi> and <hi>Morganensis</hi> (or rather
                  <hi>Menevensis</hi>) as <hi>Balaeus</hi>
                  counts
                  them.
                
                All of which, that of <hi>Paternensis</hi>
                  excepted
                  only, do still remain amongst us under other
                  names.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now if I should be asked,
                
                whom
                  I conceive to have been
                  the Primate of the <hi>British</hi> Church during the
                  time it flourished,
                  and stood
                  upright, neither oppressed
                  by the tyranny
                  of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> nor in a sort
                  exterminated
                  by the <hi>Saxons</hi>
                  fury; I answer, that it is
                  most likely to be the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> or
                  Arch-bishop of <hi>York:</hi> And this I do upon these
                  reasons.
                
                For first, however it appears
                  by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that <hi>London</hi>
                  was
                  a Town of the greatest
                  Trade, <hi>copia negotiorum  commeatuum maxime
                  celebris,</hi> as that Author hath
                  it:
                
                yet neither was
                  it ever made
                  a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, nor made
                  the seat at any time of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperours.
                  But on the other side, <hi>York</hi>
                  was
                  a Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  even of long continuance, as appears
                  not only by the testimony of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>
                  and <hi>Antoninus;</hi>
                
                but by this ancient inscription
                  vouched
                  by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> and by
                  an
                  old Coin of <hi>Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperour,
                  bearing
                  this inscription, COL. EBORACUM
                  LEG. VI. VICTRIX. And as it was
                  a Colony of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, so
                  was
                  it also for a time the seat of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperours:
                  For here the Emperour
                  <hi>Severus</hi> before remembred,
                  yielded
                  up his Soul: and here <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi>
                  deceased
                  also,
                
                having
                  both kept
                  their seat there a good time before: here
                  <hi>Constantine</hi> the great advancer of the Faith and
                  Gospel,
                
                was
                  first brought
                  forth into the World; and here did
                  he first take upon him,
                  together with the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the
                  Government of that part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
                  which had
                  belonged
                  unto his Father. So that <hi>Eboracum</hi> or
                  <hi>York,</hi> being
                  the ancient seat of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Emperours,
                  what time they pleased
                  to be resident in the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi>
                  was
                  questionless the seat of their <hi>Vicarii</hi> or
                  Lieutenants
                  General, when they were
                  absent from the same: and so by consequence, the seat of
                  the <hi>British Primate,</hi> according
                  to the Rules
                  and Platform before laid
                  down. Add here that for the time the
                  <hi>Romans</hi>
                  held
                  this Island in their possession, they
                  setled
                  their <hi>Praetorium</hi>
                  for the administration of Justice, in the City of
                  <hi>York,</hi> drawing
                  thither the resort
                  of all the subjects
                  which had
                  any business of that kind, for dispatch thereof: in
                  which regard it is
                  called
                  by <hi>Spartianus</hi> ,
                
                the City, as by way of excellence. <hi>Veniens in
                  Civitatem, primm in templum</hi> Bellonae
                  <hi>ductus est,</hi> speaking
                  of the entrance which <hi>Severus</hi>
                  made
                  into the City of <hi>York.</hi> But that which most of
                  all confirms
                  me, is
                  the subscription of the <hi>British</hi>
                  Bishops
                  to the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> as it
                  is
                  published
                  amongst the <hi>Gallick</hi>
                  Councils
                  by <hi>Sirmundus,</hi> thus: <hi>Eborius, Episcopus de
                  Civitate Eboracensi,
                  Provincia Britannia. Restitutus Episcopus de civitate
                  Londinensi,
                  Provincia supradicta. Adelphius Episcopus de civitate
                  Colonia Londinensium; exinde Sacerdos
                  Presbyter,
                  Arminius Diaconus.</hi> By which subscription it
                  is
                  plain, that the Bishop or Archbishop
                  of <hi>York,</hi> having
                  place of <hi>London,</hi> was
                  Primate of the <hi>British</hi> Church: there
                  being
                  otherwise no reason why he should have precedence in the
                  Subscription. And so much for the
                  setling
                  of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in the Church of
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> at this reception of
                
                
                the Gospel from the See of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  being
                  the first time that the Faith of Christ
                  was
                  publickly
                  received
                  and countenanced;
                  not in this Island only, but any other part of the World
                  whatever. All which I have laid
                  down together, that I might keep my self the
                  closer
                  to my other businesses,
                  to which now I hasten.

                HAVING
                  thus setled
                  the affairs
                  of the Church of <hi>Britain,</hi>
                
                we will look back again towards
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> where we find <hi>Victor</hi>
                  sitting
                  as successor unto <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> and the whole
                  Church though free from persecutions,
                  yet terribly
                  embroyled
                  with Schisms
                  and Heresies.
                  For in the later
                  end of <hi>Eleutherius, Blastus</hi> and
                  <hi>Florinus</hi> two notorious
                  Hereticks
                  had
                  broached
                  this doctrine, ,
                
                that God was
                  the author of sin: and possibly
                  might have spread the venom of their
                  Heresie
                  exceeding
                  far, if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that great and
                  learned
                  Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> being
                  then at <hi>Rome,</hi> had
                  not prescribed
                  a speedy and a sovereign Antidote, in several
                  Tractates
                  and Discourses
                  against the same. But <hi>Eleutherius</hi>
                  being
                  dead, and <hi>Victor</hi> in his place, there
                  hapned
                  such a Schism in the Church of Christ, by his
                  precipitance and perversness,
                  that all the water, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and many
                  other godly men
                  could pour into it,
                
                was
                  hardly
                  sufficient
                  to quench the flame. The business which
                  occasioned
                  it, was
                  the feast of <hi>Easter:</hi> or indeed not the Feast it
                  self, upon the keeping
                  of the which all Christians
                  had
                  agreed
                  from the first beginnings:
                  but for the day in which it was
                  to be observed,
                  wherein the Churches
                  of <hi>Asia</hi> had
                  an
                  old Tradition, differing
                  from the rest of Christendom.
                  For whereas generally
                  that festival had
                  been
                  solemnized
                  in the Church of Christ, on the
                  <hi>Lords
                  Day</hi> next after the <hi>Jewish</hi>
                  Passeover,
                  as being
                  the day which our Redeemer honoured
                  with his Resurrection: the Christians
                  of the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches
                  kept
                  it, upon the 14th day of the month
                  precisely,
                  being
                  the very day prescribed
                  for the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passeover.
                  A business of no great importance, more than for a
                  general conformity
                  in the Church of Christ; yet such as long
                  had
                  exercised
                  the patience of it, even from the time of <hi>Pius</hi>
                  Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who first
                  decreed
                  it to be kept
                  on the Lords
                  Day, <hi>Die Dominico Pascha celebrari,</hi> as it
                  is
                  in <hi>Platina;</hi>
                
                but followed
                  with most heat and violence by this <hi>Victor,</hi>
                  perhaps upon the <hi>Omen</hi> of his name. Of
                  whom
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> thus reporteth,
                  , c. that he
                  attempted
                  to cut off the whole Church of <hi>Asia,</hi> together
                  with the Churches
                  adjacent, from the Communion of the
                  Catholick,
                  , as if they
                  had
                  maintained
                  some heterodox or dangerous Doctrine contrary to the
                  Faith of Christ. A matter taken
                  very tenderly
                  not only by the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops
                  whom
                  it most concerned,
                  but also by some other of the <hi>Western</hi>
                  parts,
                  who more endeavoured
                  the preservation of the Churches
                  peace, than the advancement
                  and authority of the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> those of
                  chief note which interessed
                
                
                
                themselves therein, being
                  <hi>Irenaeus, Polycrates:</hi> the one Bishop of the
                  <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> in
                  <hi>France;</hi> the other of the Church of
                  <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Asia;</hi> both
                  honourable
                  in their times

                  the occasion and descent of their observation,
                
                from <hi>Philip</hi> ,
                
                one of the twelve Apostles
                  (not of the seven Deacons,

                  ridiculously
                  and falsly

                  at <hi>Hierapolis</hi> a City of <hi>Phrygia;</hi> and
                  from Saint <hi>John</hi> , who
                  rested
                  on the bosom of our Lord and Saviour; as also from
                  <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and <hi>Thracias,</hi>
                  Bishops
                  of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and both Martyrs;

                  the feast of <hi>Easter</hi> as the <hi>Asians</hi>
                  did.
                  As for himself, he certifieth,
                  that following
                  the Traditions
                  of his Elders
                  he had
                  done
                  the like; that seven of his kindred
                  had
                  been
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  , himself being

                  and all which did

                  <hi>Jews</hi>
                  did
                  prepare the Passeover;
                  that having

                  over the holy Scriptures,
                  and held
                  both intercourse and correspondence with many of the
                  brethren over all the World, , he
                  was
                  the least disturbed
                  at those <hi>Bruta fulmina.</hi>
                  Adding
                  withal, that he might here commemorate those several
                  Bishops
                  that were
                  assembled

                  but that this bare retital of their
                  names
                  was
                  too great a trouble: who though they could not but be
                  sensible of his imperfections,
                  yet thinking
                  that he bare not those gray hairs
                  for nought, did
                  willingly
                  subscribe unto his Epistle. So far,
                
                and to this purpose he. And on the other side,
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writing
                  unto <hi>Victor</hi> utterly
                  dislikes
                  that his severe and rigid manner of
                  proceeding,
                  in cutting
                  off so many Churches
                  from the Communion of our Lord, ,
                  only because they did
                  adhere to the Tradition of their
                  Ancestors
                  in a point of Ceremony:
                  shewing
                  how much he differed
                  in this business from the temper and moderation of his
                  Predecessours,
                  <hi>Soter, Anicetus, Pius, Higinus, Sixtus</hi> and
                  <hi>Telesphorus,</hi> who though they
                  held
                  the same opinions
                  that he did,
                  did
                  notwithstanding entertain the <hi>Asian</hi>
                  Bishops,
                  when they came
                  unto them,
                  with great affection and humanity;
                  sending
                  to those who lived
                  far distant, the most blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in testimony of their
                  fellowship
                  and Communion with them.
                  Nor did
                  he write thus unto <hi>Victor</hi> only,
                  , but to the
                  Governours
                  or Bishops
                  of many other Churches
                  also. And certainly
                  it was
                  but need that such a Moderator should be
                  raised
                  to atone the difference: the billows
                  beating
                  very highly,
                  and <hi>Victor</hi> being
                  beset on every side for his stiff
                  perversness,
                  by the Prelates
                  of the adverse party, ,
                  sharply
                  assaulting
                  him
                  both with words
                  and Writings.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the composing
                  of this business,
                
                before it grew
                  to such a heat, there could no better
                  means
                  be thought of, than that the Bishops
                  of the Church in their several quarters
                  should meet together to debate and determine of it. And
                  so accordingly
                  they did,
                
                , and many Synods
                  and assemblies
                  of the Bishops,
                  were
                  held
                  about it: <hi>viz.</hi> one in <hi>Caesarea</hi> of
                  <hi>Palestine,</hi> wherein <hi>Theophilus</hi> B. of
                  the place, and <hi>Narcissus</hi> B. of
                  <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  did
                  sit as Presidents:
                  another at <hi>Rome:</hi> a third of all the
                  Bishops
                  of <hi>Pontus,</hi> in the which <hi>Palmas,</hi>
                  , as the chief amongst
                  them
                  of that Order, did
                  then preside: A fourth there was
                  of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Gallick</hi>
                  Churches,
                  in the which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sat as chief: a fifth of
                  all the Churches
                  about <hi>Osroena</hi> and the parts
                  adjoyning.
                  <hi>Bachyllus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  , and many other
                  Bishops
                  of particular Churches,
                  held
                  their Synod also apart and separate; which all with one
                  consent determined,
                  that the feast of <hi>Easter</hi>
                  was
                  to be observed
                  on no other day than that upon the which our
                  Saviour
                  rose: contrary to the usage of the <hi>Asian</hi>
                  Churches.
                  In agitation of which business,
                  I observe these things.
                  First, that Episcopacy in so short a time
                  was
                  setled
                  and confirmed
                  over all the World, or so much of it at the least, as
                  had
                  received
                  the Faith and Gospel. Secondly,
                  that on all emergent Controversies,
                  that did
                  engage the Church of Christ, the
                  Bishops,
                  as men
                  most concerned
                  in the Churches
                  Peace, were
                  still most forward also to compose the same.
                  Thirdly,
                  that on the practices
                  of the Popes
                  of <hi>Rome</hi> to enlarge their border, the
                  Bishops
                  of the Church of what part soever,
                  have always
                  been
                  most ready to oppose the same; and keep that proud and
                  swelling
                  See within the compass of its
                  proper and peculiar bounds.
                  So far were
                  those most godly and Religious men,
                
                from <hi>making
                  a stirrup for Antichrist to get into his Saddle,</hi>
                  though some have so given
                  out in these later
                  days
                  to the dishonour of those glorious
                
                
                lights
                  in the House of Christ, and the profane reproach not
                  only of the wisdom of that Church, but also of the Holy
                  Spirit of Almighty God. Fourthly,
                  That on the rising
                  of such differences,
                  as did
                  disturb the Churches
                  Peace, the Bishops
                  of the Church have an
                  innate and proper power,
                
                of convocating
                  and assembling
                  Councils
                  both National
                  and Provincial for the appeasing
                  of the same; wherein the greatest
                  Champions
                  of the Popedom, do consent also: Which Power as they
                  made
                  use of, as their own peculiar, when as there
                  were
                  no Christian Princes
                  to have a care unto the main: so since there have
                  been
                  Christian Princes,
                  that Power is
                  not extinguished
                  but directed
                  only. Fifthly,
                  that in those Councils
                  or Synodical meetings,
                  the Bishops
                  and their Clergy had
                  authority both to debate and to determine of all such
                  matters,
                  as did
                  concern the Church of Christ, either in point of Faith
                  or Ceremony; not seeking
                  any confirmation of their Acts
                  and Ordinances,
                  from that Christian People, who
                  were
                  to yield obedience to them.
                  And last of all, that such things
                  as by them
                  were
                  then determined,
                  did
                  presently
                  oblige all people under the governance and direction of
                  the said
                  Prelates
                  and Clergy, so met
                  together and assembled,
                  as before is
                  said;
                  as appears
                  partly by that calm which followed
                  over all the Church, upon the holding
                  of these Synods;
                  but principally
                  by that end, which afterwards
                  was
                  put unto this Controversie,
                  by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                But to proceed with <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that Religious
                  Prelate,
                
                from what he did
                  as Bishop in the Churches
                  service, for the atoning
                  of her differences
                  and the advancement of her peace; to that which he
                  hath
                  left behind him
                  concerning
                  Bishops,
                  as a learned
                  Writer, the
                  light and glory of this Age. Which evidence of his,
                  because it doth relate to the Episcopal succession in
                  the Church of Christ, as a foundation on the which he
                  doth build his structures;
                  we will first look on the Succession of the four prime
                  Sees,
                  by which we may conjecture at the state and quality of
                  all the rest. And this we cannot
                  do at a better time, than where now we are, the time
                  when <hi>Victor</hi> sat in the Chair of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  which being
                  in the close of the present Century,
                  gives
                  us opportunity, to look as well upon his
                  Predecessors,
                  as his and their Cotemporaries
                  in the same. And first for <hi>Rome,</hi> from
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> where we first
                  began,
                
                to <hi>Victor</hi> which is
                  now the subject of our History, we find the
                  names
                  and actions
                  of nine intermediate Bishops:
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> being
                  the fourth, and <hi>Victor</hi> the 14th, in that
                  Catalogue; most of the which had
                  suffered
                  death for the sake of Christ, whose honour they
                  preferred
                  before worldly glories.
                  For <hi>Antioch</hi> next, I find that from
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> who began
                  this Century, unto <hi>Serapion</hi> who sat Bishop
                  there in the conclusion of the same,
                  were
                  five Bishops
                  only: and that in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from
                  <hi>Cerdo</hi> to <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  inclusively,
                  were
                  no more than seven. By which it
                  is
                  most clear and evident that the
                  Bishops
                  in neither of these Churches,
                  held
                  the Chair by turns
                  from week to week, or from month to month as some
                  men
                  suppose,
                
                but were
                  invested
                  with a constant and fixt
                  preheminence,
                  such as the Bishops
                  now enjoy in the Church of Christ: some of
                  them,
                  in the two last specially,
                  holding
                  out ten years,
                  some twenty, others more than that; as by the
                  Tables
                  of <hi>Succession</hi> published
                  by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> doth at full appear. As for
                  <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  the Bishops
                  thereof indeed held
                  not out so long, there being
                  no fewer
                  than thirteen from <hi>Simeon</hi> unto <hi>Marcus</hi>
                  the first Bishop of that Church, which
                  was
                  not of the <hi>Circumcision;</hi> and
                  thirteen
                  more betwixt this <hi>Marcus</hi> and
                  <hi>Narcissus,</hi> who closed
                  this Century. So that within one hundred
                  years
                  there sat nine and twenty Bishops
                  in this Church: which sheweth,
                  as <hi>Baronius</hi> well observeth,
                
                <hi>Ecclesiam Hyerosolymitanam dira fuisse
                  persecutione
                  vexatam,</hi> that this poor Church
                  was
                  terribly
                  afflicted
                  with persecutions.
                  And so it is
                  most like to be: For standing
                  as it did
                  betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and
                  equally
                  hated
                  of them
                  both; how could it chuse
                  but suffer under a double tyranny; each of the
                  adversaries
                  striving
                  who should most afflict her? Nor
                  hath
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> only given
                  a bare and naked list of names,
                  but calculated
                  punctually
                  and precisely,
                  the time and years,
                  in which all the Bishops
                  of the three first Sees
                  did
                  possess the Government of those
                  Churches,
                  which he professeth
                  that he could not find in the last
                  exactly,
                  by reason of the shortness of their
                  lives,
                  ,
                
                as his words
                  there are. But what we fail of there, we find
                  performed
                  after by <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> who
                  hath
                  assigned
                  to every one of them
                  his own term and time: in the which
                  whether he
                  be rather censured
                  than rectified
                  by <hi>Petavius,</hi>
                
                I mean not to examine in this place and time. For
                  howsoever at the first <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  was
                  not reckoned
                  for a Patriarchal
                  Church, as the others were:
                  yet in regard of the opinion which
                  was
                  held
                  of the place it self, as being
                  honoured
                  with the Passion of our Lord and Saviour, and with the
                  Preaching
                  of the Holy Hpostles, and consequently
                  reckoned
                  for the Mother-City of
                
                
                
                the Christian Church; the Bishops
                  of that Church were
                  in great esteem, and the Episcopal succession there
                  preserved
                  on exact record, as in the three great Patriarchal
                  Sees
                  before remembred.
              </p>
              <p>
                But here I meet with an
                  Objection that must first be answered,
                
                before we see what use is
                  made
                  of this Episcopal succession by the ancient
                  writers.
                  For if that those who thus succeeded
                  one another in these several Churches,
                  were
                  no more than Presbyters,
                  as some please to say, then must we quit the cause, and
                  let fall the action. And though I cannot think that
                  men
                  of wit and learning,
                  whatsoever they say, doe or can
                  possibly
                  conceive them
                  to be other than Bishops,
                  Bishops
                  distinct from Presbyters,
                  both in power and title; yet we are
                  told,
                  and we shall see how truly,
                  that <hi>Anicetus, Pius, Higinus,</hi>
                
                <hi>Telesphorus,</hi> and <hi>Sextus,</hi>
                  whom
                  the Papists
                  call Bishops,
                  and the Popes
                  Predecessors,
                  are by <hi>Eusebius</hi> termed
                  Presbyters;
                  and therefore (for what else must be the inference?)
                  that <hi>Bishops
                  and Presbyters
                  are the same.</hi> A passage in the which there are
                  almost as many fallacies
                  and mistakes,
                  as words;
                  which I shall briefly
                  represent, and so pass them
                  by. For first, <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                  whom
                  they cite, doth not call them
                  Presbyters,
                  but <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                
                which so great Criticks
                  should have seen.
                  The difference of the Age or time when these
                  Authors
                  lived,
                  maketh
                  a great difference in the use and acceptation of the
                  word: And I believe it cannot easily
                  be found, whatever may be said
                  of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that Bishops
                  are called
                  Presbyters
                  by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> or any Writer of his time. 2. It
                  is
                  not evident by the Authors
                  words,
                  that  is
                  there used
                  to denote the Office, but the Age or rather Seniority of
                  those holy men
                  which preceded
                  Victor in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Or if it
                  were,
                  yet 3ly. it is
                  past all question, that simply
                  Presbyters
                  they were
                  not, though by him
                  so called,
                  but , such as
                  had
                  had
                  the government of that famous Church, and so
                  were
                  Bishops
                  at the least both in name and office. 4. The
                  calling
                  of them
                  by the name of Presbyters
                  doth no more conclude that Presbyters
                  and Bishops
                  were
                  the same, than if a man discoursing
                  of the state of <hi>London,</hi> should say that my
                  <hi>Lord Mayor was
                  a wealthy Citizen;</hi> and thereupon a stander by
                  should make this conclusion, that every Citizen
                  is
                  <hi>Lord Mayor of London,</hi> and
                  hath
                  as much to do in the Government thereof, as he. 5. The
                  Papists
                  do not call <hi>Higinus, Pius, Sixtus,</hi> and the rest
                  there mentioned
                  by the name of Bishops;
                  or if they do, they do not call
                  them
                  so <hi>qu</hi> Papists;
                  or if so too, and that none call
                  them
                  so but Papists,
                  there is
                  almost no Father in the Church of Christ who may not
                  presently
                  be endited
                  and condemned
                  of Popery, because there is
                  almost no Father, nor any other ancient Writer who doth
                  not call them
                  by that name. 6. And lastly,
                  it is
                  no Popery, nor the language of a Papist neither, to say
                  that <hi>Pius, Sixtus,</hi> and the rest there
                  named,
                  were
                  the Popes
                  Predecessors;
                  for Predecessors
                  of the Popes
                  they were
                  in their See and Government, though neither in their
                  Tyranny nor Superstition.
                  Nor doth this Argument strike only at the
                  Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they only
                  named,
                  but at all the Bishops
                  of the Primitive Church, whether of the
                  greater
                  Patriarchal
                  Sees,
                  or of any other; who, if the observation of these
                  men
                  be good and valid, were
                  no more but Presbyters.
                  The best way to refel which fancy,
                  is
                  to behold the latitude
                  and extent of that jurisdiction which the
                  Bishops
                  of these Churches
                  did
                  enjoy at this present time; which when we have
                  laid
                  down sincerely,
                  according
                  as it stood
                  in the times
                  we speak of, it shall be left to be
                  considered
                  of by any sober-minded
                  man, whosoever he be, whether the
                  men
                  that held
                  such ample jurisdiction were
                  no more than Presbyters,
                  or whether such Bishops
                  were
                  the same with Presbyters,
                  which comes
                  both to one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that the latitude of jurisdiction
                  belonging
                  to these four prime Sees,
                
                especially
                  to those of <hi>Antioch, Rome,</hi> and
                  <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was
                  as ancient as the times
                  whereof we speak, appeareth
                  plainly
                  by the Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. For whereas
                  it was
                  ordered
                  by the aforesaid Council,
                
                , that ancient
                  customs
                  should prevail, <hi>viz.</hi> the
                  Churches
                  of <hi>Alexandria, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi>
                  should enjoy those priviledges
                  which before they had;
                  those priviledges
                  or customs,
                  call them
                  which you will; could not of right be
                  counted
                  ancient, unless we place them
                  at the latest
                  in this second Century, the close thereof
                  being
                  not much above an
                  hundred years
                  before that Synod. Now for those
                  priviledges
                  what they were,
                  we are in part informed
                  by the self same Cannon;
                
                where it is
                  said,
                  that the jurisdiction of the Bishop of
                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> did
                  extend over all <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                
                <hi>Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis:</hi> To which though
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> addeth
                  <hi>Thebais Maraeotica,</hi> and <hi>Ammoniaca,</hi> yet
                  he adds
                  nothing in effect; the two first
                  being
                  Provinces
                  of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the last of <hi>Libya:</hi> So
                  that his jurisdiction reached
                  from <hi>Gaza</hi> in the parts
                  of <hi>Syria,</hi> unto the Western border of
                  <hi>Cyrenaica,</hi> (for that was
                  the <hi>Pentapolis</hi>
                
                
                mentioned
                  in the Canon) where it conterminated on that of
                  <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  The <hi>Canon</hi> having
                  thus laid
                  out the bounds
                  of the command and jurisdiction
                  belonging
                  unto him
                  of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> proceedeth
                  unto that of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
                  had
                  his <hi>mos parilis,</hi> or ,
                  an
                  answerable latitude and extent of power. But for the
                  certainty of this extent
                  we must refer our selves
                  unto <hi>Ignatius,</hi> directing
                  his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                
                with this superscription, , to the
                  sanctified
                  and illuminated
                  Church of God, presiding
                  in the place of the Religion of the
                  <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can out of this extract
                  an
                  Argument for the Popes
                  supremacy,
                
                as he pretendeth
                  to have done,
                  he is
                  a better Chymist
                  than I took
                  him
                  for. And therefore I must turn him
                  over to be better tutored
                  by <hi>Vedelius,</hi> who howsoever in his
                  notes
                  upon that Father, he lean too much on his own
                  affections
                  and opinions,
                  doth in this very well declare the good
                  Fathers
                  meaning,
                  agreeably
                  unto the tendries of antiquity. And by
                  him
                  we are told,
                
                that nothing here is
                  meant
                  by the place or Religion of the
                  <hi>Romans,
                  nisi quicquid in Italia terrarum Praefecti urbis
                  administrationi suberat;</hi>
                  but only those parts
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> which were
                  directly
                  under the civil government of the Provost of
                  <hi>Rome;</hi> that is
                  to say, <hi>Latium, Tuscia,</hi> and <hi>Picenum:</hi>
                  To which perhaps were
                  added
                  in the following
                  Ages
                  the whole East part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which we now call
                  <hi>Naple_</hi>
                  _ogether
                  with the Isles of <hi>Corsica, Sardinia,</hi> and
                  <hi>Sicilia,</hi> all which made
                  up the proper <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of the Bishop of
                  <hi>Rome.</hi> In which regard, as
                  anciently
                  the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
                  called
                  <hi>Urbicus,</hi> as doth appear
                  plainly
                  by <hi>Optatus,</hi>
                
                calling
                  Pope <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> by the name of <hi>Zephyrinus
                  Urbicus,</hi> the City-Bishop: So the
                  said
                  Provinces
                  or Regions
                  unto him
                  belonging,
                  were
                  called
                  by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> an
                  <hi>Italian</hi> writer, <hi>Suburbicariae
                  Regiones,</hi> or the City Provinces.
                  As for the Church of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> it spread
                  its
                  bounds
                  and jurisdiction
                  over those goodly Countries
                  of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, from the
                  <hi>Mediterranean</hi> on the West, unto the
                  furthest
                  border of that large dominion, where it
                  confined
                  upon the <hi>Persian,</hi> or the <hi>Parthian</hi>
                  Kingdom, together with <hi>Cilicia</hi> and
                  <hi>Isauria</hi> in the lesser <hi>Asia:</hi> But
                  whether at this time it was
                  so extended,
                  I am
                  not able to determine. Certain
                  I am,
                  that in the very first beginning
                  of this Age, all <hi>Syria</hi> at the least
                  was
                  under the jurisdiction of this Bishop:
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in his said
                  Epistle to those of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                stiling
                  himself , (not a Bishop in
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> but) the Bishop of <hi>Syria;</hi> which
                  sheweth,
                  that there being
                  many Bishops
                  in that large Province, he had
                  a power and superiority
                  over all the rest. Indeed the Bishops
                  of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  were
                  hedged
                  within a narrower
                  compass being
                  both now and long time after subject unto the
                  <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> as
                  appears
                  plainly
                  by the <hi>Nicene Canon;</hi> though after they
                  enlarged
                  their border,
                  and gained
                  the title of a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> as we may see
                  hereafter in convenient time. Only I add, that howsoever
                  other of the greater
                  Metropolitan Churches,
                  such as were
                  absolute and independent, as <hi>Carthage, Cyprus,
                  Millain,</hi>
                  the Church of <hi>Britain,</hi>
                
                and the rest, had
                  and enjoyed
                  all manner of <hi>Patriarchal</hi>
                  rights
                  which these three enjoyed;
                  yet only the three Bishops
                  of <hi>Rome, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  had
                  in the Primitive times
                  the names
                  of <hi>Patriarches,</hi>
                  by reason of the greatness of the
                  Cities
                  themselves, being
                  the principal both for power and
                  riches
                  in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the one for
                  <hi>Europe,</hi> the other for <hi>Asia,</hi> and the
                  third for <hi>Africk.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                This ground thus laid,
                
                we will behold what use is
                  made
                  of this Episcopal succession by the ancient
                  writers.
                  And first Saint <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> a Bishop and a Martyr
                  both, derives
                  an
                  argument from hence to convince those
                  <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
                  which broached
                  strange Doctrines
                  in the Church.
                
                <hi>Habemus annumerari eos qui ab Apostolis instituti
                  sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis,</hi>
                  c. we are able to produce those
                  men
                  which were
                  ordained
                  Bishops
                  by the Apostles
                  in their several Churches,
                  and their successors
                  till our times;
                  <hi>qui nihil tale docuerunt neque cognoverunt, quale ab
                  hiis deliratur,</hi> who neither
                  knew
                  nor taught
                  any such absurdities
                  as these men
                  dream of. Which said
                  in general, he instanceth
                  in the particular Churches
                  of <hi>Rome, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                  being
                  all founded
                  by the Apostles;
                  and all of them,
                  <hi>hac ordinatione
                   successione,</hi>
                  by this Episcopal ordination and succession,
                  deriving
                  from the Apostles
                  the Preaching
                  and tradition of Gods
                  holy truth till those very times.
                  The like we find also in another place, where
                  speaking
                  of those <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> (so he
                  calleth
                  the Bishops)
                  which claimed
                  a succession from the Apostles:
                  He tells
                  us this, <hi>quod cum Episcopatus
                  successione
                  charisma veritatis certum, secundum placitum Patris
                  acceperunt;</hi> that together with the Episcopal
                  succession,
                
                they had
                  received
                  a certain pledge of truth, according
                  to the good pleasure of the Father. See to this purpose
                  also <hi>cap.</hi> 63. where the same point
                  is
                  pressed
                  most fully,
                  and indeed much unto the honour of this Episcopal
                  succession. Where because <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                  called
                  Bishops
                  in the former
                  place by the name of Presbyters,
                  I would have no man gather,
                
                as some men
                  have
                
                
                
                done,
                  that he doth use the name of Bishops
                  and Presbyters,
                   in a promiscuous
                  sense; much less conclude, that therefore
                  Presbyters
                  and Bishops
                  were
                  then the same. For although <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth here
                  call the Bishops,
                  either by reason of their age, or of that common
                  Ordination which they once received
                  by the name of Presbyters,
                  yet he doth no where call the Presbyters
                  by the name of Bishops;
                  as he must needs
                  have done,
                  if he did
                  use the names
                   in a promiscuous sense, as it
                  is
                  supposed.
                  And besides,
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> being
                  at this time Bishop, if not Archbishop of the Church of
                  <hi>Lyons,</hi> could not but know that he
                  was
                  otherwise advanced
                  both in power and title, as well in Dignity as
                  Jurisdiction, than when he was
                  a Presbyter of that very Church, under <hi>Pothinus</hi>
                  his Predecessor in that See; and therefore not the same
                  man meerly
                  which he was
                  before. But to let pass as well the observation as the
                  inference,
                  certain I am
                  that by this argument the holy Father
                  did
                  conceive himself to be armed
                  sufficiently
                  against the Hereticks
                  of his time, and so much he expresseth
                  plainly,
                  saying,
                  that by this weapon he was
                  able to confound all those, <hi>qui quoquo modo vel per
                  sui placentiam malam, vel vanam gloriam, vel per
                  coecitatem  malam sententiam, praeter quam
                  oportet,</hi>
                
                <hi>colligunt:</hi> Who any way, either out of
                  an
                  evil self- complacency, or vainglorious
                  humour, or blindness of the mind, or a
                  depraved
                  understanding,
                  did
                  raise such Doctrins
                  as they ought not. So much for blessed
                  <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> a man of peace as well in disposition
                  and affection, as he was
                  in name.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next let us look upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                
                who lived
                  in the same time with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                  beginning
                  first to be of credit about the latter end of this
                  second <hi>Century,</hi>
                
                as <hi>Baronius</hi> calculates
                  it; and being
                  at the height of reputation, <hi>an.</hi>
                  210. as <hi>Pamelius</hi> noteth,
                  about which time Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                  suffered
                  Martyrdom. And if we look upon him
                  well, we find him
                  pressing
                  the same point with greater
                  efficacy than <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                  did
                  before him.
                  For undertaking
                  to convince the Hereticks
                  of his time, as well of falshood
                  as of novelties,
                  and to make known
                  the new upstartedness of their Assemblies
                  (which they called
                  the Church) he doth thus proceed.
                
                <hi>Edant ergo origines ecclesiarum suarum, evolvant
                  ordinem Episcoporum suorum,</hi> c.
                <q>Let them,
                  saith
                  he, declare the original of their

                  let them
                  unfold the course or order of their
                  Bishops,
                  succeeding
                  so to one another from the first
                  beginning,
                  that their first Bishop (whosoever he
                  was)
                  had
                  some of the Apostles,
                  or of the Apostolical men
                  at least, who did
                  converse with the Apostles
                  to be their founder and Predecessor. For thus the
                  Apostolical Churches
                  do derive their Pedegree.
                  Thus doth the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi>
                  shew
                  their <hi>Polycarpus</hi> placed
                  there amongst them
                  by Saint <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> her
                  <hi>Clement</hi> Consecrated
                  or Ordained
                  by <hi>Peter:</hi> even as all other
                  Churches
                  also do exhibit to us the names
                  of those, who being
                  Ordained
                  Bishops
                  by the Apostles,
                  did
                  sow the Apostolical seed in the field of God.</q>
                This was
                  the challenge that he made:
                  And this he had
                  not done
                  assuredly,
                  had
                  he not thought that the Episcopal succession in the
                  Church of Christ, had
                  been
                  an
                  evident demonstration of the truth thereof: which since
                  the Hereticks
                  could not shew
                  in their Congregations
                  or Assemblies,
                  it was
                  a very pregnant evidence, that they
                  had
                  neither verity nor antiquity to defend their
                  Doctrins;
                  nor could with any shew
                  of Justice challenge to themselves the name and honour
                  of a Church.
                
                And such, and none but such were
                  those other Churches
                  which he after speaketh
                  of, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Philippi,
                  Thessalonica, Ephesus,</hi> and the rest
                  planted
                  by the Apostles,
                  <hi>apud quas ipsae Cathedrae
                  Apostolorum suis locis praesidentur;</hi> in which the
                  Chairs
                  of the Apostles
                  to that time were
                  sate in, being
                  possessed,
                  not by themselves, but by their
                  Successors.
                  By the same argument <hi>Optatus</hi> first, and after
                  him
                  St. <hi>Austin</hi> did
                  confound the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
                  that mighty faction in the Church. St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  thus: <hi>Numerate Sacerdotes vel ab ipsa
                  sede</hi>
                  Petri,
                
                <hi> in illo ordine quis cui successerit
                  videte.</hi> Number the Bishops
                  which have sate but in <hi>Peters</hi>
                  Chair, and mark who have succeeded
                  one another in the same. A Catalogue
                  of which he gives
                  us in another place,
                
                lest else he might be thought to prescribe that to
                  others, on which he would not trust himself. Nay so far
                  he relyed
                  on the authority
                  of this Episcopal Succession in the Church of Christ, as
                  that he makes
                  it one of the special motives,
                  <hi>quae eum in gremio Ecclesiae justissim
                  teneant,</hi> which did
                  continue him
                  in the bosom of the Catholick
                  Church.
                
                As for <hi>Optatus,</hi> having
                  laid
                  down a Catalogue of the Bishops
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till his own
                  times:
                  He makes
                  a challenge to the <hi>Donatists</hi>
                  to present the like,
                
                <hi>Vestrae Cathedrae originem edite;</hi>
                  shew
                  us, saith
                  he, the first original of your Bishops,
                  and then you have done
                  somewhat to advance your cause: In which it
                  is
                  to be observed,
                  that though the instance be made
                  only in the Episcopal succession of the Church of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                the argument holds
                  good in all others also; it being
                  too troublesome a labour, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> well
                  observed,
                  <hi>omnium Ecclesiarum enumerare
                
                
                successiones,</hi> to run through the succession of all
                  particular Churches;
                  and therefore that made
                  choyce
                  of, as the chief or principal.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to return again unto <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                
                whom
                  I account amongst the Writers
                  of this Age, though he lived
                  partly in the other; besides
                  the use he made
                  of this Episcopal succession to convince the
                  Heretick,
                  he shews
                  us also what authority the Bishops
                  of the Church did
                  severally
                  enjoy and exercise in their successions,
                  which we will take according
                  to the proper and most natural course of Christianity.
                  First for the Sacrament of Baptism, which
                  is
                  the door or entrance into the Church,
                
                <hi>Dandi quidem jus habet summus sacerdos,</hi> i. e.
                  <hi>Episcopus.</hi> The Right, saith
                  he, of giving
                  <hi>Baptism</hi> hath
                  the High-Priest, which is
                  the Bishop, and then the Presbyters
                  and Deacons;
                  <hi>non tamen sine Episcopi antoritate,</hi>
                  yet not without the Bishops
                  licence and authority, for the Churches
                  honour; which if it be preserved,
                  then is
                  Peace maintained.
                  Nay so far he appropriates
                  it unto the
                  Bishop, as that he calleth
                  it <hi>dictatum Episcopi, officium Episcopatus,</hi> a
                  work most proper to the Bishop, in regard of his
                  Episcopacy, or particular Office: Which
                  howsoever
                  it may seem to ascribe too much unto the Bishop in the
                  administration of this Sacrament,
                  is
                  no more verily
                  than what was
                  after affirmed
                  by <hi>Hierom,</hi>
                
                shewing
                  that in his time <hi>sine Episcopi
                  jussione,</hi>
                  without the warrant of the Bishop, neither the
                  Presbyters
                  nor the Deacons
                  had
                  any authority to <hi>Baptize:</hi>
                  not that I think, that in the days
                  of <hi>Hierom,</hi> before whose time
                  Parishes
                  were
                  assigned
                  to Presbyters
                  throughout the Church, the Bishops
                  special consent and warrant was
                  requisite to the baptizing
                  of each several Infant; but that the
                  Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  did
                  receive from him
                  some general faculty, for their
                  enabling
                  in and to those Ministrations.
                  Next for the Sacrament of the blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that which is
                  a chief part of that heavenly nourishment
                  by which a Christian is
                  brought
                  up in the assured
                  hopes
                  of Eternal life. he tells
                  us in another place, <hi>non de aliorum manu quam
                  Praesidentium sumimus,</hi>
                
                that they received
                  it only from their Bishops
                  hand; the  or President of the
                  Presbytery,
                  as <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> seconded
                  by <hi>Beza,</hi> did
                  before call him.
                  Which Exposition or construction lest it should be
                  quarrelled
                  as being
                  injurious to the Presbyters,
                  who are thereby excluded
                  from the honour and name of Presidents:
                  I shall desire the Reader to consult those other
                  places
                  of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in which the word
                  <hi>Prefident</hi> is
                  used,
                  as <hi>viz.</hi>
                
                <hi>lib. ad uxorem,</hi> and <hi>lib. de Monogamia,</hi>
                  in both of which the man that had
                  a second Wife is
                  said
                  to be disabled
                  from Presiding
                  in the Church of God; and on consideration
                  to determine of it, whether it be more probable that
                  Presbyters
                  or Bishops
                  be here meant
                  by <hi>Presidents.</hi>
                  Besides
                  the Church not being
                  yet divided
                  generally
                  into Parishes,
                  but only in some greater
                  Cities,
                  the Presbyter had
                  not got
                  the stile of <hi>Rector,</hi> and therefore much less
                  might be called
                  a President, that being
                  a word of Power and Government, which at that time the
                  Presbyters
                  enjoyed
                  not in the Congregation. And here Pope <hi>Leo</hi> will
                  come in to help us, if occasion be,
                  assuring
                  us that in his time it was
                  not lawful for the Presbyter in the
                  Bishops
                  presence, <hi>nisi illo jubente,</hi>
                
                unless it were
                  by his appointment, <hi>conficere Sacramentum corporis
                   sanguinis Christi,</hi> to
                  consecrate
                  the Sacrament of Christs body and blood. The author of
                  the Tract ascribed
                  to <hi>Hierom,</hi> entituled
                  <hi>de Septem Ecclesiae ordinibus,</hi> doth affirm as
                  much: but being
                  the author of it is
                  uncertain, though it be placed
                  by <hi>Erasinus</hi> amongst the 
                  <hi>docta,</hi> we will pass it by.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the Administration of the Sacraments,
                
                which do belong <hi>ad potestatem
                  ordinis,</hi>
                  to the power of Order; proceed we on to those which do
                  appertain <hi>ad potestatem jurisdictionis,</hi> unto
                  the power of Jurisdiction. And the first thing we meet
                  with, is
                  the appointing
                  of the publick
                  Fasts,
                  used
                  often in the Church, as occasion
                  was.
                  A priviledg
                  not granted
                  to the common Presbyter, and much less to the common
                  people; but in those times,
                  wherein the Supream
                  Magistrate was
                  not within the pale or bosom
                  of the Church, entrusted
                  to the Bishop only. This noted
                  also by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his book
                  entituled
                  <hi>de jejuniis;</hi> which though he writ after his
                  falling
                  from the Church, and so not to be
                  trusted
                  in a point of Doctrine, may very well be
                  credited
                  in a point of custom: <hi>Quod  Episcopi universae
                  plebi mandare jejunia assolent, non dico de industria
                  stipium conferendarum, sed ex aliqua sollicitudinis
                  Ecclesiae causa;</hi>
                
                That Bishops
                  use to impose Fasts
                  upon the people, is
                  not done
                  of purpose for lucre, or the Alms
                  then given,
                  but out of a regard of the Churches
                  welfare or the sollicitousness
                  which they have thereof. Wherein as he
                  removes
                  a cavil, which as it seems
                  was
                  cast upon the Church, about the
                  <hi>calling</hi>
                  of those <hi>Fasts:</hi>
                  so, plainly
                  he ascribes
                  the <hi>calling</hi>
                  of them
                  to the Bishop only; according
                  unto whose appointment, <hi>in unum omnes</hi>
                   <hi>agitabant,</hi>
                  they met
                  together for the humbling
                  of themselves before God the Lord. So
                
                
                
                for disposing
                  of the Churches
                  Treasure (for <hi>Menstrua quaque die modicam quisque
                  stipem vel quam velit,</hi>
                
                every month the people used
                  to bring their Offerings,
                  as we call them
                  now, every man as he would and could) that also
                  appertained
                  unto the Bishop. Which as it was
                  distributed
                  most commonly
                  amongst the Clergy, for their present maintenance, so
                  was
                  it in the Bishops
                  power to bestow part thereof upon other
                  uses,
                  as in relief of Widows
                  and poor Virgins:
                  which appears
                  plainly
                  in that place and passage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                
                in his book <hi>de Virginibus velandis:</hi> where
                  speaking
                  of a <hi>Virgin</hi> which contrary to the custom of the
                  Church had
                  been
                  admitted
                  into the rank of Widows;
                  he adds,
                  <hi>cui si quid refrigerii debuerat Episcopus,</hi> that
                  if the Bishop did
                  intend to allow her any thing towards
                  her relief and maintenance, he might have
                  done
                  it without trespassing
                  on the Churches
                  discipline, and setting
                  up so strange a Monster as a <hi>Virgin-Widow.</hi> And
                  this is
                  that which after was
                  confirmed
                  in the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                
                where it is
                  said
                  , that the Bishop ought to have
                  authority in the disposing
                  of the things
                  (or goods)
                  that appertained
                  unto the Church; , that so he might
                  dispose them
                  unto such as stood
                  in need, in the fear of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally,
                
                for the <hi>reconciling</hi>
                  of a <hi>Penitent</hi> to the Church of God, in the
                  remitting
                  of his sins,
                
                and bringing
                  of him
                  back to the fold again; that in
                  <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                  time was
                  a Peculiar of the Bishop also. For,
                  speaking
                  of Repentance after Faith received
                  (<hi>de poenitentia post fidem,</hi> as he
                  calls
                  it) he is
                  content to give this <hi>efficacy</hi> thereunto, though
                  otherwise he held,
                  being
                  then a <hi>Montanist,</hi> that heinous
                  Sinners
                  after Grace received
                  were
                  not to be admitted
                  to Repentance; I say he is
                  content to give this <hi>efficacy</hi>
                  thereunto,
                  that for smaller
                  sins
                  it may obtain pardon or remission from the Bishop; for
                  greater
                  and unpardonable, from God alone. But take his own
                  words
                  with you for the greater
                  surety, and his words
                  are these, <hi>viz. Salva illa poenitentiae specie post
                  fidem, quae aut levioribus delictis veniam ab Episcopo
                  consequi potest, aut majoribus 
                  irremissibilibus
                   Deo solo.</hi>
                
                In which <hi>Pamelius</hi> seems
                  to wonder at his moderation, as
                  being
                  of a better temper in this point, than
                  was
                  <hi>Montanus,</hi> into whose Sect he now
                  was
                  fallen:
                  who would have no man to make confession of his
                  sins
                  to any other than to God, and seek for reconciliation
                  from no hands
                  but from his alone. And in another
                  place of the same book also,
                
                although he seem to jeer and deride the usage, he
                  granteth
                  that the Bishops
                  of the Christian Church did
                  usually
                  remit even the greatest
                  fins,
                  upon the performance of the Penance
                  formerly
                  enjoyned:
                  For thus he bringeth in the Bishop,
                  whom
                  in the way of scorn he calleth
                  <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Episcopus
                  Episcoporum,</hi> proclaiming
                  as it were
                  a general Pardon to such as had
                  performed
                  their Penance; <hi>Ego  moechiae 
                  fornicationis delicta poenitenti functis dimitto,</hi>
                  that he remitted
                  to all such even the sins
                  of Fornication and Adultery. Which
                  words
                  of his, declare not more his Errour,
                  than the Bishops
                  Power in this particular. What interest
                  the Presbyters
                  of the Church did
                  either challenge or enjoy in this weighty
                  business
                  of <hi>reconciling
                  Penitents</hi>
                  to the Lord their God, we shall see hereafter, when as
                  the same began
                  to be in practice, and was
                  by them
                  put in execution. Mean time I take it for a manifest and
                  undoubted Truth, that properly,
                  originally,
                  and in chief, it did
                  belong unto the Bishop both to enjoyn
                  Penance, and admit the Penitent; and not to the
                  inferiour
                  Presbyters,
                  but as they had
                  authority by and under him.
                  Which lest I may be thought to affirm at random, let us
                  behold the manner of this Reconciliation,
                  as layed
                  down by <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
                
                not as relating
                  to his own times,
                  but to the times
                  whereof we speak: , c. They
                  stand, saith
                  he, in an
                  appointed
                  place, sorrowful and lamented,
                  and when the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
                  is
                  ended,
                  whereof they are not suffered
                  to be partakers,
                  they cast themselves with grief and
                  lamentation
                  flat upon the ground. , The Bishop
                  then approaching
                  towards
                  him,
                  kneeleth
                  also by him
                  on the ground, and all the multitude also do the like,
                  with great grief and ejulation; ,
                  This done,
                  the Bishop riseth
                  first, and gently
                  raiseth
                  up the prostrate Penitent, and having
                  prayed
                  for those that are thus in the state of Penance, as much
                  as he thinks
                  fit and requisite, they are dismissed
                  for the present: And being
                  thus dismissed,
                  every man privately,
                  at home, doth afflict himself, either by
                  fasting,
                  or by abstinence from Meats
                  and Bathes
                  for a certain time, , as long as by
                  the Bishop is
                  enjoyned
                  him.
                  Which time appointed
                  being
                  come, and his Penance in this sort
                  performed,
                  he is
                  absolved
                  from his sins,
                  sins,
                  , and joyned
                  again unto the residue of the Congregation.
                  And this, saith
                  he, hath
                  been
                  the custom of the <hi>Western</hi> Church, and
                
                
                especially
                  of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ,
                  from the very first beginning,
                  to this present time. So that both in the City of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> in which <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  sometimes
                  lived,
                  and in the <hi>Western</hi> Church, whereof he
                  was
                  a member, being
                  a Presbyter of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and in the
                  times
                  in which he flourished,
                  for thus it was
                  from the beginning:
                  the Bishop regularly
                  had
                  the power both of enjoyning
                  Penance, and reconciling
                  of the Penitent as it still continueth:
                  Nor doth that passage in <hi>Tertullian</hi> any way
                  cross the point delivered,
                  where speaking
                  of the several acts
                  of humiliation which were
                  to be performed
                  by the Penitent, before he could be
                  reconciled
                  to the Church of God,
                
                he reckoneth
                  these amongst the rest, <hi>Presbyteris advolvi,
                  aris,</hi> or <hi>caris Dei adgeniculari,</hi> (for
                  whether of the two it is
                  <hi>adbuc sub Judice</hi>) <hi>omnibus fratribus
                  legationes deprecationis suae injungere;</hi>
                  to cast themselves before the Presbyters,
                  to kneel before the Altars,
                  or the Saints
                  of God, to entreat the Prayers
                  of all the brethren. Where clearly,
                  there is
                  nothing ascribed
                  unto the Presbyters
                  as in the way of reconciliation, but only in the way of
                  intercession, as unto other of the brethren: the main
                  work being
                  still reserved
                  unto the Bishop.

                I know indeed <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  is
                  alledged
                  by some,
                
                as if there were
                  a Government of the Church at that time in use, in the
                  which neither the Bishop nor the
                  Presbyters
                  did
                  bear the greatest
                  stroke; but a Society of Lay-Elders,
                  or (if we may admit such a Monster both in sense and
                  Grammar) a Lay-Presbytery. The place or
                  passage
                  commonly
                  alledged
                  to make good the same, is
                  that in his <hi>Apologetick</hi>
                  for the Christian Churches,
                  where having
                  shewed
                  the manner of the Christian meetings
                  in their Congregations,

                  being

                  probati quique seniores, honorem istum non pretio, sed
                  testimonio adepti;</hi> the Presidents
                  of our meetings
                  are approved
                  Seniors,
                  or Elders
                  (call them
                  which you will) who have obtained
                  this honour not by money, but by good Report. So he: And
                  those whom
                  he calls
                  <hi>Seniores,</hi> Elders,
                  they will needs
                  have to be such Elders
                  as they dream of, men
                  of the Laity, taken
                  in to day, and put out to morrow. A thing which better
                  might become the Conventicles
                  of the Heretick
                  and Sectary, than the Church of Christ. And as it
                  seems
                  amongst the Hereticks
                  and Sectaries
                  such a course there was,
                  <hi>hodie
                  Presbyter qui cras Laicus,</hi> that he which
                  was
                  to day an
                  Elder, was
                  on the next day to revert to his occupation;
                
                this day an
                  Elder in the Consistory, the next a
                  Botcher
                  on the stall. The Christian Church
                  had
                  no such custom, what ever might be found amongst the
                  <hi>Marcionites;</hi>
                  if then it be demanded
                  who these <hi>Seniors</hi>
                  were,
                  which are here said
                  to have presided
                  in their Congregations;
                  I answer that they were
                  the <hi>Bishops:</hi>
                  those at whose hands,
                  <hi>de manu Praesidentium,</hi>
                  the people used
                  in those times
                  to receive the Sacrament. Lay-men
                  they could not be, though called
                  simply
                  <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  because they did
                  administer the blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist:</hi> and simply
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  they were
                  not, and they could not be, because it
                  is
                  there said
                  that they did
                  <hi>preside,</hi> and had
                  the Power of <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Correction;</hi>
                  which are the works
                  and badges
                  of Authority. It then remains
                  they were
                  the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  the <hi>Presidents</hi>
                  or  of the Church of Christ, such as
                  we find described
                  before by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and are affimed by
                  <hi>Beza,</hi> to be such as <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  whom
                  we have proved
                  to be a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And this
                  appears
                  to me yet further by the words
                  themselves, in which we find that those who
                  did
                  attain that honour got
                  it by good Report, and not by Money. And this may very
                  well be, might the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  say, had
                  it been
                  spoken
                  of the Presbyters,
                  for who would give money for so poor
                  an
                  Office, wherein there was
                  but little to be gotten,
                  more than ones
                  labour for his pains;
                  or at the best some bare allowance from the
                  <hi>sportula,</hi> and that too on the
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  curtesie?
                  When we can hear you say the like of
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  through whose hands
                  the money went,
                  who had
                  the keeping
                  and disposing
                  of the common Treasury, and might enrich themselves by
                  the spoyl
                  therof;
                  you then say somewhat to the purpose. Till then it
                  makes
                  but little to the praise of your
                  integrity
                  and candour, that such poor men
                  whose places
                  were
                  not worth the haviing should pay nothing for
                  them.
                  This makes
                  it evident to me that the Elders
                  mentioned
                  here, were
                  not simply
                  Presbyters:
                  but such whose places
                  were
                  esteemed
                  to be both of Means
                  and Credit; and therefore doubtless they
                  were
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  that did
                  so <hi>preside.</hi> Nor is
                  it any prejudice to the truth thereof, that they are
                  called
                  <hi>Seniores</hi> in the plural number:
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking
                  not in the behalf of a particular Church or City,
                  wherein
                  could be one Bishop only; but pleading
                  in the behalf of the Universal, wherein there
                  were
                  as many <hi>Presidents,</hi>
                  or <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  or <hi>Presiding
                  Elders,</hi>
                  call them
                  which you will, as there were
                  Cities
                  gained
                  to the Faith of Christ.

              <p>
                Now if we please to take a view of the extent of
                  Christianity,
                
                according
                  as it stood
                  in the present Century, we cannot better do it, than by
                  a place and passage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who very
                  fully
                  hath
                  described
                  the same in his <hi>Apologetick,</hi>
                  presented
                  to the Magistrates
                  of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in the last year thereof,
                  or the next year after, as is
                  affirmed
                  both by <hi>Pamelius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> out of
                  ancient Writers:
                
                For having
                  shewn
                  that Christians
                  were
                  not to avenge themselves upon their
                  Persecuters,
                  or to take Arms
                  for the repelling
                  of those injuries
                  which were
                  offered
                  to them,
                  he doth thus proceed:
                
                <hi>Si enim  hostes
                  exertos,</hi> c. <hi>For should we
                  shew
                  our selves,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>to be open enemies
                  unto the State, should we want either strength or
                  numbers?
                  Behold what mischief is
                  done
                  daily to you by the</hi> Moors,
                  Marcomannians, <hi>and those of</hi> Parthia,
                  <hi>Masters
                  of a few Countreys
                  only; whereas the Christians
                  are diffused
                  over all the World; you count us
                  Aliens
                  or strangers
                  to you,</hi>  vestra omnia implevimus, <hi>yet we
                  have filled
                  all places
                  that are yours,
                  Cities,

                  Burrowes,
                  your places
                  of Assembly,
                  Camps,
                  Tribes,
                  Palaces,
                  the very Senate, and the Market-place, with our numerous
                  Troops.
                  Only your Temples
                  are your own, c. Nay, should we only go away from
                  you, and retire into some remote corner of the World,
                  and carry all our Families
                  with us,</hi> Suffudisset utique
                  dominationem
                  vestram tot qualiumcunque amissio civium, <hi>the loss
                  of so many of your people, how ill soever you conceive
                  of them,
                  would be so shrewd a weakening
                  unto your Dominions,
                  that you would tremble at that strange desertion, and be
                  astonished
                  at the solitude and silence of your
                  emptied
                  Cities,
                  quite destitute of men
                  to be commanded;
                  there being
                  more Enemies
                  than Citizens
                  remaining
                  in them.
                  Whereas now, God be thanked,
                  you have the fewer
                  Enemies
                  amongst you, in that you have so many
                  Christians,</hi>
                  Pene omnes cives Christianos habendo, <hi>most of your
                  People being
                  of that Religion.</hi> Which as it
                  shews
                  the great extent
                  of Christianity in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                  time, so doth it shew
                  a like extent also of <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> there
                  being
                  no place where Christianity had
                  been
                  received,
                  wherein <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was
                  not planted
                  also. Which lest it might be taken
                  for a bold assertion, without ground or Truth, I shall
                  crave leave to step a little out of this present
                  Century, and borrow a testimony from Saint
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who is
                  next to follow; and if he may be
                  credited,
                  will affirm no less:
                
                For by him
                  we are told
                  of a certain truth, <hi>per omnes Provincias  per
                  urbes singulas ordinatos esse Episcopos,</hi> that in
                  all Provinces
                  and in every City <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  had
                  long since been
                  ordained,
                  reverend for their Age, for their Faith sincere,
                  tried
                  in Affliction, and proscribed
                  in time of persecution. Nor doth he speak this of his
                  own time only, which was
                  somewhat after, but as a matter of some
                  standing,
                  <hi>cum jam pridem
                  per omnes provincias,</hi> that so it
                  had
                  been
                  long ago: and therefore must needs
                  be so doubtless in this present Age
                  being
                  not long before his own. And this extent of
                  Christianity
                  I do observe the rather in this place and time, because
                  that in the Age which followeth
                  (the multitudes
                  of Christians
                  being
                  so increased)
                  we may perhaps behold a new face of
                  things:
                  the times
                  becoming
                  quicker
                  and more full of action; <hi>Parishes</hi>
                  or <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches
                  set out in Country-Villages
                  and Towns,
                  and several Presbyters
                  allotted
                  to them;
                  with an
                  addition also both of trust and power unto the
                  Presbyters
                  themselves in the <hi>Cure of Souls,</hi>
                  committed
                  to them
                  by their <hi>Bishops;</hi>
                  with many other things
                  which concern this business. And therefore here we will
                  conclude this present Century, proceeding
                  forward to the next in the name of God.

                SAint <hi>Hierom</hi> tells
                  us of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                
                that he esteemed
                  so highly
                  of <hi>Tertulian</hi>'s
                  writings,
                  that he never suffered
                  any day to pass over his head without
                  reading
                  somewhat
                  in the same; and that he did
                  oft use to say, when he demanded
                  for his works,
                  <hi>Da mihi magistrum,</hi> reach me my <hi>Tutor</hi>
                  or <hi>Praeceptor.</hi> So that
                  considering
                  the good opinion
                  which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had
                  harboured
                  of the man, for his Wit and Learrning, and the nearness
                  of the time in which they lived;
                  being
                  both also members
                  of the same Church, the one a Presbyter, the other
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Carthage:</hi> We will pass
                  on unto S.
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and to those monuments
                  of Piety and Learning
                  which he left behind him.
                  And this we shall the rather do, because there
                  is
                  no Author of the Primitive times,
                  out of whose works
                  we have such ample treasures
                  of Ecclesiastical Antiquities
                  as we have in his; none who can give us better light for
                  the discovery of the truth in the present search than
                  that blessed
                  Martyr? But first, before we come to the man himself, we
                  will a little look upon his charge on the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> as well before, as at his
                  coming
                  to be Bishop of it; the knowledge of the which will give
                  special light to our following
                  business. And first for the foundation of the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                
                if <hi>Metaphrastes</hi>
                  may be credited,
                  it was
                  the action of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who
                  leaving
                  <hi>Rome</hi> at such time as the
                  <hi>Jews</hi>
                  were
                  banished
                  thence by the Decree of <hi>Claudius Caesar, in
                  Africam
                  navigasse  Carthaginensem erexisse Ecclesiam,</hi>
                  is
                  by him
                  said
                  to sail to <hi>Africa,</hi> and there to found the
                  Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> leaving
                  behind him
                  <hi>Crescens</hi> one of his Disciples
                  to be the Bishop of the same: But whether this be so or
                  not, it is
                  out of question, that the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi>
                  was
                  not only of great Antiquity, but that it also
                  was
                  of great power and credit, as being
                  the Metropolitan Church of <hi>Africk,</hi>
                  the Bishop of the same being
                  the Primate of all <hi>Africa,</hi>
                  properly
                  so called,
                  together with <hi>Numidia,</hi> and both the
                  <hi>Mauritanias,</hi> as well <hi>Caesariensis</hi> as
                  <hi>Sitisensis:</hi> So witnesseth
                  S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself, <hi>Latius fusa est nostra
                  Provincia;</hi>
                
                <hi>habet enim Numidiam  Mauritanias
                  duas sibi cohaerentes,</hi> as his own
                  words
                  are. And this appeareth
                  also by the subscription
                  of the Bishops
                  to the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  convented
                  <hi>ex Provincia Africa,</hi>
                
                <hi>Numidia,
                  Mauritania,</hi> as is
                  most clear on the record. For whereas
                  antiently
                  the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was
                  divided
                  into fourteen Diocesses,
                  reckoning
                  the <hi>Prefecture</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for
                  one; every Diocess
                  being
                  subdivided
                  into several Provinces,
                  as was
                  said
                  before, the
                  Diocess
                  of <hi>Africa</hi> was
                  not of the meanest,
                  containing
                  in it six large Provinces,
                
                and reaching
                  from the greater
                  <hi>Syrtis</hi> Eastward, where it
                  confined
                  upon the Patriarchat of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to
                  <hi>Mauritania Tingitana,</hi> on the West, which
                  did
                  belong unto
                  the Diocess
                  of <hi>Spain.</hi> Now <hi>Carthage</hi>
                  standing
                  in that Province, which was
                  called
                  <hi>Zeugitana,</hi> or <hi>Proconsularis,</hi> and
                  being
                  the Seat or Residence of the <hi>Vicarius,</hi> or
                  Lieutenant
                  General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for that
                  Diocess:
                  The Bishop of it was
                  not only the Metropolitan of his own Province, but the
                  Primate also, in regard of the other sive, which
                  were
                  <hi>Tripolitana, Byzacena, Numidia,</hi> and the two
                  <hi>Mauritanias</hi> before remembred.
                  Nor was
                  he only the supream
                  Bishop in regard of them,
                  but also absolute and independent in regard of others;
                  as being
                  neither subject or subordinate to the
                  Patriarchs
                  of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> though the prime City of all
                  <hi>Africa,</hi> nor to the <hi>Popes</hi>
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Queen and Empress of the world;
                
                against whose machinations
                  and attempts
                  the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> for a long time
                  did
                  maintain her liberty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such being
                  the Authority and power of the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                
                we must next look upon the Bishops
                  of the same; who though they had
                  not got
                  the name of Patriarchs,
                  as those of <hi>Antioch, Rome,</hi> and
                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> now had,
                  and they of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and
                  <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  shall be found to have in the times
                  succeeding;
                  yet had
                  they all manner of Patriarchal
                  jurisdiction. Of these the first I meet withal
                  was
                  <hi>Agrippinus,</hi> who flourished
                  in the beginning
                  of this Century, <hi>bonae memoriae vir,</hi> a man of
                  blessed
                  memory, as S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                
                <hi>Venerabilis memoriae,</hi> of venerable memory, as
                  <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> calls
                  him.
                  S. <hi>Austin</hi> also mentioneth
                  him
                  in one of his discourses
                  against the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
                  as a Predecessor of S. <hi>Cyprians;</hi>
                  and all of them
                  agree in this, that he held
                  those which were
                  Baptized
                  by <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
                  were
                  to be Re-baptized
                  by the <hi>Catholick</hi>
                  Ministers:
                  for agitation of which business he
                  caused
                  a Council to be called
                  of all the Bishops,
                  <hi>Qui illo tempore in Provincia
                
                
                
                Africae  Numidiae Ecclesiam Dei gubernabant,</hi>
                  which at that time did
                  govern the Church of God in the
                  Provinces
                  of <hi>Africk</hi>
                  and <hi>Numidia;</hi> in which Re-baptization of
                  men
                  so Baptized,
                  was
                  decreed
                  as necessary. Which howsoever it doth
                  shew
                  that <hi>Agrippinus,</hi> as a man,
                  had
                  his personal errors;
                  yet shews
                  it also, that as a Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he
                  had
                  a power and jurisdiction over all the other
                  Bishops
                  of the Diocess
                  of <hi>Africk,</hi>
                  and all the Provinces
                  thereof; who on his summons
                  met
                  in Council, as by those words
                  of <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly
                  doth appear. So that we find the holy <hi>Hierarchy</hi>
                  so setled
                  from the first beginners;
                  that as the Presbyters
                  were
                  subordinate unto their Bishops,
                  so it was
                  there a subordination amongst the
                  Bishops
                  themselves, according
                  as it still continueth
                  in those parts
                  of <hi>Christendom,</hi> in which Episcopal Government
                  doth remain in force. But <hi>Agrippinus</hi>
                  being
                  dead, his error or opinion died
                  also with him,
                  though it revived
                  again not long after; and his Successor, by name
                  <hi>Donatus,</hi> looking
                  more carefully
                  unto his
                  charge, endeavoured
                  what he could to free the same from erroneous
                  doctrines.
                  And to that purpose called
                  a Council of 90 Bishops
                  in <hi>Labesitum,</hi> a Colony in <hi>Africa,</hi> in
                  which <hi>Privatus,</hi> an
                  old Heretick
                  was
                  by their joynt
                  consent condemned;
                  <hi>nonaginta Episcoporum sententi
                  condemnatus,</hi>
                
                as <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath
                  it. By which we may conjecture at the great
                  spreading
                  of Episcopacy; over all this Province, I mean that of
                  <hi>Africa:</hi> So great,
                
                that at this time, being
                  <hi>An.</hi>
                  242. as <hi>Baronius</hi> calculateth
                  it, there could assemble 90 Bishops
                  at the command or summons
                  of their <hi>Metropolitan;</hi>
                  especially
                  if we consider
                  that these were
                  but a part of a greater
                  number.
                
                S. <hi>Austin</hi> telling
                  us of a Council held
                  in <hi>Carthage</hi> by the <hi>Donatists</hi>
                  (placed
                  by <hi>Baronius, Anno</hi> 308.) in which there
                  met
                  together no fewer
                  than 270 Bishops
                  of that one faction. But lest it may be
                  said,
                  as perhaps it was,
                  that the <hi>Donatists</hi>
                  increased
                  the number of Bishops
                  the better to support their party, if ever the business
                  should come to be examined
                  in a <hi>Synodical</hi> meeting;
                  we find a Council held
                  in <hi>Carthage</hi> under <hi>Aurelius,</hi> who
                  was
                  Bishop there in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
                
                <hi>Anno</hi> 398. in which Assembled
                  to the number of 214 Bishops,
                  all of them
                  Orthodox
                  Professors.
                  With such a strange increase did
                  God bless this calling.
                  For certainly
                  the Church had
                  never brought
                  forth such a large encrease,
                  if <hi>God, even our own God had
                  not given
                  his blessing.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                <hi>Donatus</hi> being
                  dead,
                
                <hi>Anno</hi> 250. <hi>Cecilius Cyprianus,</hi> a right
                  godly man, being
                  then one of the Presbyters
                  of the Church, is
                  chosen
                  Bishop of the same; and that not only by the
                  joynt
                  consent of the Clergy there,
                
                <hi>sed populi universi suffragio,</hi> but by the
                  general suffrage of the people,
                  according
                  to the general custom of that Church and time. And
                  being
                  so chosen
                  and ordained,
                  did
                  for four years
                  enjoy himself in peace and quiet. But a fierce
                  persecution being
                  raised
                  against the Church, by the command of <hi>Decius,</hi>
                  then the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor;
                  being
                  proscribed
                  and threatned
                  death, he retired
                  himself, expecting
                  a return of better times,
                
                wherein he might do service to the Lord his God:
                  Professing
                  that in this retreat he followed
                  the direction of the Lord, <hi>qui ut secederet
                  jussit,</hi> who had
                  commanded
                  him
                  so to do. In this recess of his, some of his
                  Adversaries,
                  (as who liveth
                  without them)
                  which had
                  opposed
                  him
                  in the time of his Election, taking
                  an
                  opportunity to ensnare the people, and draw
                  them
                  into factions
                  against their Bishops,
                  had
                  made
                  a very strong party on their side,
                  calumniating
                  his recess
                  as a deserting
                  of the Flock of Christ committed
                  to him,
                  which more afflicted
                  the good Father than the proscription of his
                  goods,
                  or any trial of his patience which
                  had
                  been
                  laid
                  upon him
                  by the Persecuters.
                  Of this conspiracy he certifieth
                  the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> by way of Letter,
                  wherein he giveth
                  them
                  to understand how the matter stood.
                  <hi>Quorundam Presbyterorum malignitas  perfidia
                  perficit,</hi>
                
                c. <hi>That I could not come to you before</hi>
                  Easter, <hi>the malice and perfidiousness of some of the
                  Presbyters
                  hath
                  brought
                  to pass; whilst mindful of their own conspiracy, and
                  retaining
                  their former rancor
                  against my being
                  Bishop, or
                  indeed rather against your suffrages
                  in my Election, and against the
                  judgment
                  of God approving
                  the same; they begin again to set on foot their former
                  opposition, renewing
                  their sacrilegious
                  machinations,
                  and lying
                  treacherously
                  in wait for my destruction. And after, in the same
                  Epistle,</hi> Non suffecerat exilium jam biennii, 
                   vultibus  oculis vestris lugubris
                  separatio, <hi>c. It doth not seem sufficient to
                  them,
                  that I have been
                  now two years
                  banished
                  from your presence, and to my great affliction
                  separated
                  from your sight; that I am
                  overwhelm'd with grief and sorrow,
                  vexing
                  my self with my continual complaints,
                  and day and night washing
                  my cheeks
                  with tears,
                  because it hath
                  not been
                  as yet my good fortune to embrace or salute you,
                  whom
                  you had
                  chosen
                  for your Bishop with such expressions
                  of your love and zeal.</hi> Accessit
                  huic tabescenti animo nostro major
                  dolor.
                  <hi>And yet a greater
                  grief afflicteth
                  my fainting
                  soul, that in so great distress and need I cannot come
                  my self unto you, fearing
                  lest at my coming,
                  if I should so do, some greater
                  tumult should arise through the
                  threats
                  and secret
                
                
                practices
                  of perfidious persons:
                  And that considering,
                  as a Bishop, I am
                  to take care for the peace and quiet of the Church,</hi>
                  ipse materiam seditioni dedisse, <hi>I might seem to be
                  or give occasion of some sedition likely to be
                  raised,
                  and so renew the persecution which
                  is
                  now well slaked.</hi>
                  Nay as it seemeth,
                  some of the Presbyters
                  of his Church which were
                  not otherwise
                  engaged
                  in the faction, or carried
                  any ill affections
                  towards
                  him;
                  out of an
                  inclination
                  natural to man, to enlarge their power, and get as much
                  authority into their hands,
                  as the times
                  would give to the advantage of his absence also, and
                  began
                  sensibly
                  to encroach upon his Office, and undertake such
                  things
                  as appertained
                  to his jurisdiction. Thus he complains
                  of his Clergy, that such as yet
                  stood
                  fair in their respects,
                  and firm in their obedience to him
                  might be confirmed
                  in the same: and that the rest,
                  being
                  made
                  acquainted
                  with their Errour,
                  might in fine desist, <hi>Tacere ultra non oportet,</hi>
                  c. <hi>It is
                  no time,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>to be longer
                  silent,</hi>
                
                <hi>when as the danger is
                  so imminent both on my self and on my people. For what
                  extremity of danger may we not justly
                  fear from Gods
                  displeasure, when some of the Presbyters,
                  neither mindful of the Gospel, or their own duty, or the
                  day of Judgment,
                  nor thinking
                  that they have a Bishop set over
                  them,</hi>
                  cum contemptu
                   contumelia praepositi totum sibi vendicent,
                  <hi>with the contempt and reproach of
                  him
                  that is
                  their Bishop shall arrogate all Power unto
                  themselves.</hi> Which their behaviour he
                  calls
                  also <hi>contumelias Episcopatus nostri,</hi> the
                  reproach and slander of his Government;
                  in having
                  such affronts
                  put on him,
                  as never had
                  been
                  offered
                  to any of his Fredecessors. The like complaint to which
                  he doth also make, but with more
                  resolution
                  and contempt of their wicked practices,
                  in an
                  Epistle to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> being
                  the 55. in number, according
                  to the Edition of <hi>Pamelius.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                I have the more at large laid
                  down the storms
                  and troubles
                  raised
                  against this godly <hi>Bishop,</hi> at his first
                  coming
                  to the place;
                
                because it gives
                  greater
                  light unto many passages,
                  which concern his time; especially
                  in that extraordinary Power which he
                  ascribes
                  sometimes,
                  both to the People and the Presbyters,
                  in the administration of the Church: as if they
                  had
                  been
                  Partners
                  with him
                  in the publick
                  Government. Which certainly
                  he did
                  not, as his case then stood,
                  without special reason. For being
                  so vehemently
                  opposed
                  from his first Election to the Episcopal Office; all
                  opportunities
                  espied
                  to draw away the peoples
                  hearts
                  and alienate their affections
                  from him;
                  every advantage taken
                  against him
                  during his absence from the City, to vex and cross
                  him
                  in his doings:
                  what better way could he devise to secure himself in the
                  affections
                  of the people, and the obedience of his
                  Presbyters,
                  than to profess that in all his
                  acts
                  and enterprises
                  whatsoever, he did
                  and would depend upon the counsel of the one, and
                  consent of the other. And this is
                  that which he professeth
                  in a Letter to the Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  of <hi>Carthage, quod  primordio Episcopatus mei
                  statuerim,</hi>
                
                <hi>nihil sine consilio vestro  consensu plebis
                  meae, privat sententi gerere;</hi> that he
                  resolved
                  from his first entrance on that
                  Bishoprick,
                  to do nothing of his own head, as we use to say, without
                  the Counsel of his Clergy and the consent of his People:
                  and that on his return, (for he
                  was
                  then in exile when he wrote
                  this Letter) he would communicate his
                  affairs
                  with them,
                  <hi>Et in commune tractabimus,</hi> and manage
                  them
                  in common with their assistance. And
                  certainly
                  this was
                  a prudent resolution, as the World
                  went
                  with him:
                  For by this means
                  he stood
                  assured,
                  that whatsoever Schism or Faction should be
                  raised
                  against him,
                  it would be never able to prevail, or get ground upon
                  him,
                  as long as he had
                  both the People and the Presbyters
                  so obliged
                  unto him,
                  for the support of his authority.
                  But this being
                  but a private case, and grounded
                  on particular reasons
                  makes
                  no general Rule: no <hi>Bishop</hi>
                  being
                  bound
                  unto the like, by this Example, but where all
                  circumstances
                  do concur, which we meet with here; and then not
                  bound
                  neither, except he will himself, but as it doth conduce
                  to his own security. So that it
                  is
                  to me a wonder, why the example of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  should be pressed
                  so often, and all those passages
                  so hotly
                  urged,
                  wherein the Presbyters
                  or People seem to be concerned
                  in matters
                  of the Churches
                  Government; as if both he and all other
                  Bishops
                  had
                  been
                  bound
                  by the Law of God, not to do any thing at all in their
                  holy function, but what the Presbyters
                  should direct, and the people yield their suffrage and
                  consent unto. For being
                  but a resolution taken
                  up by him,
                  the better to support himself against his
                  Adversaries;
                  it obligeth
                  no man to the like, as before I
                  said.
                  And he himself did
                  not conceive himself so obliged
                  thereby, but that he could and did
                  dispense with that resolution, as often as he thought it
                  necessary, or but expedient so to do:
                  performing
                  many actions
                  of importance, in the whole course and <hi>Series</hi>
                  of his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government,
                  wherein he neither craved
                  the advice of the one, nor the good
                  liking
                  of the other; and which is
                  more, doing
                  some things
                  not only without their knowledg,
                
                
                
                but against their wills,
                  as we shall make appear in that which
                  followeth.
                  Now whereas
                  the points
                  of most importance in the Government and Administration
                  of the Church, are the Election of
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  the Ordination of <hi>Ministers,</hi>
                  the Excommunicating
                  of the <hi>Sinner,</hi> and the
                  reconciling
                  of the <hi>Penitent:</hi> it will not be amiss to see,
                  what and how much in each of these St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  did
                  permit, as occasion was,
                  either unto the People or the Presbyters;
                  and what he did
                  in all and every one of these, as often as he
                  saw
                  occasion also, without their knowledg
                  and consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                First for Election of their <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                
                it is
                  conceived
                  and so delivered,
                  that <hi>all their Elections
                  were
                  ordered
                  by the privity,</hi>
                
                <hi>consent and approbation of the people, where the
                  Bishop was
                  to serve:</hi> and for the proof of this St.
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> is
                  alledged,
                  as one sufficient in himself
                  to make good the point. The place most
                  commonly
                  alledged
                  is
                  in his 68. Epistle touching
                  the Case of <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi>
                  two <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops,
                  who had
                  defiled
                  themselves with Idols
                  and many other grievous Crimes:
                  concerning
                  whom,
                  the people of those parts
                  repaired
                  unto him
                  for his resolution. But he remitting
                  the cause back to them,
                  tells
                  them
                  how much it did
                  concern them,
                  <hi>A peccatore Praeposito se separare,</hi> to separate
                  themselves from such sinful Prelates,
                  and not to participate with them
                  in the Sacrifice,
                
                giving
                  this reason for the same, <hi>quando ipsa maxime habeat
                  potestatem, vel eligendi dignos Sacerdotes, vel indignos
                  recusandi:</hi> because the people
                  specially
                  have power either of chusing
                  worthy Prelates,
                  or of rejecting
                  the unworthy. For that by <hi>Sacerdotes</hi>
                  here the Father understandeth
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                
                is
                  confessed
                  on all hands.
                  Nor doth the Father only say it, but he
                  goeth
                  forward to make good the same by Divine Authority,
                  <hi>ut Sacerdos plebe praesente,</hi> that the Bishop
                  should be chosen
                  in the presence of the People, under all mens
                  eyes:
                  that so he may be proved
                  to be fit and worthy by their publick
                  testimony. And for the proof of this,
                  is
                  urged
                  a Text from <hi>Moses</hi>
                  in the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi>
                  where God is
                  said
                  to speak thus to <hi>Moses:</hi>
                  Apprehende
                  Aaron fratrem
                  tuum, <hi>Take</hi> Aaron <hi>thy brother and</hi>
                  Eleazar <hi>his son, and thou shalt
                  bring them
                  to the Mount before all the Assembly,
                  and put off</hi> Aarons
                  <hi>garments,
                  and put them
                  on</hi> Eleazar <hi>his son. By which it
                  is
                  apparent that God willeth
                  the Priest to be made
                  before all the multitude,
                  shewing
                  thereby that the Priest should not be
                  ordained
                  but in the presence of the People, that so the People
                  being
                  present, the offences
                  of the evil may be detected,
                  and the merits
                  of the good made
                  known,
                  and consequently
                  the Election, or rather Ordination may be good and
                  lawful, being
                  discussed
                  by the opinion and voice of all.</hi> The like he also
                  proves
                  by the electing
                  of <hi>Matthias</hi> Bishop, in the place of
                  <hi>Judas,</hi> which was
                  performed
                  <hi>in medio Discentium,</hi>
                  in the middest
                  of the Disciples,
                  and in the chusing
                  of the <hi>seven,</hi> done
                  in the face of all the People. This
                  is
                  the sum of what is
                  there delivered
                  by St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> and out of this I find three
                  Corollaries
                  or Conclusions
                  gathered.
                
                First, that the special Power of
                  judging
                  of the worthiness and unworthiness of a man for the
                  Prelacy, was
                  in the brest
                  of the People.
              </p>
              <p>Secondly,
                The special Power of chusing
                or rejecting
                to his place, according
                as they judged
                him
                worthy or unworthy, resided
                in the People.</p>
              <p>Thirdly,
                That this power did
                descend upon the People, <hi>de Divina Autoritate,</hi> by
                Divine authority. These are the
                points
                collected
                from St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                words;
                which with the words
                themselves out of the which they are
                collected,
                are to be taken
                into consideration, because the weight of all this
                business doth rest upon them.</p>
              <p>
                And first as for St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  words,
                  there is
                  no such command of God touching
                  <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
                
                in any Bibles
                  now remaining,
                  as is
                  there laid
                  down, which thing <hi>Pamelius</hi> well
                  observed.
                  And more than so, the Text of Scripture now
                  remaining,
                  is
                  contrary to that which is
                  there alledged:
                  God willing or commanding
                  <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  to bring <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> his son, up
                  into Mount <hi>Hor,</hi> whither the people neither
                  did
                  nor might ascend,
                
                as it is
                  well observed
                  by our learned
                  <hi>Bilson.</hi> So that <hi>Eleazar</hi> not
                  being
                  chosen
                  by the People, but by God immediatly;
                  and his Ordination solemnized
                  on the top of the Mount, <hi>Moses</hi>
                  and <hi>Aaron</hi> being
                  only at the doing
                  of it: this can be no good Argument,
                  that the Election of the <hi>Prelate</hi> doth
                  specially
                  pertain unto the People. And therefore it
                  is
                  very probable that <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  met
                  with some corrupted
                  Copy of the Book of God; or else that we have none but
                  corrupted
                  Copies
                  of the books
                  of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> As for the Election of
                  <hi>Matthias,</hi>
                
                though it was
                  done
                  <hi>in medio Discentium,</hi> in the presence of the
                  Disciples,
                  as the Scripture tells
                  us; yet surely
                  the Disciples
                  had
                  no hand in the Hection: the calling
                  of an
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> being
                  too high a work for any of the sons
                  of men
                  to aspire unto,
                
                peculiar only to the Lord our God, to
                  whom
                  the choice is
                  also attributed
                  in holy Scripture. As for the <hi>Seven,</hi>
                  being
                  they were
                  to be the Stewards
                  of the People, in the disposing
                  of their goods
                  for the common benefit of the Church, as
                  before
                
                
                was
                  noted:
                  good reason that the Election should be
                  made
                  by them,
                  whose goods
                  and fortunes
                  were
                  to be disposed
                  of. So that there is
                  no Law of God, no <hi>Divine Ordinance</hi> of his,
                  expressed
                  in Scripture, by which the People are
                  entituled
                  either unto a special power of chusing
                  their Bishops,
                  or to a necessary presence of the action; though there
                  be many good and weighty reasons,
                  which might induce the Fathers
                  in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times,
                  not only to require their presence, but
                  sometimes
                  also to crave their approbation and consent in the
                  Elections
                  of the <hi>Prelate.</hi> Now for the <hi>presence</hi>
                  of the <hi>People,</hi> that seemeth
                  to be required
                  on this reason chiefly,
                  that their testimony should be had
                  touching
                  the life and behaviour of the party that
                  was
                  to be Ordained,
                  lest a wicked and unworthy person should get by stealth
                  into the function of a <hi>Bishop;</hi> it
                  being
                  required
                  of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> amongst
                  other things,
                  that <hi>he must have a good report.</hi> And who more
                  able to make this report, than the People are,
                
                <hi>quae [plebs viz.] singulorum vitam plenissime
                  novit,</hi> who being
                  naturally
                  inquisitive,
                
                know each mans
                  life, and hath
                  had
                  experience of his Conversation. And as for their consent
                  there wanted
                  not some reasons
                  why it was
                  required;
                  especially
                  before the Church was
                  setled
                  in a constant maintenance, and under the protection and
                  defence of a Christian Magistrate. For
                  certainly,
                  as our Reverend <hi>Bilson</hi> well
                  observeth,
                
                the People did
                  more willingly
                  maintain, more quietly
                  receive, more diligently
                  hear and more heartily
                  love their Bishops,
                  when their desires
                  were
                  satisfied
                  in the choice (though merely
                  formal) of the man; than when he
                  was
                  imposed
                  upon them,
                  or that their fancies
                  and affections
                  had
                  been
                  crossed
                  therein. But yet I cannot find upon good
                  authority,
                  that <hi>the special power of chusing
                  or rejecting,
                  did
                  reside in them:</hi>
                  though indeed somewhat did
                  depend upon their approbation of the party; and this no
                  otherwise than according
                  to the custom of particular Churches.
                  In <hi>Africk</hi>
                  as it seems
                  the use was
                  this, that on the death or deposition of a Bishop:
                
                <hi>Episcopi ejusdem
                  Provinciae quique
                  proximi conveniant,</hi> the neighbouring
                  Bishops
                  of the Province did
                  meet together, and repair unto that People, who
                  were
                  to be provided
                  of a Pastor, that so he might be
                  chosen
                  <hi>praesente Plebe,</hi> the People
                  being
                  present at the doing
                  of it, and certifying
                  what they knew
                  of his Conversation. And this appears
                  to be the general usage, <hi>per Provincias fere
                  universas,</hi> through almost all
                  parts
                  of Christendom: Where plainly
                  the Election of the new <hi>Prelate</hi>
                  resided
                  in the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of the same Province so convened
                  together:
                  and if upon examination of his life and
                  actions,
                  there was
                  no just exception laid
                  against him,
                  <hi>manus ei imponebatur,</hi> he
                  was
                  forthwith ordained
                  Bishop, and put into possession of his place and Office.
                  But it was
                  otherwise for a long while together,
                  in the great Patriarchal Church of <hi>Alexandria:</hi>
                  in which the Presbyters
                  had
                  the Election of their Bishop, <hi>Presbyteri unum ex se
                  Electum,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  noteth,
                
                the Presbyters
                  of that Church did
                  chuse
                  their Bishop from amongst themselves: no care
                  being
                  had,
                  for ought appeareth
                  in the Father, either unto the Peoples
                  consent or presence. And this continued
                  till the time of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> as he there
                  informeth
                  us, of whom
                  we shall speak more hereafter. But whatsoever interest,
                  either the Clergy in the one Church, or the People
                  challenged
                  in the other; there is
                  remaining
                  still a possession
                  of it in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> the
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Cathedral or Mother-Church
                  making
                  the Election in the name of the Clergy; the King, as
                  <hi>Caput Reipublicae,</hi> the head and heart also of
                  his people, designing
                  or commending
                  a man unto them;
                  and freedom left unto the People, to be present if they
                  will at his Election, and to except against the man, as
                  also at his Confirmation, if there be any legal and just
                  exception to be laid
                  against him.

                Next for the Ordination of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                
                it was
                  St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  usual custom to take the approbation of the People along
                  with him;
                  as he himself doth inform us in
                  an
                  Epistle of his, to his charge at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  inscribed
                  unto the Presbyters
                  and Deacons,
                  and the whole body of the people. <hi>In ordinandis
                  clericis, fratres charissimi,</hi>
                
                <hi>solemus vos ante consulere,  mores  merita
                  singulorum, communi consilio ponderare,</hi> which
                  is
                  full and large. Whatever he saith
                  elsewhere to the same effect is
                  in effect no more than what here
                  is
                  said;
                  and therefore we shall save the labour of a further
                  search. Nor was
                  this <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  custom only. It had
                  prevailed
                  as it seems
                  in most parts
                  of Christendom; and was
                  so universally
                  received,
                  that even the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours
                  took
                  notice of it. For <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> one of the
                  hopefullest
                  young Princes
                  in the declining
                  times
                  of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, noting
                  this custom of the Christians,
                
                was
                  wont when he promoted
                  any unto the Government of Provinces,
                  to post up, as it were,
                  the names
                  of the persons,
                  inviting
                  the People to come in against them,
                  if they could charge them
                  on just proof, with any crimes:
                  <hi>And used
                  to say it were
                  a shame not to observe that care
                
                
                
                in chusing
                  of the Rulers
                  of Provinces,
                  to whom
                  mens lives
                  and fortunes
                  were
                  to be committed;</hi>
                  cum id Christiani  Judaei facerent in praedicandis
                  sacerdotibus, qui sunt ordinandi, <hi>when as the
                  Jews
                  and Christians
                  did
                  it in publishing
                  the merit of those Priests
                  which were
                  to be ordained
                  by them.</hi>
                  Which kind of publication of the life and
                  merits
                  of the party, that was
                  to be Ordained,
                  may possibly
                  relate as well unto the popular manner of
                  Electing
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  at that time in use. But as there
                  is
                  no general observation,
                  but doth and must give way unto particular
                  occasions:
                  so neither was
                  this Rule so generally
                  observed,
                  but that sometimes
                  it was
                  neglected.
                  Even <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself how much soever it
                  concerned
                  him
                  to continue in the Peoples
                  favour, would many times
                  make use of his own authority, in
                  chusing
                  and ordaining
                  men
                  to Functions
                  and Employments
                  in the Church, without consulting
                  with the People, or making
                  them
                  acquainted
                  with his mind therein.
                
                For minding
                  to advance <hi>Aurelius</hi> unto the Office of a
                  <hi>Reader</hi> (an
                  Office, but no <hi>Order,</hi> in the Church of God) he
                  tarried
                  not the Peoples
                  liking
                  and consent: but did
                  it first, and after gave
                  them
                  notice of it: not doubting
                  of their taking
                  it in good part, <hi>(quod vos scio  libenter
                  amplecti)</hi> and so commends
                  him
                  to their Prayers.
                
                The like we find of <hi>Celerinus,</hi> a man
                  highly
                  prized,
                  admitted
                  first into the Clergy by him
                  and his Colleagues
                  then present with him
                  in his exile, and then acquainteth
                  the People that he had
                  so done,
                  <hi>non humana suffragatione,
                  sed divina dignatione,</hi>
                  not being
                  guided
                  in it by any humane suffrage, but by
                  Gods
                  appointment. And although <hi>Celerinus</hi> and
                  <hi>Aurelius</hi> being
                  known
                  unto the People by their former
                  merits,
                  the matter might be taken
                  with the less resentment; yet this no way can be
                  affirmed
                  of <hi>Numidicus:</hi> who being
                  before a <hi>Presbyter</hi> in some other Church,
                
                as <hi>Baronius</hi> very well observeth,
                  and in all likelihood utterly
                  unknown <hi>de facie,</hi> to those of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> was
                  by Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> of his sole authority, without
                  consulting
                  either with Presbyters
                  or People, (for ought which doth appear)
                  taken
                  into the number of the Presbyters
                  of that Church, <hi>ut nobiscum sedeat in Clero,</hi>
                  and so to have a place, together with the Bishop
                  himself, amongst the Clergy of the same, and that we do
                  not find as yet in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  Writings,
                  that the People had
                  any special power either in the Election or Ordination
                  of their Presbyters,
                  more than to give testimony of their well
                  deservings,
                  or to object against them
                  if they were
                  delinquent.
                  And more than that is
                  still remaining
                  to them
                  in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> in which the People
                  are required
                  at all <hi>Ordinations,</hi>
                
                <hi>that if they know any notable crime in any of
                  them
                  which are to be Ordained,
                  for which he ought not to be received
                  into the Ministery,
                  to declare the same,</hi> and on the declaration of the
                  same, the Bishop must desist from
                  proceeding
                  further. This is
                  as much as was
                  permitted
                  to them
                  in the Primitive times,
                  for ought I perceive; and yet the Church of
                  <hi>England</hi> gives
                  them
                  more than this: the <hi>Presbyter</hi> who
                  is
                  to serve the Cure in particular
                  Churches,
                  being
                  elected
                  by the Patrons
                  of them,
                  for and in the name of the rest of the People.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the power of <hi>Excommunication,</hi>
                
                I do not find but that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  reckoned
                  of it, as his own prerogative; a point peculiar to the
                  <hi>Bishop:</hi> in which he neither
                  did
                  advise
                  either with the Presbyters
                  or People. When as the wickedness of
                  <hi>Felicissimus</hi> the leader of the Faction
                  raised
                  against him
                  was
                  grown
                  unto the height, the Father of his own authority
                  denounced
                  him
                  Excommunicant <hi>abstentum se  nobis
                  sciat,</hi>
                
                as the phrase then was;
                  as he did
                  also on <hi>Augendus,</hi> and divers
                  others of that desperate party:
                  committing
                  the execution of his sentence to <hi>Herculanus</hi> and
                  <hi>Caldonius</hi> two of his Suffragan
                  Bishops,
                  and to <hi>Rogatianus</hi> and <hi>Numidicus,</hi> two
                  of the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  of his charge; whom
                  as for other matters,
                  so for that he had
                  made
                  his Substitutes,
                  or <hi>Commissaries</hi>
                  if you will, <hi>Cum ego vos pro me Vicarios
                  miserim,</hi> as the words
                  are. And they accordingly
                  being
                  thus authorized
                  proceed in execution of the same, and that in a
                  formality of words,
                  which being
                  they present unto us the ancient form of the
                  Letters
                  of <hi>Excommunication</hi> used
                  of old,
                
                I will here lay down, <hi>Abstinuimus
                  communicatione
                  Felicissimum,  Augendum, item Repostum de
                  extorribus,  Irenem, Rutilorum,  Paulam
                  Sarcinatricem; quod ex annotatione
                  mea scire debuistis.</hi> In which we may observe that
                  this <hi>Excommunication</hi> was
                  so published,
                  that all the residue of the Clergy, to
                  whom
                  the publication of it was
                  committed,
                  might take notice of it: <hi>quod ex
                  Annotatione
                  mea</hi> (or <hi>nostra</hi> rather, as
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi>
                  very probably
                  conjectureth)
                  <hi>scire debuistis.</hi> So that the process of the
                  whole is
                  this, that those <hi>Incendiaries</hi>
                  were
                  denounced
                  excommunicate by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself, the
                  execution of it left to those above
                  remembred,
                  whom
                  he had
                  authorized
                  in that behalf; and they accordingly
                  proceeding
                  made
                  certificate of it unto the Clergy of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  that publication might be made
                  thereof unto the People. Which differs
                  very little in effect from what
                  is
                  now in use amongst us. Nor did
                  St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> do thus only
                
                
                of himself, <hi>de facto;</hi> but he
                  adviseth
                  <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> one of his
                  neighbouring
                  Bishops,
                  to exercise the like authority, as
                  properly
                  belonging
                  to his place <hi>de jure. Rogatianus</hi>
                  had
                  complained
                  as it seems,
                
                of some indignities
                  and affronts
                  which had
                  been
                  offered
                  to him
                  by his Deacon: which his respect, in
                  making
                  his complaint unto him,
                  as <hi>Cyprian</hi> took
                  exceeding
                  kindly;
                  so he informeth
                  him
                  withal, that he had
                  the Law in his own hands;
                  and that <hi>pro Episcopatus vigore  Cathedrae
                  authoritate haberet potestatem qua posset de illo statim
                  vindicari;</hi> by vigour of his Episcopal function and
                  the Authority of his Chair, he had
                  power enough, to be straightway
                  avenged
                  of him
                  for the same. Yet being
                  the matter was
                  referred
                  unto him,
                  he declares
                  his thoughts,
                  that if the Deacon, whom
                  he writ of, would repent his folly, and give some humble
                  satisfaction to the offended
                  Bishop, he might not do amiss, to remit the fault. But
                  if he did
                  provoke him
                  further by his perverse and petulant behaviour;
                  <hi>fungeris circa eum potestate honoris tui, ut eum vel
                  deponas vel abstineas;</hi> he should exercise the
                  authority of his place, or honour,
                  and either degrade or excommunicate
                  him,
                  as he saw
                  occasion. Here was
                  no sending
                  to the Clergy to have their advice, no
                  offering
                  of the matter unto their better consideration, but all
                  referred
                  unto the Bishop, to do therein as unto
                  him
                  seemed
                  best, of his own authority. So that both
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other Bishops,
                  both might, and did,
                  and durst
                  do many things
                  without advising
                  with the Clergy contrary to what some have
                  told
                  us: And this they might do well enough, without dread or
                  fear,
                
                that any of their <hi>Sentences</hi>
                  might be made
                  <hi>irrita,</hi> or void, by the <hi>fourth Council of
                  Carthage;</hi> which was
                  not held
                  until 130 years
                  and upwards,
                  after <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s death. And for the
                  interest
                  of the People in these publick
                  Censures,
                  I find them
                  not at all considered,
                  but where the crime was
                  hainous,
                  and the Church scandalized
                  by the sins
                  and lewdness of the party punished.
                  In which case there was
                  such regard had
                  of them,
                  that the <hi>Sentence</hi>
                  was
                  published
                  <hi>in facie Ecclesiae,</hi> in the full Congregation of
                  Gods
                  people: And that as well that they might the more
                  heartily
                  detest such scandalous and sinful
                  courses;
                  as that they might eschew his company, and conversation,
                  as they would do the company of
                  an
                  Heathen or of a Publican: <hi>Tunc se ab ejus
                  conjunctione
                  salubriter continet,</hi>
                
                <hi>ut nec cibum quisquam cum eo sumat;</hi> not one of
                  them
                  so much as eating
                  with the man, who is
                  so accursed.
                  Which as they are St. <hi>Austins</hi>
                  words,
                  so by the tenor of the place, they seem to intimate St.
                  <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  practice. So that if <hi>Excommunications</hi>
                  had
                  not passed
                  in former times,
                
                without the <hi>knowledge and approbation of the body of
                  the Church, to which the delinquent
                  did
                  belong;</hi> as some men
                  suppose, it was
                  upon this reason only, as themselves affirm, <hi>because
                  the people were
                  to forbear Communion with such.</hi> And
                  being
                  that in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
                  <hi>Excommunication</hi> of notorious
                  sinners,
                  is
                  publickly
                  presented
                  unto the knowledg
                  of the People, for that very reason, because they should
                  avoid the company of Excommunicated
                  persons:
                  I see not any thing in this particular, (I mean as to
                  the publication of the <hi>Sentence</hi>) in which the
                  Church of <hi>England</hi> differs
                  from the <hi>Primitive</hi> and ancient practice. And
                  did
                  our Bishops
                  keep the power of <hi>Excommunicating</hi>
                  to themselves alone, and not devolve it upon others:
                  they did
                  not any thing herein, but what was
                  practised
                  by Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                For <hi>Reconciling</hi>
                  of the <hi>Penitent,</hi> which
                  naturally
                  and of course is
                  to come after <hi>Excommunication,</hi>
                
                I find indeed that many times
                  St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> took
                  along with him,
                  the counsel and consent both of his
                  Presbyters
                  and People. And certainly
                  it stood
                  with reason that it should so be, that as the whole
                  Church had
                  been
                  scandalized
                  at the heinousness
                  of the offence; so the whole Church also should have
                  satisfaction in the sincerity
                  of the <hi>Repentance.</hi> Many and several are the
                  passages
                  in this Fathers
                  Writings,
                  which do clearly
                  prove it: none more exactly
                  than that in his Epistle to <hi>Cornelius, where
                  wishing
                  that he were
                  in presence when perverse persons
                  did
                  return from their sins
                  and follies,</hi>
                  Videres quis mihi labor
                  sit persuadere patientiam fratribus nostris,
                
                <hi>you would then see, saith
                  he, what pains
                  I take to persuade our brethren, that
                  suppressing
                  their just grief of heart,</hi> recipiendis malis
                  curandisque consentiant, <hi>they would consent to the
                  receiving
                  and the curing
                  consequently
                  of such evil members.</hi>
                  Yet did
                  he not so tie himself to this observance, but that
                  sometimes,
                  according
                  as he saw
                  occasion, <hi>unus atque alius obnitente plebe 
                  contradicente, mea tamen facilitute suscepti sunt,</hi>
                  some, though not many, had
                  been
                  reconciled
                  and reimbosomed with the Church, not only without the
                  Peoples
                  knowledg,
                  but against their wills.
                  So that the interesse which the People
                  had
                  in these relaxations
                  of <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi>
                  were
                  not belonging
                  to them
                  as in point of right, but only in the way of
                  contentation. The leading
                  voice was
                  always
                  in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and so the negative voice
                  was
                  also when it came
                  to that: He was
                
                
                
                to give his <hi>fiat</hi> first, before the Clergy
                  had
                  any thing to do therein: St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  telling
                  of himself,
                
                <hi>quam prompta  plena dilectione,</hi>
                  that he received
                  such <hi>Penitents</hi>
                  as came
                  unto him,
                  with such affection and facility, that by his over-much
                  indulgence to them,
                  <hi>pene ipse delinque,</hi> he
                  was
                  even culpable himself. And if it
                  were
                  no otherwise in his time with the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> in this case, there it
                  appears
                  to be in the third Council there
                  assembled:
                  the Bishop had
                  not only the leading
                  voice, but the directing
                  and disposing
                  power,
                
                a negative voice into the bargain. For there it
                  is
                  ordained,
                  <hi>Ut Presbyter Episcopo inconsulto, non reconciliet
                  Poenitentem,</hi> that the Presbyters
                  were
                  not to <hi>reconcile</hi> a <hi>Penitent,</hi> unless it
                  were
                  in the Bishops
                  absence, or in a case of urgent and
                  extream
                  necessity: (as in point of death) it
                  being
                  there declared
                  withal, that it belonged
                  unto the Bishop,
                
                <hi>poenitentiae tempora designare,</hi> to appoint the
                  time, and the continuance
                  of the <hi>Penance,</hi> as he saw
                  occasion. And this to be the practice of S.
                  <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  time, is
                  most clear and evident, by the displeasure he
                  conceived
                  against some Presbyters,
                  who had
                  admitted
                  men
                  (which before were
                  lapsed)
                  without leave from him,
                  to the blessed
                  Sacrament.
                
                A matter which he aggravates
                  to the very height, charging
                  them,
                  that neither mindful of the Gospel, nor their own place
                  and station, nor of the future day of
                  Judgment,
                  nor of the authority of him
                  their Bishop; they had
                  admitted
                  such as fell in time of persecution to the
                  Churches
                  Sacraments,
                  not being
                  by him
                  authorized
                  so to do. And this he saith,
                  was
                  sure an
                  insolency, <hi>quod nunquam
                  omnino sub Antecessoribus factum,</hi> which never
                  had
                  been
                  done
                  in any of his Predecessors
                  times:
                  and being
                  now done,
                  <hi>cum contumelia  contemptu Praepositi,</hi>
                  was
                  done
                  in manifest contempt and reproach of their Bishop,
                  threatning
                  withal, that if they did
                  persist in these wilful courses,
                  he would make use of that authority, <hi>qua me uti
                  Dominus jubet,</hi> which God had
                  given
                  him
                  for that purpose; <hi>viz.</hi> suspend
                  them
                  from their Ministery,
                  and bring them
                  to a publick
                  tryal
                  for their misdemeanours,
                  before himself and all the People. 'Tis true indeed,
                  that in the outward action and formality
                  of this great work of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> the
                  Clergy did
                  impose hands
                  with the Bishop, upon the head of
                  him
                  that was
                  reconciled:
                
                for we find often in St. <hi>Cyprian, Manus ab Episcopo
                   clero imposita;</hi> but this
                  was
                  only, as I said
                  before, in the outward action; the power of
                  admitting
                  him
                  unto that estate, and giving
                  way to his desires
                  in making
                  of him
                  capable of so great a favour, belonging
                  only to the Bishop, as before appears.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus have we seen
                  how and in what particulars,
                
                as also upon what considerations,
                  Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> communicated
                  some part of his Episcopal Authority, either
                  unto the
                  Presbyters,
                  or to the People; or to both together. We will next look
                  on those particulars,
                  which he reserved
                  wholly
                  and solely
                  to himself: and they concern his Clergy
                  chiefly;
                  in his behaviour towards
                  whom,
                  in matters
                  of reward and punishment,
                  he was
                  as absolute, and supream,
                  as ever any Bishop since his time. And first in matter
                  of reward, the greatest
                  honour whereof the Clergy in his time,
                  were
                  capable,
                  was
                  their place of sitting,
                  distinct and separate from the People. A place by
                  <hi>Sozomon,</hi>
                
                called
                   as it were,
                  the <hi>Sacrarie;</hi> by the Council of
                  <hi>Laodicea,</hi> entituled
                  , by reason it
                  was
                  higher
                  than the rest, that all the people might behold it; by
                  others, <hi>Presbyterium</hi> the place for
                  Presbyters:
                  but by what names
                  soever called,
                  a place it was
                  appointed
                  for the Bishop and his Clergy only. Into this place St.
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> admits
                  <hi>Numidicus,</hi> a stranger to the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> as before was
                  noted
                  from <hi>Baronius:</hi> but by him
                  added
                  to the number of the Presbyters
                  there, <hi>adscriptus Presbyterorum Carthaginiensium
                  numero,</hi> as his own phrase is,
                  that so he might enjoy the honour of that place, with
                  the less distast.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so for point of <hi>maintenance,</hi> which
                  was
                  another part of the Reward, that
                  did
                  belong to the Laborious and painful Presbyter: the
                  distribution of the same was
                  wholly
                  in the Bishops
                  power. So wholly
                  in his power, that howsoever it
                  belonged
                  unto none of right, but unto the
                  Presbyters:
                  yet, he, having
                  bestowed
                  on <hi>Celerinus,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius,</hi> the place
                  of <hi>Readers</hi>
                  in the Church; did
                  also give unto them
                  or assign the same full maintenance,
                
                which was
                  allowed
                  to any of the Presbyters.
                  <hi>Presbyterii honorem

                <q>Know you <hi>(saith
                  he)</hi> in an
                  Epistle to the whole Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that
                  we have assigned
                  them
                  to the full honour of Presbyters,
                  appointing
                  that they should receive the same proportion of
                  allowance, and have as great a share in the
                  monthly
                  <hi>dividends,</hi>
                  as any of the Presbyters
                  had.</q>
                Where, by the way, this portion or allowance
                  had
                  the name of <hi>Sportula,</hi> from the
                  reward or
                  fees
                  which anciently
                  were
                  allowed
                  to Judges,
                  and by that name are mentioned
                
                
                in the Civil Laws;
                  which being
                  assigned
                  to the Presbyters,
                  <hi>pro singulorum meritis,</hi>
                  according
                  to the merits
                  of the persons,
                  to some more, some less, at the discretion of the
                  Bishop, gave
                  them
                  the name of <hi>Fratres sportulantes,</hi>
                  whereof we read in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Ep. 66. And they
                  were
                  called
                  <hi>divisiones mensurnae,</hi> the
                  monthly
                  <hi>Dividends,</hi>
                  because that as the contributions
                  of the people were
                  made
                  once every month, <hi>menstrua quaque die,</hi> as
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> a Presbyter of this Church
                  hath
                  told
                  us; so, as it seems,
                
                the <hi>Dividend</hi> was
                  made
                  accordingly,
                  as soon as the mony
                  had
                  been
                  brought
                  to the Bishops
                  hands.
                  So also in the way of punishment, when any of the Clergy
                  had
                  offended,
                  the Bishop had
                  Authority to withdraw his maintenance, and with-hold his
                  stipend. For when complaint
                  was
                  made
                  to <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Philumenus</hi> and
                  <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> two of his
                  Sub-deacons,
                
                and of <hi>Favorinus</hi> an
                  <hi>Acolythite, qui medio tempore recesserunt,</hi> who
                  formerly
                  had
                  forsook
                  their calling,
                  and now desired
                  to be restored
                  again unto it; although he neither would nor could
                  determine in it, before he had
                  consulted
                  with his Colleagues,
                  and the whole body of his People, (the matter
                  being
                  great and weighty) yet in the mean time he
                  suspends
                  them
                  from their monthly
                  pay, <hi>interim se  divisione
                  mensurna tantum contineant,</hi> as he there
                  resolves
                  it, leaving
                  the cause to be determined
                  of at better leasure.
                  This was
                  a plain suspension <hi> Beneficio,</hi> and
                  could he not suspend <hi>ab Officio</hi> also?
                  Assuredly
                  he both could and did,
                  as appears
                  evidently
                  by his proceeding
                  with these Presbyters,
                  who had
                  entrenched
                  upon his jurisdiction, as before
                  was
                  said.
                  Whose great offence, though he reserved
                  unto the hearing
                  both of the Confessors
                  themselves, and the whole body of the People for a final
                  end; yet in the mean time, <hi>prohibeantur interim
                  offerre,</hi>
                
                it was
                  his pleasure to suspend them
                  for the Ministery
                  from their attendance at the Altar. Suspend
                  them
                  then he might, there's no doubt of that; but might he
                  not if he saw
                  cause, deprive them
                  also. He might assuredly,
                  or otherwise he had
                  never given
                  that counsel to <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> that if the Deacon
                  formerly
                  remembred,
                  did
                  not repent him
                  of his faults,
                  <hi>eum vel deponat vel abstineat,</hi>
                
                he either might deprive or excommunicate
                  him,
                  which he would himself. He were
                  a very greedy Bishop, who would not be
                  content
                  with that allowance of Authority which S.
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> had.
              </p>
              <p>
                The like authority he used
                  towards
                  the People also,
                
                not suffering
                  them
                  to be remembred
                  in the Churches
                  Prayers,
                  if they had
                  broken
                  or infringed
                  the Churches
                  Canons:
                  And this appeareth
                  by the so celebrated
                  case of <hi>Geminius Victor,</hi> who at his death
                  had
                  made
                  <hi>Geminius Faustinus,</hi> one of the
                  Presbyters
                  of <hi>Carthage, tutorem testamento suo,</hi>
                
                the Executor of his last Will and Testament? which
                  being
                  like to be a means
                  whereby <hi>Faustinus</hi> might be
                  taken
                  off from his employment in the Ministery;
                  the displeased
                  Bishop doth declare, <hi>ne deprecatio aliqua nomine
                  ejus in Ecclesia frequentetur,</hi> that he should
                  neither be remembred
                  in the Offertory, nor any Prayer be
                  made
                  in his name in the Church. And this he
                  did
                  upon this reason, <hi>ne quis Sacerdotes  Ministros
                  Dei, Altari ejus  Ecclesiae vacantes, ad seculares
                  molestias devocet,</hi> that none hereafter should
                  presume to withdraw the Priest and
                  Ministers
                  of God from their attendance at the Altar in the
                  Churches
                  service, unto the cares
                  and troubles
                  of the world. Which passage
                  as it shews
                  expresly
                  the great tye
                  which the Bishops
                  of those times
                  had
                  upon the Conscience of the People,
                  whom
                  they could punish thus after death it self: So
                  is
                  it frequently
                  alledged,
                
                to shew
                  that neither Presbyters
                  nor Bishops
                  were
                  to be molested
                  with handling
                  of worldly affairs.
                  And so far I agree with them,
                  that Presbyters
                  and Bishops
                  are to be restrained
                  from these worldly matters,
                  so far forth as they are a molestation
                  to them,
                  whereby they are disabled
                  from the executing
                  of their holy function, as this <hi>Faustinus</hi>
                  seems
                  to be, <hi>ab Altari avocatus,</hi>
                
                quite taken
                  off from the attendance of his place; so far forth as
                  the ancient Canons
                  on the which <hi>Cyprian</hi> grounds
                  himself, they are and ought to be
                  restrained.
                
                But we have shewn
                  before that many secular affairs
                  were
                  not inconsistent with the true meaning
                  of those Canons,
                  as neither possibly
                  might this of <hi>Faustinus,</hi>
                  had
                  it hapned
                  at some other time, been
                  reputed
                  by him.
                  But at this time, partly by reason of the persecution,
                  and partly on occasion of the factious, the Church
                  was
                  almost destitute and unprovided.
                  This as he intimates
                  in his 35 Epistle,
                
                touching
                  the admission of <hi>Numidicus</hi> into the number of
                  their Presbyters;
                  so he affirms
                  the same at large in another place: where he
                  declareth,
                  <hi>plurimos nostros absentes esse, paucos vero qui
                  illic sunt vix ad ministerium quotidiani operis
                  sufficere,</hi> that many of the
                  Presbyters
                  did
                  absent themselves, and that those which
                  did
                  remain upon their Charge, could not suffice for the
                  performance of the daily offices.
                  So that the Church being
                  in that necessity, and such a manifest need or want of
                  Presbyters,
                  as then appearing
                  in the Church; <hi>Faustinus</hi> could the less be
                  spared
                  from the attendance on the Ministry, and
                  consequently
                  <hi>Geminius Victor</hi> the more unadvised, in
                  putting
                  him
                  on such a business
                
                
                
                by which he was
                  <hi>ab administratione
                  Divina avocatus,</hi>
                
                quite taken
                  off from the employment
                  of his calling
                  in Gods
                  holy Service. And this I rather take to be the true
                  condition of the business, and that which
                  gave
                  S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> so great cause of Anger, than with
                  <hi>Saravia,</hi>
                
                to affirm that the Decree or Canon whereof
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh,
                  was
                  but particular and provincial, <hi>illi tempori 
                  loco serviens,</hi> calculated
                  for the <hi>Meridian</hi> only of the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> and fitted
                  to the present time; the Canon being
                  ancient and universal, as before
                  was
                  shewn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another point,
                
                in which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> exercised
                  the height of his Episcopal Authority, (and
                  an
                  high point it was
                  indeed, as the times
                  then were)
                  was
                  in restraining
                  of those Indulgences,
                  which usually
                  the Martyrs,
                  or such as were
                  prepared
                  for Martyrdom, did
                  too promiscuously
                  bestow on <hi>collapsed</hi>
                  Christians.
                  For in the Primitive times,
                  the Discipline
                  of the Church being
                  very rigid and severe, such as in time of Persecution
                  had
                  denied
                  the Faith, either by offering
                  unto Idols,
                  or by some formal abnegation under their
                  hand-writing,
                
                whom
                  they called
                  <hi>Libellatici,</hi> were
                  doomed
                  unto perpetual penance;
                  no restitution being
                  to be hoped
                  for, to the Churches
                  favour, and to the benefits
                  and comforts
                  of it, until the very moment of their last departure.
                  Yet such was
                  the regard which was
                  born to those, who did
                  already suffer duresse
                  and imprisonment, and were
                  resolved
                  to suffer death for the sake of Christ; that such to
                  whom
                  they gave
                  their Letters
                  of recommendation,
                
                were
                  by the Bishops
                  readmitted
                  into the bosom of Church. And this at first
                  was
                  done
                  without any sensible inconvenience
                  following
                  thereupon, the Martyrs
                  or Confessors
                  rather being
                  very wary, on whom
                  they did
                  bestow those
                  favours,
                  and very sparing
                  of them
                  also. But when that it was
                  grown
                  so general, that either they did
                  <hi>pacem lapsis dare,</hi> receive such
                  men
                  into their favours,
                  and the Churches
                  peace promiscuously
                  without care and difference;
                
                or that the Presbyters
                  taking
                  their warrant for sufficient, without the leave and
                  liking
                  of their Bishop, admitted
                  them
                  to the Communion; then did
                  the Father manifest his dislike thereof, whereof
                  consult, <hi>Ep.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. For when it once
                  was
                  come to this, he first addressed
                  himself unto the Confessors
                  or Martyrs
                  to be more sparing
                  of the like Indulgences,
                  and after to the Presbyters
                  and People severally,
                  for the repressing
                  of this foul disorder. And when that would not serve the
                  turn, he resolved
                  at last, that for the time to come,
                
                <hi>Quamvis libello  Martyribus accepto,</hi>
                  such Bills
                  or Letters
                  notwithstanding, as they had
                  received
                  from those Martyrs,
                  they should stay his leisure, and the whole business
                  concerning
                  them
                  be respited
                  until his return. Which check thus
                  given,
                  and certain of the Presbyters
                  rebuked
                  and threatned
                  by him
                  for their officiousness in this kind, as before we
                  saw;
                  it came
                  to pass, that in a very little time, as well the
                  Discipline of the Church, as the Authority of the
                  Bishops,
                  reverted
                  to its
                  former rigor, especially
                  after that on the sight of this inconvenience, the
                  <hi>Lapsi,</hi> or <hi>Collapsed</hi>
                  Christians
                  were
                  by the general consent of holy Church
                  admitted
                  unto penance, like to other Sinners,
                  which as it hapned
                  chiefly
                  by S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  means,
                  so was
                  it brought
                  to pass in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  time. But here take notice by the way, that though these
                  Indulgences
                  had
                  been
                  granted
                  by these Confessors,
                  whilst they were
                  Martyrs,
                  but <hi>in voto,</hi> they were
                  not yet to take effect,
                
                as the late Learned
                  Bishop of <hi>Orleans</hi> very well
                  observed,
                  till that they had
                  received
                  the crown of Martyrdom, which he
                  proves
                  very evidently
                  out of certain places
                  of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> compared
                  together; for which I leave you to that Author. It
                  is
                  enough that the first check that
                  had
                  been
                  given
                  to that promiscuous liberty which the
                  Martyrs
                  took,
                  of doing
                  what they pleased
                  with the Churches
                  Keys,
                  was
                  given
                  by <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Whose foot-steps
                  one of his Successors
                  following,
                  after brought
                  to pass,
                
                that none should have the honour of
                  being
                  counted
                  Martyrs
                  after their decease, but such whose life and
                  sufferings,
                  and the occasion of those sufferings
                  were
                  first reported
                  by the Bishop of the place in which he
                  lived,
                  to his Metropolitan or Primate, and by the Metropolitan
                  to the chief Primate, who was
                  he of <hi>Carthage;</hi> who on
                  deliberation
                  was
                  to decree, <hi>Cuinam Martyris cultus deberet
                  impendi,</hi> who ought to have the honour and repute of
                  Martyrs,
                  as <hi>Baronius</hi> noteth.
                  And this he proveth
                  out of a passage in S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                
                wherein <hi>Mensurius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  writing
                  unto <hi>Secundus</hi> Primate of <hi>Numidia,</hi> (for
                  all the Metropolitans
                  of <hi>Africa</hi> were
                  called
                  Primates)
                  is
                  said
                  to have disliked
                  of those, which without cause or
                  questioning
                  exposed
                  themselves to open danger;
                  <hi>Et ab iis honorandis prohibuisse Christianos,</hi>
                  and that he did
                  prohibit the Christian People to give
                  them
                  that regard and honour which was
                  due to Martyrs.
                  And indeed <hi>Optatus</hi> speaks
                  of one who was
                  reputed
                  for a Martyr,
                
                <hi>Sed nondum vindicatus,</hi> but not
                  asserted
                  to that honour, not established
                  in it. So great was
                  the Authority of Bishops
                  over that of Martyrs,
                  whether dead or living.

              <p>
                But to return unto S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                
                whom
                  we have found so stout a Champion in the
                  defence of
                  his Episcopal Authority, that though there
                  was
                  a kind of necessity of complying
                  (as the world went
                  with him)
                  both with his Presbyters
                  and People, yet notwithstanding
                  he knew
                  how to resume his power, and neither take their counsel
                  nor consent, but on some occasions.
                  Had
                  he done
                  otherwise, he had
                  indeed betrayed
                  the honour of his calling,
                  which in the point of practice, which he so often doth
                  extol, both for Divinity of Institution, and excellency
                  of Jurisdiction, in the way of <hi>Theory.</hi> For if
                  we look into his writings,
                  we shall soon find what his opinion
                  was
                  touching
                  the institution of Episcopacy, which he
                  maintaineth
                  in several places
                  to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> no Ecclesiastical device, no
                  humane Ordinance. For grounding
                  the Authority of his calling
                  on those words
                  of Christ, <hi>Tibi dabo Claves,</hi>
                
                he sheweth
                  that ever since that time the Church
                  hath
                  been
                  constituted
                  upon Bishops,
                  and every Act thereof by them
                  administred.
                <q>Then adds,
                  <hi>Cum hoc itaque Divina lege fundatum sit,</hi> that
                  since it is
                  so ordered
                  by the Law of God, or by Divine Law, which you will; he
                  marveleth much that any one should write such
                  Letters
                  to him,
                  as he had
                  formerly
                  received
                  from some of the collapsed
                  Christians.</q>
                In his Epistle to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                he calleth
                  the Office of a Bishop in governing
                  the Church of God, <hi>Sublimem  Divinam
                  potestatem,</hi> an
                  high and Divine Authority, and tells
                  us of the same, <hi>de Divina dignatione
                  firmatur,</hi> that it is
                  founded
                  and confirmed
                  by Divine Providence or favour:
                <q>
                  In that unto <hi>Rogatianus,</hi>
                  
                  <hi>Apostolos,</hi> i. e. <hi>Episcopos 
                    Praepositos Dominus elegit,</hi> the Lord
                    saith
                    he, did
                    choose Apostles,
                    that is,
                    the Bishops
                    and Governors
                    of the Church: Therefore, if we that are the
                    Bishops
                    ought to do nothing against God, <hi>qui Episcopos
                    facit,</hi> who made
                    us Bishops,
                    so neither ought the Deacons
                    to do any thing in despite of us, who
                    made
                    them
                    Deacons.
                </q>
                Finally
                  in that unto <hi>Florentius Pupianus,</hi>
                
                who had
                  charged
                  him,
                  as it seems,
                  with some filthy crimes,
                  he affirmeth
                  often, that the Bishop is
                  appointed
                  by God himself, <hi>Sacerdotes per Deum in Ecclesia
                  constitui,</hi> that they are placed
                  in the Church by God, <hi>Deum Sacerdotes facere,</hi>
                  that God makes
                  Bishops;
                  and in a word, <hi>Apostolis Vicaria
                  ordinatione
                  succedere,</hi> they that succeeded
                  the Apostles
                  as their proper Substitutes.
                  As for the excellency of the Episcopal power, take this
                  once for all, where he affirmeth
                  to <hi>Cornelius, non aliunde haereses abortas
                  esse,</hi>
                
                that Schisms
                  and Heresies
                  do proceed from no other fountain than this,
                <q>That there is
                  no obedience
                  yielded
                  to the Bishop or Priest of God (for in the ancient stile
                  of many of the Fathers,
                  <hi>Sacerdos</hi> and Bishop is
                  the same) <hi>Vel unus in Ecclesia ad tempus Sacerdos,
                   ad tempus Judex vice Christi cogitatur;</hi> and
                  that men
                  do not think that there is
                  one Bishop only for the time in a Christian Church, one
                  for the time that judgeth
                  in the place of Christ.</q>
                
                Which words
                  since many of the Advocates
                  for the Popes
                  Supremacy
                  have drawn
                  against all right and reason from their proper purpose,
                  to the advancement of the dignity of the See of
                  <hi>Rome;</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  writing
                  this unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> then the Bishop there; we
                  may hear him
                  speaking
                  the same words
                  almost in his own behalf, <hi>Inde enim Schismata,</hi>
                  c. <hi>From hence,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>do Schisms
                  and Heresies
                  arise,</hi>
                
                <hi>whilst the Bishop being
                  but one in every Church, is
                  slighted
                  by the proud presumption of some
                  men;
                  and he by man is
                  judged
                  unworthy, whom
                  God makes
                  worthy of his favours.</hi>
                  And because possibly
                  it may be thought that <hi>Cyprian</hi> might be partial
                  in the heightning
                  of his own Authority, I shall crave leave to back
                  him
                  with Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words,
                
                none of the greatest
                  fautors of Episcopacy, who affirms
                  as much; who tells
                  us plainly,
                  that the safety of the Church depends
                  on the chief Priest or Bishop, <hi>Cui si non
                  exors
                   ab omnibus eminens detur potestas,</hi> to
                  whom,
                  in case there be not given
                  an
                  eminent and transcendent power, there will be
                  shortly
                  as many Schisms
                  in the Church, as Priests.
                  But it is
                  time to leave S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who
                  went
                  unto the Lord his God through the door of Martyrdom,
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 261. proceeding
                  from the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> to that of
                  <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the next neighbour to it.

                AND being
                  come to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                
                the first thing presents
                  it self to our observation, is
                  the Divinity-School there being,
                  which we must first take notice of before we look into
                  the Church, which in this Age was
                  furnished
                  hence both with Religious Bishops
                  and Learned
                  Presbyters.
                
                A School, as it appeareth
                  by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> of no small Antiquity; who
                  speaking
                  of the times
                  of <hi>Commodus,</hi> saith,
                  , that of an
                  antient
                  custom there had
                  been
                  a School for teaching
                  of Divinity, and other parts
                  of Literature, which had
                  been
                  very much frequented
                  in the former times,
                  and so continued
                  till his days.
                  According
                  to which plat-form,
                  first Schools,
                  and after Universities
                  had
                  their consideration in the Church; from whence, as from
                  a fruitful <hi>Seminary,</hi> she
                  hath
                  been
                  stored
                  ever since with the choicest
                  wits
                  for the advancement of her publique
                  service. But for this School of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the
                  first Professor there, which occurs
                  by name,
                
                is
                  said
                  to be <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> , a man
                  renowned
                  in all parts
                  of Learning:
                  first a Philosopher of the Sect of
                  <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
                  and afterwards
                  a famous
                  Christian Doctor. A man so zealously
                  affected
                  to the Gospel of Christ, that for the
                  propagating
                  of the same, he made
                  a journey to the <hi>Indies;</hi> and after his return,
                  he took
                  upon him
                  the Professorship in the School aforesaid,
                  , opening
                  the treasures
                  of Salvation both by word and writing.
                
                And I the rather instance in him,
                  because that under him
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
                  learned
                  his first Principles
                  of Religion; and after him
                  succeeded
                  in his Chair or Office: who being
                  by birth of <hi>Athens,</hi> and of the same family with
                  the former <hi>Clemens,</hi> the fourth Bishop of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> upon his coming
                  and abode at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  gained
                  the surname
                  or additament of <hi>Alexandrinus.</hi> Now that
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> was
                  Divinity-reader in the School of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                
                is
                  said
                  expresly
                  by <hi>Eusebius;</hi> where he affirmeth
                  also, , that <hi>Origen</hi>
                  was
                  one of his Disciples:
                  Who after coming
                  to the place himself,
                
                was
                  followed
                  in the same by <hi>Heraclas,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi>
                  successively;
                  both of them
                  Scholars
                  in the School of <hi>Origen,</hi> both
                  severally
                  and successively
                  Readers
                  or Doctors
                  in the same, and both, first <hi>Heraclas,
                  Dionysius</hi> next, Bishops
                  or Patriarchs
                  of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> So that within the space of half
                  an
                  hundred years,
                  this School thus founded,
                  or at the least advanced
                  in reputation by <hi>Pantaenus,</hi>
                  brought
                  forth the said
                  four famous Doctors,
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Origen, Heraclas</hi> and
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> all of them
                  in their times
                  men
                  of great renown, and the lights
                  and glory of their Age. And though I might relate the
                  names
                  of many other men
                  of fame and credit, who had
                  their breeding
                  in these Schools,
                  did
                  it concern the business which I have in hand; yet I
                  shall instance in no more but these, and these it
                  did
                  concern me to make instance of, because their
                  Acts
                  and Writings
                
                
                are the special subject of all that
                  is
                  to come in this present Chapter; and
                  were
                  indeed the greatest
                  business of that Age.
              </p>
              <p>
                And first for <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                
                not to take notice of those many
                  Books
                  which were
                  written
                  by him,
                  a Catalogue whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  gives
                  us, and from him
                  St. <hi>Hierom:</hi>
                
                those which concern us most, were
                  his eight books
                  inscribed
                  , which are now not extant, and
                  those entituled
                  , which are still
                  remaining.
                  In the first eight, he tells
                  us in the way of story, that <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and
                  <hi>John,</hi> after Christs Ascension,
                
                how high soever in the favour of their Lord and Master,
                  contended
                  not amongst
                  themselves for the place and honour,
                  , but made
                  choice of <hi>James</hi> surnamed
                  the <hi>Just,</hi> to be the Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem:</hi>
                  that <hi>Peter,</hi> on perusal of the Gospel, writ by
                  <hi>Mark,</hi> ,
                
                confirm'd the same by his authority, for the
                  advancement
                  of the Church that <hi>James</hi> ,
                
                to whom
                  the Bishoprick
                  of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  had
                  been
                  committed
                  by the Apostles,
                  was
                  by the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  done
                  to a cruel death: that <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, after
                  <hi>Domitian</hi>'s death,
                
                returned
                  to <hi>Ephesus</hi>
                  from <hi>Patmos,</hi> and going
                  at the intreaty of his friends
                  to the neighbour Nations,
                  , in some parts
                  he ordained
                  Bishops,
                  in others planted
                  or established
                  Churches,
                  in others, by the guidance
                  of the holy Spirit, electing
                  fit men
                  for the Clergy; telling
                  withal the story of a certain Bishop, to
                  whom
                  the said
                  Apostle did
                  commit a young man to be trained
                  up. All which he might affirm with the
                  greater
                  confidence, because he tells
                  us of himself,
                
                , that he lived
                  very near the Apostles
                  times,
                  and so might have the better light to discern their
                  actions.
                  And for the other eight remaining,
                  although there is
                  but little in them,
                  which concerns
                  this Subject, the Argument of which he
                  writeth,
                  not having
                  any thing to do therewith: yet in that little we have
                  mention of the several Orders,
                  of Bishops,
                  Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  in the Churchof God. And first for
                  <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  speaking
                  of the domestick
                  Ministeries
                  that belong to marriage, he shews
                  that by the Apostles
                  Rule,
                
                such Bishops
                  are to be appointed
                  for the Church of God, , as by the
                  orderly government of their private
                  families,
                  may be conceived
                  most fit and likely to have a care unto the Church.
                  Where clearly,
                  by his  he means
                  not <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  as the Apostle is
                  conceived
                  to mean in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> For
                  howsoever the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  might be trusted
                  with the charge of a particular Congregation; yet
                  had
                  they never the inspection, the care or
                  governance,
                  , of a whole Church, or many
                  Churches
                  joyned
                  together,
                  as the word  may be
                  rendred.
                  That was
                  the privilege and power of Bishops.
                  So for the two inferiour
                  Orders,
                  we find them
                  in another place,
                
                where he divides
                  such things
                  as concern this life, into ,
                  matters
                  of improvement and advantage, and ,
                  subservient only thereunto; then
                  adds,
                  that in the Church of God, the Deacons
                  exercise the subservient Offices;
                  , but that the
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  attend those others, which conduce
                  to our amendment or improvement in the way of godliness.
                  Out of which words
                  if any man can gather that <hi>judging
                  of the conversation or crimes
                  of any members
                  of the Church, that discipline, which
                  worketh
                  emendation in men,
                  is
                  in the power of the Elders,</hi>
                
                as I see some do, he must needs
                  have a better faculty of <hi>extraction,</hi> than the
                  best <hi>Chymist</hi>
                  that I know of. In all that place of <hi>Clemens</hi>
                  not a word of <hi>Judging,</hi>
                  nor so much as a syllable of Discipline. A power of
                  bettering
                  and amending
                  our sinful lives,
                  he gives
                  indeed unto the <hi>Presbyters:</hi>
                  but that I hope both is
                  and may be done
                  by the Ministery
                  of the Word and Sacraments,
                  with which the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  are and have been
                  trusted.
                  This is
                  the , the bettering
                  and improving
                  power which belongs
                  to them;
                  and not the dispensation of the
                  Keys,
                  which have been
                  always
                  put into other hands,
                  or if at any time into theirs, it
                  hath
                  been
                  only in a second and inferiour
                  place, not in the way of judging,
                  in the course of Discipline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next let us look on <hi>Origen,</hi>
                
                a man of most prodigious parts
                  both for Wit and Learning;
                  who at the Age of eighteen years
                  was
                  made
                  a <hi>Catechist,</hi> in the Church,
                
                and afterward a publick
                  Reader in the <hi>Schools</hi>
                  of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a man in
                  whom
                  there was
                  nothing ordinary, either good or ill: for when he
                  did
                  well, none could do it better; and when he
                  erred
                  or did
                  amiss, none could do it worse. The course and method of
                  his studies,
                  the many Martyrs
                  which he trained
                  up in the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> the several
                  Countreys
                  which he travelled,
                  either for informing
                  of himself or others, belong not unto this Discourse.
                  Suffice it, that his eminence in all
                  parts
                  of Learning,
                  and his
                
                
                
                great pains
                  in his profession,
                
                made
                  him
                  most grateful, for a time, unto <hi>Demetrius</hi> the
                  Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> though after upon envy
                  at the mans
                  renown, he did
                  endeavour
                  to diminish his reputation. For on occasion of the
                  Wars
                  in <hi>Egypt,</hi> seeing
                  he could not stay in safety there, he
                  went
                  unto <hi>Caesarea,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> See of
                  <hi>Palestine:</hi> where, though not yet in holy
                  Orders,
                  he was
                  requested
                  by the Bishop, not only to dispute in
                  publick,
                  as his custom was,
                  , but also to expound the
                  Scriptures;
                  and that too  in the open Church.
                  Which when it came
                  unto the knowledg
                  of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he forthwith
                  signified
                  by Letters
                  his dislike thereof: affirming
                  it to be an
                  unaccustomed and unheard of thing, ,
                  that any <hi>Lay-man</hi> should presume to Preach, or
                  Expound Scripture in the Bishops
                  presence. But hereunto it was
                  replyed
                  by <hi>Theoctistus</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  who was
                  also there, that he had
                  quite mistook
                  the matter: it being
                  lawful for such men
                  as were
                  fit and eminent,
                  to speak a word of exhortation to the People, or to
                  preach unto them,
                  , if they were
                  thereunto required
                  by the Bishop; instancing
                  in <hi>Euelpis, Paulinus,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi>
                  godly brethren all, who on the like
                  authority
                  had
                  so done
                  before; and they, for their parts,
                  being
                  of opinion, that others besides
                  them
                  had
                  done
                  so too. In agitation of which business, there are these
                  two things
                  presented
                  to us, first the regard and reverence, which
                  was
                  had,
                  in those Pious times,
                  unto the person of a Bishop; and then the power and
                  authority that was
                  vested
                  in them.
                  For first, it seems
                  that men
                  of whatsoever parts,
                  though of great spirit and abilities,
                  did
                  notwithstanding think it an
                  unfitting
                  thing, to meddle with expounding
                  Scripture, or edifying
                  of the People, in case the Bishop
                  was
                  in place. And yet as strange and uncouth as it
                  was,
                  or was
                  thought to be, the <hi>Licence</hi> of the Bishop
                  made
                  it lawful. But then withal we must conceive of
                  <hi>Preaching</hi>
                  in this place and story, not as a Ministerial Office,
                  but only as an
                  Academical or Scholastical exercise:
                  according
                  as it is
                  still used
                  in our Universities,
                  where many not in holy Orders,
                  preach their turns
                  and courses.
              </p>
              <p>
                And yet indeed <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  was
                  not so much out as they thought he
                  was,
                
                but had
                  good ground to go upon, though possibly
                  there was
                  some intermixture of envy in it. For whatsoever
                  had
                  been
                  done
                  in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches;
                  the use was
                  otherwise in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in the
                  Churches
                  of the <hi>West:</hi> in which it
                  was
                  so far unusual for Lay-men
                  to expound, or preach in the Bishops
                  presence, that it was
                  not lawful for the <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  For in the neighbour Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> it
                  was
                  thus of old, in these times
                  at least. For when <hi>Valerius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Hippo,</hi> a Diocese within that
                  Province,
                  being
                  by birth a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and not so well
                  instructed
                  in the pronunciation of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue,
                  perceived
                  his Preaching
                  not to be so profitable to the common People, for remedy
                  thereof, having
                  then lately
                  ordained
                  <hi>Augustin</hi> Presbyter, <hi>eidem potestatem dedit
                  coram se in Ecclesia Evangelium praedicandi,</hi>
                
                he gave
                  him
                  leave to preach the Gospel in the Church, though himself
                  were
                  present. And this, saith
                  <hi>Possidonius,</hi> who relates
                  the story, was
                  <hi>contra usum  consuetudinem Ecclesiarum
                  Africanarum,</hi> against the use and custom of the
                  <hi>African</hi> Churches;
                  and many Bishops
                  thereabouts
                  did
                  object as much. But the old man,
                  bearing
                  himself upon the custom of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church,
                  where it was
                  permitted,
                  would not change his course. By
                  means
                  whereof it came
                  to pass, that by this example, some
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  in other places,
                  <hi>accept ab Episcopis potestate,</hi>
                  being
                  thereto licenced
                  by the Bishop, did
                  preach before them
                  in the Church, without controul.
                  For <hi>Austin</hi> being
                  afterwards
                  Bishop of <hi>Hippo</hi> in the place of
                  <hi>Valerius,</hi> applauds
                  <hi>Aurelius</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                
                for giving
                  way unto the same: commending
                  him
                  for the great care he took
                  in his Ordinations,
                  but specially,
                  <hi>de sermone
                  Presbyterorum
                  qui te praesente populo infunditur,</hi> for the good
                  Sermons
                  preached
                  by the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  unto the People in his presence. But this permission or
                  allowance was
                  only in some places,
                  in some Churches
                  only; perhaps in none but those of
                  <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  For <hi>Hierom</hi> writing
                  to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> (being
                  himself a <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the Church of
                  <hi>Rome</hi>) complains
                  thereof <hi>ut turpissimae consuetudinis,</hi>
                
                as of a very evil custom, that in some
                  Churches
                  the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  were
                  not to preach if the Bishop were
                  by. And though he was
                  a man of great authority with <hi>Damasus</hi> and
                  others his Successours,
                  <hi>Popes</hi>
                  of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet got
                  he little by complaining,
                  the custom still continuing
                  as before it was.
                  And this is
                  clear by the Epistle of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> in which as
                  it is
                  declared
                  unlawful, to perform divers
                  other Sacred Offices
                  in the Bishops
                  presence,
                
                without his special Precept and
                  Command;
                  so also is
                  there a <hi>non licet</hi> in this point of
                  Preaching,
                  which was
                  not to be done
                  <hi>[nec populum docere, ncc plebem exhortari]</hi> if
                  the Bishop were
                  then present in the Congregation.
                
                
                So that this being
                  then an
                  ancient and received
                  custom, must needs
                  be now in force when <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  lived;
                  and, as it seems
                  by his expostulation in the case of <hi>Origen,</hi>
                  had
                  been
                  no less observed
                  in <hi>Alexandria</hi> than in <hi>Rome</hi> or
                  <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  There was
                  indeed a time, and that shortly
                  after, in which the Presbyters
                  of <hi>Alexandria</hi> might not preach at all,
                  , as it is
                  in <hi>Socrates.</hi>
                
                Which general restraint, as it was
                  occasioned
                  by reason of the factions
                  raised
                  by <hi>Arius,</hi> or other troubles
                  of that Church, in the beginning
                  of the Age next following;
                  so it continued
                  till the times
                  of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
                
                who lived
                  about the middle of the sixth Century, and take notice
                  of it. So that as it appeared
                  before in the case of <hi>Austin,</hi> that the
                  Bishops
                  have a power to Licence; so it appears
                  by that of <hi>Arius,</hi> that they also have a power
                  to silence.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to return again to <hi>Origen,</hi>
                
                the Bishops
                  of <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
                  finding
                  how profitable a Servant he might prove in the Church of
                  God, did
                  at another time, as he passed
                  through <hi>Palestine</hi> to go
                  towards
                  <hi>Greece,</hi> ordain him
                  Presbyter. And this was
                  done
                  , saith
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> by the Bishops
                  there,
                
                by the two Bishops
                  formerly
                  remembred;
                  no Presbyter concurring
                  in it for ought there we find. Yet when
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> moved
                  with his wonted
                  envy, did
                  not only what he could to disgrace
                  the man, but also sought
                  to frame an
                  accusation against those, ,
                
                which had
                  advanced
                  him
                  to the order of a Presbyter: We do not find that he
                  objected
                  any thing against them,
                  as to the Act of Ordination, but only as unto the
                  irregularity of the person, by reason of a corporal
                  defect of his own procuring.
                  And on the other side, when as <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  saw
                  his time, and found that some few
                  passages
                  in his many writings,
                  either by him
                  or in his name at least set forth and
                  published,
                  had
                  made
                  him
                  liable unto danger, obnoxious to the
                  censures
                  of the Church; he did
                  not only excommunicate him,
                  which had
                  been
                  enough either to right the Church or revenge himself,
                  but he prevailed
                  with many other Churches
                  also,
                
                to confirm the sentence. <hi>Ab eodem Demetrio Episcopo
                  Alexandrino fuisse excommunicatione
                  damnatum, prolatamque in eum sententiam 
                  caeteris quoque Ecclesiis ratam habitam,</hi> as S.
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> hath
                  it. Whereas before we had
                  his Ordination performed
                  only by the two Bishops
                  of <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  without the hands
                  of any of the Presbyters;
                  and yet the Ordination good and valid, the whole Church
                  after reckoning
                  him
                  for a Presbyter
                  without doubt or scruple; so here we find
                  him
                  Excommunicated
                  by one Bishop only, without the
                  votes
                  or suffrages
                  of the Presbyters,
                  or any shew
                  or colour of it; and yet the Church
                  concurring
                  with that Bishop, though his ancient Enemy, in
                  confirmation
                  of that censure. So fully
                  was
                  the Church persuaded
                  in the former times,
                  that these were
                  parts
                  of the Episcopal jurisdiction and authority, that there
                  was
                  no objection made
                  against this last, though <hi>Origen</hi>
                  had
                  many friends,
                  and those great ones
                  too; nor nullity or invalidity in the first, although
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who by reason of his great place and
                  power, had
                  made
                  him
                  many Enemies,
                  did
                  except against it.
              </p>
              <p>
                From that which doth occur concerning
                  <hi>Origen</hi> in the Books
                  and Works
                  of other Writers,
                
                proceed we unto that which doth occur
                  concerning
                  Bishops
                  in the works
                  of <hi>Origen.</hi> And there we find in the first place
                  the several Orders
                  of Bishops,
                  Presbyters
                  and Deacons.
                  For speaking
                  of those words
                  of the Apostle, <hi>He that desireth
                  the Office of a Bishop, desireth
                  a good work;</hi> he tells
                  us this,
                
                <hi>Talis igitur Episcopus non desiderat bonum
                  opus,</hi> that such a Bishop desireth
                  not a good work, who desireth
                  the Office, either to get glory amongst
                  men,
                  or be flattered
                  and courted
                  by them,
                  or for the hope of gain from those which believe the
                  Gospel, and give large gifts
                  in testimony of their Piety. Then
                  adds,
                  <hi>Idem vero  de Presbyteris  de Diaconis
                  dices,</hi> that the same is
                  to be said
                  of Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  also. Nor doth he only shew
                  us, though that were
                  sufficient, the several ranks
                  and orders
                  in the Hierarchy, but also the ascent or
                  degrees
                  from the one to the other, <hi>In Ecclesia Christi
                  inveniuntur,</hi>
                <q>
                  In the Church of Christ,
                  
                  saith
                    he, there are some men
                    who do not only follow Feasts
                    and them
                    that make them,
                    but also love the chiefest
                    places,
                    and labour much, <hi>primm ut Diaconi
                    fiant,</hi> first to be made
                    Deacons,
                    not such as the Scripture describeth,
                    but such as under pretence of <hi>long
                    Prayers
                    devour Widdows
                    houses.</hi>
                    And having
                    thus been
                    made
                    Deacons,
                    <hi>cathedras eorum qui vocantur Presbyteri praeripere
                    ambiunt,</hi> they very greedily
                    aspire to the chairs
                    of those who are called
                    Presbyters;
                    and some not therewithal content, practise many
                    ways,
                    <hi>ut Episcopi vocentur ab hominibus,</hi> to have
                    the place or name of Bishops,
                    which is
                    as much to say as <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
                </q>
                And shortly
                  after, having
                  endeavoured
                  to depress this ambitious humour, he
                  gives
                  this caveat, that he who exalts
                  himself shall be humbled,
                  which he desireth
                  all men
                  to take notice of, but specially
                
                
                
                the Deacons,
                  Presbyters,
                  and Bishops,
                  which do not think those words
                  to be spoken
                  of them.
                  Here have we three degrees
                  of Ministers
                  in the Church of God, one being
                  a step unto the other, whereof the Bishop
                  is
                  Supream,
                  in the highest
                  place. And not in place only, but in power also, and
                  authority, as being
                  the men
                  unto whose hands
                  the keys
                  were
                  trusted
                  by our Saviour.
                
                For in another place he discourseth
                  thus. <hi>Quoniam ii qui Episcoporum locum sibi
                  vendicant,</hi> c. <hi>When they which challenge to
                  themselves the place of Bishops,
                  do make the same confession that</hi> Peter
                  <hi>did,
                  and have received
                  from our Saviour the Keys
                  of the Kingdom of Heaven, teaching
                  that</hi> what they bind on Earth
                  is
                  bound
                  in Heaven,
                  <hi>and what</hi> they loose in Earth
                  is
                  loosed
                  in Heaven; <hi>we must acknowledge that what they
                  said
                  is
                  true, if withal they have those
                  things
                  for which it was
                  so said
                  to</hi> Peter. <hi>For if he be
                  bound
                  with the Chains
                  of his own sins,</hi>
                  frustra vel ligat vel solvit, <hi>in vain he
                  takes
                  upon him
                  to bind or loose.</hi> In the which
                  words
                  (not taking
                  notice of his errour,
                  seeming
                  to make the efficacy of the Ministery
                  to depend upon the merit of the Minister) we find that
                  in the time of <hi>Origen</hi> the dispensation of the
                  Keys
                  was
                  the Bishops
                  office. This, if it should not be sufficient to declare
                  their power, we may hear him
                  in another place calling
                  them
                  <hi>Principes populi Christiani,</hi>
                
                the Princes
                  of the Christian people, blaming
                  them,
                  such especially
                  as lived
                  in the greatest
                  Cities
                  (in which he secretly
                  upbraids
                  the proud behaviour of <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  towards
                  him)
                  for want of affability and due respect to their
                  Inferiors:
                  And writing
                  on these words
                  of our Saviour Christ, <hi>Who is
                  that faithful and wise Servant,</hi>
                
                c. he applies
                  them
                  thus, <hi>Peccat in Deum quicunque Episcopus, qui non
                  quasi conservis servus ministrat,
                  sed quasi Dominus.</hi>
                <q>That Bishop whosoever he be, doth offend against God,
                  which doth not minister as a Servant to his
                  Fellow-Servants,
                  but rather as a Lord amongst them;
                  yea, and too often as a sharp and bitter Master,
                  domineering
                  over them
                  by violence (remember how <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  used
                  him)
                  like the Task-masters
                  in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> afflicting
                  the poor <hi>Israelites</hi>
                  by force.</q>
                Finally,
                  as he doth acquaint us with their power and eminency, so
                  doth he tell us also of their care and service;
                
                assuring
                  us, that he who is
                  called
                  unto the Office of a Bishop, <hi>non vocatur ad
                  principatum, sed ad servitutem totius Ecclesiae,</hi>
                  is
                  not invited
                  to an
                  Empire or a Principality, but to the Service of the
                  whole Church. And this he keeps
                  himself to constantly
                  in that whole discourse (being
                  the sixth Homily on the Prophet
                  <hi>Esay</hi>)
                  in which although he afterwards
                  doth call the Bishop, <hi>Ecclesiae Princeps,</hi> yet
                  he affirms
                  that he is
                  called
                  <hi>ad servitutem,</hi> to a place of service; and that
                  by looking
                  to his service well, <hi>ad solium coeleste ire
                  posset,</hi> he may attain an
                  Heavenly Throne. And so much shall suffice for
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> a Learned
                  but unfortunate man, with whom
                  the Church had
                  never peace, either dead or living.
              </p>
              <p>
                From him
                  then we proceed unto his Successor,
                
                <hi>Heraclas,</hi> an
                  Auditor at first of <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                
                then of <hi>Origen,</hi> who being
                  marvellously
                  affected
                  with the great Learning
                  of the man, ,
                  made
                  him
                  his Partner in the Chair; which after <hi>Origen</hi>
                  was
                  laid
                  by,
                
                he managed
                  wholly
                  by himself with great applause. A man that
                  had
                  the happiness to succeed the two
                  greatest
                  Enemies
                  in the world, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Demetrius;</hi>
                  the one in the Schools,
                  the other in the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> unto
                  which honour he was
                  called
                  on <hi>Demetrius</hi> death, who
                  had
                  sate Bishop there three and forty
                  years.
                  On this preferment of <hi>Heraclas</hi> unto the
                  Patriarchate, the Regency of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi>
                  Schools,
                  was
                  forthwith given
                  to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> another of <hi>Origens</hi>
                  Disciples,
                  who after fourteen years
                  or thereabout, succeeded
                  also in the Bishoprick.
                  And here began
                  that alteration in the Election of the
                  Bishops
                  of this Church, which S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  speaks
                  of.
                
                The Presbyters
                  before this time used
                  to Elect their Bishop from among themselves.
                  <hi>Alexandriae  Marco Evangelista usque ad
                  Heraclam  Dionysium Episcopos, Presbyteri unum ex
                  se electum, in excelsiori gradu collocatum, Episcopum
                  nominabant,</hi> as the Father hath
                  it. But here we find that course
                  was
                  altered,
                  though what the alteration was,
                  in what it did
                  consist, whether in the Electors,
                  or the condition of the party to be
                  Elected,
                  is
                  not so clearly
                  evident in S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s
                  words.
                  For my part, I conceive it might be in both, both in the
                  <hi>unum ex se,</hi> and the <hi>collocabant.</hi> For
                  first the Presbyters
                  of that Church had
                  used
                  to choose their Bishop from amongst themselves,
                  Electing
                  always
                  one of their own body. But in the choice of these two
                  Bishops
                  that course was
                  altered;
                  these two not being
                  Presbyters
                  of the Church, but Readers
                  in the Schools
                  of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and so not
                  chosen
                  from amongst themselves. And secondly,
                  I take it that the course was
                  altered,
                  as to the Electors,
                  to the <hi>Collocabant.</hi> For whereas
                  heretofore
                  the Presbyters
                  had
                  the sole power of the Election, to choose
                  whom
                  they listed,
                  and having
                  chosen,
                  to enthrone him
                  without expecting
                  what the people were
                  pleased
                  to do; the people seeing
                  what was
                  done
                  in other Churches,
                  begun
                  to put in for a share,
                
                
                not only ruling,
                  but finally
                  over-ruling
                  the Election. What else should further the Election of
                  these two, I can hardly
                  tell; but that their diligence and assiduity in the
                  discharge of the employment they
                  had
                  took
                  upon them;
                  the great abilities
                  they shewed
                  therein, and the great satisfaction
                  given
                  thereby unto the people, who carefully
                  frequented
                  those publick
                  Readings,
                  had
                  so endeared
                  them
                  to the multitude, that no other
                  Bishops
                  could content them,
                  had
                  not these been
                  chosen.
                  And this I am
                  the rather induced
                  to think, because that in a short time after, the
                  interess of the people in the Election
                  of their Bishop was
                  improved
                  so high, that the want of their consent and suffrage
                  was
                  thought by <hi>Athanasius</hi> a sufficient bar against
                  the right of the Elected,
                
                affirming
                  it to be against the Churches
                  Canons,
                  , and to the
                  precept of
                  the Apostles.
                  But which of these soever it was,
                  an
                  alteration here was
                  made
                  of the ancient custom, which is
                  as much as is
                  intended
                  by S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the words
                  alledged.
                  How others have abused
                  this place, to prove that the imparity of
                  Bishops
                  is
                  not of Divine Authority, but only
                  brought
                  in by the Presbyters,
                  we have shewn
                  before. <hi>Part</hi> I. <hi>Cha.</hi> 3.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to go on with <hi>Dionysius</hi> (for of
                  <hi>Heraclas</hi> and his acts
                  there is
                  little mention) we find the time in which he sate to be
                  full of troubles;
                
                both in regard of Persecutions
                  which were
                  raised
                  against the Church without, and
                  Heresies
                  which assaulted
                  her within. <hi>Novatus</hi> had
                  begun
                  a faction in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  grounding
                  the same upon a false and dangerous doctrine; the sum
                  whereof we find in an
                  Epistle of this <hi>Dionysius,</hi>
                
                unto another <hi>Dionysius</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  And whereas <hi>Fabius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Antiochia,</hi> was
                  thought to be a fautor of that Schism, he writes to
                  him
                  about it also.
                
                So when <hi>Sabellius</hi> had
                  begun
                  to disperse his Heresies,
                  he presently
                  gives
                  notice of it to <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or <hi>Xystus</hi>
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as also unto
                  <hi>Ammon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bernice,</hi> and
                  <hi>Basilides</hi> the Metropolitan of
                  <hi>Cyrenaica</hi> or <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> and to
                  divers
                  others. And when that <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi>
                  began
                  to broach strange doctrins
                  in the Church of Christ, although he could not go in
                  person to suppress the same, yet writ he
                  an
                  Epistle to the Bishops
                  Assembled
                  there, , declaring
                  his opinion of the point in question. And on the other
                  side, when as the Persecutors
                  made
                  foul havock
                  in the Church, and threatned
                  utterly
                  to destroy the Professors
                  of it;
                
                he by his Letters
                  certifieth
                  his neighbouring
                  Bishops
                  in what estate Gods
                  Church stood
                  with him,
                  with what heroick
                  resolutions
                  the Christians
                  in his charge did
                  abide the fury, and conquered
                  their tormenters
                  by their patient sufferings;
                  so giving
                  houour to the dead, and breathing
                  courage in the living.
                  Indeed what Bishops
                  almost were
                  there in those parts
                  of Christendom, with whom
                  he held
                  not correspondence, with whom
                  he had
                  not mutual and continual entercourse
                  by the way of Letters,
                  from whom
                  he did
                  not carefully
                  receive in the self-same way both advice and comfort?
                  Witness his several Epistles,
                  besides
                  those formerly
                  remembred,
                  unto <hi>Cornelius</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                commending
                  him
                  for an
                  Epistle by him
                  written
                  against <hi>Novatus;</hi> and giving
                  notice to him
                  of the death of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and how
                  <hi>Demetrianus</hi> did
                  succeed him
                  in the See of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and also to the Church
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> discoursing
                  of the publick
                  Ministeries
                  in the Christian Church. Witness that also unto
                  <hi>Stephanus,</hi> the Predecessor of
                  <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                entituled
                  <hi>De Baptismate;</hi> a second to the aforesaid
                  <hi>Stephanus,</hi> about the faction of
                  <hi>Novatus.</hi> To <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> besides
                  that before remembred
                  from <hi>Eusebius,</hi> a second
                  extant in
                  the works
                  of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And one to <hi>Paulus
                  Samosatenus,</hi>
                
                the wretched Patriarch
                  of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> of which though there
                  is
                  no mention in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who
                  tells
                  us that he would not vouchsafe to write unto
                  him,
                  yet is
                  it intimated
                  in <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> who affirmes
                  the contrray, and extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca
                  Patrum,</hi> and in the Annals
                  of <hi>Baronius.</hi>
                  It were
                  an
                  infinite and endless labour to recite all those, which
                  besides
                  these inscribed
                  unto the Bishops
                  of the greater
                  Churches,
                  he writ and sent
                  to others of less note and quality, as <hi>viz.</hi> to
                  <hi>Conon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> the
                  Churches
                  of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi>
                  , and to whom
                  not almost either Priest or Bishop that
                  was
                  of any merit and consideration in the Church of Christ?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you demand to what end serves
                  this general muster of the Epistles
                  of this <hi>Prelate,</hi>
                
                why I have brought
                  them
                  thus into the field in their ranks
                  and files,
                  I answer that it was
                  to let you see what was
                  the ancient form of government in the Church of Christ,
                  before they had
                  the happiness to live under Christian
                  Princes,
                  and thereby opportunity of meeting
                  in their General Councils.
                  For all the Apostles
                  being
                  furnished
                  by our Lord and Saviour, with an
                  equality of power and honour; <hi>pari consortio
                  praediti potestatis
                   honoris,</hi> as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  hath
                  it;
                
                by consequence all Bishops
                  also were
                  founded
                  in the like equality. So that the government of the
                  Church, as to the outward form and
                
                
                
                polity thereof, was
                  <hi>Aristocratical.</hi> And being
                  so, there was
                  in manner a necessity imposed
                  upon the <hi>Prelates</hi>
                  of the Church, to maintain mutual
                  entercourse
                  and correspondence
                  betwixt one another by Letters,
                  Messages,
                  and Agents,
                  for the communicating
                  of their Councils,
                  and imparting
                  their advice, as occasion was
                  in all omergent dangers
                  of the Church. For howsoever that the Church
                  had
                  followed
                  in some things
                  the pattern of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in each
                  Diocess
                  thereof (taking
                  the Word according
                  to the civil sense) had
                  instituted
                  and ordained
                  a <hi>Primate,</hi> to whom
                  the final resolution of all businesses
                  did
                  appertain, that fell within the compass of that
                  Diocess:
                  Yet all these <hi>Primates</hi>
                  being
                  of equal power and authority, each of
                  them
                  absolute and independent with the
                  bounds
                  and limits
                  of his own jurisdiction, there was
                  no other way to compose such differences
                  as were
                  either indeterminable at home, or otherwise
                  concerned
                  the publick,
                  but this of mutual entercourse
                  and correspondence. And this, what ever
                  is
                  opined
                  unto the contrary both by the Masters
                  and the Scholars
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have
                  advanced
                  the <hi>Pope</hi> into the Soveraign
                  or Supream
                  direction
                  in all points
                  of doubt; will prove to be the practice of the Christian
                  Church in all times
                  and Ages,
                  till the Authority of all other
                  Churches
                  in the worst and darkest
                  times
                  of Christianity, came
                  to be swallowed
                  up in the gulph
                  of <hi>Rome.</hi> For presently
                  upon the death of the Apostles,
                  who questionless had
                  the frequent resort, the final ending
                  of all businesses
                  which concerned
                  the Church, a full and plenary authority to
                  direct the
                  same;
                
                we find that <hi>Clemens,</hi> one of their
                  Disciples,
                  sends
                  his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for the
                  composing
                  of some Schisms
                  which were
                  raised
                  amongst them,
                  and that <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  another of their Scholars
                  sends
                  the like to <hi>Rome,</hi> for their
                  confirming
                  in the faith. Besides
                  which, as he travelled
                  towards
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather was
                  haled
                  thither to his Execution, he dispatched
                  others of his Epistles
                  unto other Churches,
                  and one amongst the rest unto <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Bishop
                  of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> commending
                  unto him
                  the good estate of the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                
                The like we find of <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi> a right godly man, of whose
                  Epistles
                  to the <hi>Lacedemonians,
                  Athenians,
                  Nicomedians,</hi> and those of <hi>Crete;</hi> as also
                  to the Churches
                  in <hi>Pontus,</hi> nay to that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  conducing
                  either to the beating
                  down of Heresies,
                  or to the preservation of peace and unity, or to the
                  confirmation of the faith, or rectifying
                  of what was
                  amiss in the Churches
                  discipline, there is
                  full mention in <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus when <hi>Pope Victor</hi> by his rash
                  perversness
                  had
                  almost plunged
                  the Church in an
                  endless broil;
                
                the Bishops
                  of these times
                  bestirred
                  themselves by publique
                  writings
                  to compose the quarrel; particularly
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Polyerates,</hi> the one the
                  Metropolitan of the <hi>Gallick,</hi>
                  the other of the <hi>Asian</hi>
                  Churches.
                  And when that many of the Bishops
                  severally
                  had
                  convocated
                  Councils
                  and Synodical meetings
                  to make up this breach; upon the
                  rising
                  of the same they sent
                  out their Letters,
                
                signifying
                  what they had
                  Decreed,
                  advising
                  what they would have done
                  by all Christian people.
                
                For though <hi>Eusebius</hi> instanceth
                  in none but the Bishops
                  of <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  (in the records
                  of which, in two Churches,
                  he had
                  been
                  most versed)
                  which sent
                  out these Synodical Epistles;
                  yet being
                  so many other Metropolitans
                  had
                  called
                  Synods
                  also to the same intent, I doubt not but they
                  took
                  the same course as the others did
                  in manifesting
                  their Decrees
                  and Counsels.
                  Nay so exact and punctual they were
                  in the continuance of this mutual amity and
                  correspondence, that there was
                  almost no occurrence of any moment
                  o_
                  consideration,
                
                not so much as the death of some eminent
                  <hi>Prelate,</hi> and the succession of a new; but they
                  gave
                  notice of it unto one another, ending
                  their Letters
                  of congratulation
                  unto the party so advanced:
                  Examples
                  of the which in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
                  Histories
                  are both infinite and obvious. By
                  means
                  of which continual intercourse there
                  was
                  mainteined,
                  not only an
                  Association of the several Churches
                  for their greater
                  strength, nor a Communication only of their
                  Councils
                  for the publick
                  safety, but a Communion also with each other,
                
                as Members
                  of the Mystical Body of our Saviour Christ. And this
                  is
                  that <hi>Optatus</hi> speaks
                  of, when having
                  made
                  a Catalogue of the Bishops
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> from S. <hi>Peter</hi> down unto
                  <hi>Siricius,</hi> who then held
                  that place; or, as his words
                  there are, <hi>Qui noster est Socius,</hi> who
                  was
                  his Partner or Associate in the common Government of the
                  Church: He adds,
                  <hi>Cum quo nobis totus orbis commercio formatarum in
                  una communionis societate concordant,</hi> with
                  whom
                  the whole world doth agree with us in one communion or
                  society,
                  by Letters
                  of intercourse and correspondence. For <hi>Literae
                  formatae,</hi> or <hi>communicatoriae,</hi>
                  were
                  these Letters
                  called,
                  as in the 163 Epistle of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> where both
                  names
                  occur.
              </p>
              <p>
                This as it was
                  the usage of the former times,
                  so was
                  there never more need to uphold the same, than in the
                  latter part of this present Age. So mighty a distemper
                  had
                  possessed
                
                
                the Church, that no part almost of it
                  was
                  in a tolerable constitution: and
                  therefore
                  it concerned
                  the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  to be quick and active, before the
                  maladies
                  thereof became
                  incurable. In that of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  besides
                  the faction raised
                  by <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> which
                  had
                  no countenance from the Church; there
                  was
                  an
                  erroneous doctrine publickly
                  received
                  about the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
                  The Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  besides
                  the heat she fell into concerning
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> was
                  much disquieted
                  by the Heresie
                  of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> broached
                  within the same. And that no sooner
                  was
                  suppressed,
                  or at lest quieted
                  for the present, but a great flame
                  brake
                  out in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which
                  beginning
                  in the House of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> before
                  remembred,
                  had
                  like to have put all the Church into combustion.
                  <hi>Rome</hi> in the mean time was
                  afflicted
                  more than all the rest, by the Schism
                  raised,
                  and the false doctrines
                  preached
                  therein, by <hi>Novatianus:</hi> and that not for a fit
                  only and no more but so, but in a constant kind of
                  sickness, which disturbed
                  her long. In this distemper of the Church, the
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  had
                  no way to consult her health; but by
                  having
                  recourse to their old way of mutual <hi>commerce</hi>
                  and <hi>conference:</hi> which being
                  it could not be performed
                  in <hi>person,</hi> must be done
                  by <hi>Letters.</hi>
                  And so accordingly
                  it was.
                  Witness those several Letters
                  written
                  by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of <hi>Rome: viz.</hi> from him
                  to <hi>Stephanus, Epist.</hi> 71. to <hi>Lucius,
                  Epist.</hi> 58. and to <hi>Cornelius,
                  Epist.</hi> 42, 43, 47, 54, 55, 57. to the Church there,
                  <hi>Epist.</hi> 23, 29. and from the Church of
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of it, unto him
                  again, <hi>Epist.</hi> 31, 46, 48, 49. In all of which
                  they mutually
                  both give and take advice, as the
                  necessities
                  of their affairs,
                  and the condition of the Church
                  required:
                  Nor was
                  the business of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in
                  agitation between <hi>Cyprian</hi> only and the
                  <hi>Roman Prelates;</hi>
                  but taken
                  also into the care and consideration of
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                
                who writ his judgment
                  in it, and advice about it, to <hi>Stephanus</hi> then
                  Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who held
                  against St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or indeed rather for the
                  truth, in the point in question. What the same
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> did,
                  for the suppressing
                  of the faction of <hi>Novatus,</hi>
                  raised
                  in <hi>Rome</hi> at first, but after
                  spreading
                  further over all the Church, we have in part
                  beheld
                  already, by his Epistle unto <hi>Fabius</hi> of
                  <hi>Antiochia</hi> who was
                  suspected
                  to incline that way; and that inscribed
                  unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> written
                  about that business also, which before we
                  spake
                  of. And we may see what <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  did
                  in recompence
                  of that advice and comfort which he
                  had
                  from <hi>Rome,</hi> in his own afflictions,
                  by the great care he took
                  for the composing
                  of her Schisms
                  and troubles
                  when she fell into them;
                  by his Epistles
                  to that only purpose: as <hi>viz.</hi> those unto
                  <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                intituled
                  <hi>Quod ordinationem Novatiani non
                  receperit,
                  De ordinatione
                  ejus  se comprobata, Quod ad Confessores
                   Novatiano seductos literas
                  fecerit:</hi> The Letters
                  of those seduced
                  <hi>Confessors</hi>
                  to him,
                  and his congratulation unto them
                  upon their return to their obedience to the Church;
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> writing
                  unto him
                  touching
                  the faction of <hi>Novatian,</hi> and their wicked
                  practices,
                  with his Reply
                  unto <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Thus also when
                  <hi>Sabellius</hi> began
                  to broach his Heresies
                  within the jurisdiction of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> he
                  did
                  not only signifie
                  the same to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by the
                  Cardinal is
                  used
                  I know not how, for a prime Argument,
                
                to prove the <hi>Popes
                  Supremacy:</hi> but unto divers
                  other Bishops,
                  as before was
                  shewn,
                  to whom
                  assuredly
                  he owed
                  no obedience. This as he did,
                  according
                  to the usage of the Church, at that time in force: so
                  took
                  he other courses
                  also for the suppression of that
                  Heresie,
                  both by power and pen. For finding
                  upon certain information , that
                  diverse Bishops
                  of <hi>Pentapolis,</hi>
                
                being
                  within the <hi>Patriarchat</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  began
                  to countenance and embrace the said
                  desperate doctrines,
                  and had
                  so far prevailed
                  therein, that there was
                  hardly
                  any mention in their Churches
                  of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> he knowing
                  that the care and oversight of the
                  said
                  Churches
                  did
                  belong to him,
                  first laboured
                  by his Messengers
                  and Commissioners
                  to dissuade them
                  from those lewd opinions;
                  and when that would not do the deed, he
                  was
                  constrained
                  to write unto them
                  an
                  Epistle, in which he throughly
                  confuted
                  their erroneous Tenets.
                  By which as we may see the care and piety of this famous
                  <hi>Prelate,</hi> triumphing
                  in the fall of Heresie;
                  so we may see the power and eminency
                  of that famous <hi>See,</hi> having
                  the governance and superintendency of so many
                  Churches.
              </p>
              <p>
                But that which was
                  indeed the greatest
                  business of his time,
                
                and which the Church was
                  most concerned
                  in, was
                  that of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> the
                  sixteenth
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> great in
                  relation to the man,
                
                one of the three prime Bishops
                  in the Christian Church; and great inference to the
                  danger which was
                  like to follow. When one of the main
                  Pillars
                  of a Church is
                  foundred,
                  the whole edifice is
                  in danger of a present ruin. And therefore
                  presently
                  upon the apprehension of the mischief likely
                
                
                
                to ensue, in case there was
                  no speedy course taken
                  to prevent the same, the Bishops
                  of all parts
                  repaired
                  to <hi>Antioch,</hi> not only those which
                  were
                  within the jurisdiction of that <hi>Patriarchate,</hi>
                  but such as lived
                  far off; and in all possibility, might have
                  kept
                  their Churches
                  from the infection of the Heresie,
                  being
                  so remote. For thither came
                  <hi>Firmilianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
                
                in <hi>Cappadocia, Gregory</hi>
                  surnamed
                  <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Neo-Caesarea</hi>
                  in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Athenodorus</hi> his
                  brother, another Bishop of that
                  Province,
                  <hi>Helenus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tarsus, Nicomas</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Iconium, Hymenaeus</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Hierusalem,
                  Maximus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bostra, Theoctecnus</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of
                  <hi>Palestine;</hi>
                  and so many others, , that the
                  number of them
                  was
                  innumerable.
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
                  was
                  required
                  also to be there,
                
                , but he excused
                  himself by reason of his age and weakness. And well
                  indeed he might do so, being
                  then very ill at ease, and dying
                  whilst the Synod was
                  in preparation.
                
                But what he could not do in person, he
                  performed
                  by his Pen: writing
                  not only to the Fathers,
                  who were
                  there assembled,
                  which <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks
                  of; but to the Heretick
                  himself, a Copy of the which we have both in
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> and the <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> as
                  before was
                  said.
                  As for the other <hi>Dionysius</hi> the then Pope of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> I find not any thing that he
                  did,
                  to quench the flame.
                
                For though <hi>Baronius</hi> being
                  sensible how much it might redound to this
                  Popes
                  disgrace, that he alone should be a looker on in so
                  great a business, wherein the honour of our Lord and
                  SAVIOUR was
                  so much concerned;
                  hath
                  fained
                  a Council to be held
                  at <hi>Rome</hi> at the same time, and for the same
                  intent, and purpose; yet there is
                  no such thing in <hi>Athanasius</hi>
                  whom
                  he cites
                  to prove it; neither doth <hi>Binius,</hi>
                  though in other things
                  he takes
                  up much of his Commodities
                  on the Cardinals
                  word, speak the least word of such a Council. It may be
                  that the Popes
                  then being,
                  had
                  so much work cut out at home by the <hi>Novatian</hi>
                  faction there; that they had
                  little leisure to attend a business so remote and
                  distant: which is
                  the best excuse I can see for them.
                  And yet welfare the Cardinal and his <hi>Binius</hi>
                  too. For though the Pope was
                  neither there, nor had
                  so much as sent
                  his Letters
                  for ought we can find; and that the <hi>Synodical
                  Epistle</hi> written
                  by the Fathers,
                
                was
                  inscribed
                  to this <hi>Dionysius Maximus</hi>
                  Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> , and
                  to all other
                  their Colleagues,
                  the Bishops,
                  over all the World, and to the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  and <hi>Deacons,</hi>
                  and the whole Catholick
                  Church,
                
                as the Title runneth:
                  yet they will needs
                  inscribe it to the Pope, none else; <hi>Ad Dionysium
                  Romanum Pontificem scripserunt,</hi> so
                  saith
                  <hi>Binius, Synodicam ad Dionysium Papam scriptam:</hi>
                  So <hi>Baronius</hi> hath
                  it; and both ridiculously
                  false.
              </p>
              <p>
                But to return again unto the Council, the issue of the
                  whole was
                  this; that <hi>Paulus</hi> was
                  deposed
                  from his place and dignity; <hi>Domnus</hi>
                  succeeding
                  in the seat. And whereas
                  <hi>Paulus</hi> notwithstanding his abdication,
                
                still kept
                  possession of his House, , the House
                  belonging
                  to his Bishoprick.
                  as the story hath
                  it: the Emperour
                  <hi>Aurelian,</hi> being
                  made
                  acquainted
                  with it, did
                  determine thus, that it should be
                  delivered
                  unto them,
                  , to whom
                  the Bishops
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> should
                  adjudg
                  the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now in this business there are these two
                  things
                  to be considered;
                
                the man thus sentenced,
                  and those to whom
                  the last part of the Sentence was
                  to be put in execution: both of
                  them
                  yielding
                  matter worthy of our observation, for the present
                  business. For <hi>Paulus</hi> first, the
                  Fathers
                  of the Council laying
                  down the course and passages
                  of his behaviour,
                
                do describe him
                  thus: that being
                  born of mean and ordinary parentage,
                  he had
                  amassed
                  great sums
                  of money, and full heaps
                  of Treasure: which he had
                  gotten
                  by bribery and corruption, from those that
                  were
                  in Suits
                  and differences,
                   and had
                  repaired
                  to him
                  to be righted
                  in their several causes:
                  next, that he never went
                  abroad in publick,
                  but that he was
                  attended
                  by a Cuard; some of them
                  going
                  before him,
                  others following
                  after, to the great scandal of the Gospel: And last of
                  all, that he had
                  caused
                  a <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>State</hi> to be
                  erected
                  for him,
                  not such as did
                  become one of CHRISTS Disciples,
                  but high and lofty, such as the
                  Princes
                  of the World (or rather secular
                  Princes)
                  did
                  use to sit in. Which passages
                  (for I omit the rest that follow, as not
                  conducing
                  to the story which I have in hand) as they do
                  manifestly
                  set forth unto us the extream
                  pride, and base corruptions
                  of the man: so do they also give us no obscure light,
                  whereby we may discern the customs
                  of the Church in these particulars.
              </p>
              <p>
                For first, I find it not objected
                  against <hi>Paulus,</hi> that he
                  did
                  deal sometimes
                  in such Suits
                  and differences,
                  (matters
                  of secular business out of question) as
                  were
                  brought
                  before him:
                
                but that he took
                  bribes,
                  , and received
                
                
                money of such men
                  as came
                  for Justice, and yet abused
                  them
                  too, and did
                  nothing for them.
                  So that it is
                  not faulted
                  by the Fathers,
                  for ought I can see, that he made
                  himself a Judg
                  amongst his brethren, or took
                  upon him
                  to compose such differences,
                  as were
                  brought
                  before him
                  (which certainly
                  was
                  no new matter in these times:)
                  but that he was
                  corrupt and base, not <hi>Ministring,</hi>
                  but <hi>selling
                  Justice</hi> to the People; perhaps not
                  selling
                  Justice neither, but making
                  them
                  pay dearly
                  for an
                  unjust Sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next thing I observe is
                  this, that <hi>Paulus</hi> is
                  not charged
                  by the Synod for being
                  well attended,
                  for having
                  many followers
                  waiting
                  on him,
                  according
                  to the greatness
                  of his place and quality. Their
                  words
                  as in <hi>Eusebius</hi> they are
                  laid
                  before me, will bear no such meaning:
                  though some indeed, to raise an
                  Odium on the <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
                
                do expound it so, as if a great part of his pride and
                  insolency consisted
                  in <hi>that numerous train which
                  attended
                  on him
                  in the Streets.</hi>
                  .
                
                He did
                  not stir abroad without a <hi>Guard,</hi>
                  saith
                  the Original, <hi>Magna satellitum stipatus turba,</hi>
                  saith
                  the Translator of <hi>Eusebius, Cum satellitio
                  publicitus ingrediens,</hi>
                
                as the Translator of <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
                  hath
                  it. Now whether we look upon this passage in the
                  <hi>Greek,</hi> as given
                  us in the word , or in the <hi>Latin
                  Satellitium,</hi> or <hi>Satellitum
                  turba:</hi> I must profess my ignorance to be such in
                  both the Languages,
                  that though I find it charged
                  on <hi>Paulus,</hi> that he was
                  guarded
                  when he went
                  abroad with a <hi>band of Spear-men;</hi>
                  I find it not objected
                  that he was
                  <hi>Attended</hi>
                  by a <hi>Train</hi> of <hi>servants.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Last of all for his <hi>Throne,</hi> the charge
                  consists
                  not as I take it, in the thing it self, for
                  Bishops
                  were
                  allowed
                  their <hi>Thrones</hi>
                  in the Primitive times;
                  but in the raising
                  of it to a greater
                  height than had
                  been
                  accustomed.
                  <hi>Cassiodore,</hi>
                
                I am
                  sure doth expound it so: <hi>Intra Ecclesiam vero
                  tribunal in alto altius quam fuerat extrui, 
                  thronum in excelsioribus
                  collocari jubet, secretarium quoque sterni  parari,
                  sicut judicibus seculi solet.</hi>
                <q>He caused
                  his Tribunal in the Church to be
                  built
                  much higher
                  than it had
                  been
                  formerly,
                  and his Throne to be placed
                  more aloft than before it was,
                  and a Closet also to be trimmed
                  and furnished,
                  as <hi>secular Judges</hi>
                  used
                  to have.</q>
                By which it seemeth,
                  taking
                  the Authors
                  words
                  as they lie together,
                
                that it was
                  not the Throne but  the state and
                  exaltation of the Throne, that gave
                  the scandal. A Throne he might have
                  had,
                  , as other <hi>Bishops
                  Christs</hi> Disciples
                  used
                  to have before.
                  But he would have his Throne <hi>exalted,</hi>
                  adorned
                  and furnished
                  like a Closet, , after the manner of
                  Kings
                  and Princes:
                  Or if the Seat or <hi>Throne</hi> here
                  spoken
                  of, were
                  a <hi>Tribunal,</hi> as it is
                  said
                  by <hi>Cassiodore;</hi> we must not look upon
                  him
                  in the Church, but in the <hi>Consistory:</hi> in which
                  he would have nothing ordinary
                  like to other Bishops,
                  but all things
                  suted
                  and adorned
                  like the <hi>Bench</hi> or Judgment-seat
                  of a Civil Magistrate.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the men
                  to whom
                  the execution of the Sentence was
                  committed,
                
                which is
                  the next thing here to be considered,
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells
                  us that they were
                  the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> And
                  possibly
                  the Emperour
                  might commit the judgment
                  of the cause to them,
                  because being
                  strangers
                  to the place, and by reason of their absence not
                  ingaged
                  in the business, or known
                  to either of the two <hi>Pretenders;</hi>
                  they might with greater
                  equity and indifference, determine in it. This
                  is
                  more like to be the reason, than that the
                  Emperour
                  should take such notice of the Popes
                  authority, as to conceive the Judgments
                  and Decrees
                  of other Bishops
                  to be no further good and valid, <hi>quam eas authoritas
                  Romani Pontificis confirmasset,</hi>
                
                than as they were
                  confirmed
                  by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as fain the Cardinal
                  would have it. If so, what needed
                  the <hi>Italian Bishops</hi>
                  to be joyned
                  with him?
                  The Pope might do it of himself without their
                  advice,
                  indeed without the Emperours
                  Authority. This was
                  not then the matter, whatsoever
                  was;
                  and what was
                  like to be the matter we have said
                  already. And more than that I need not say, as to the
                  reason of the reference, why the
                  Emperour
                  made
                  choice rather of the <hi>Western</hi> than the
                  <hi>Eastern Bishops</hi>
                  to cognisance the cause, and give possession on the same
                  accordingly.
                  But there is
                  something else to be considered,
                  as to the matter of the reference to the point
                  referred;
                  as also to the persons
                  who by this Sovereign Authority
                  were
                  enabled
                  to determine in the cause proposed.
              </p>
              <p>
                And first as for the point referred,
                  whereas there were
                  two things
                  considerable in the whole proceedings
                  against <hi>Paulus; viz.</hi> his dangerous and
                  heretical Doctrine, and next his violent and unjust
                  possession: the first had
                  been
                  adjudged
                  before in the Council, and he deposed
                  for the same. With that the Bishops
                  either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi>
                  had
                  no more to do, than to subscribe unto the
                  judgment
                  of the Synod: or being
                
                
                
                being
                  a matter meerly
                  of spiritual cognizance, might in a like Synodical
                  meeting,
                  without the
                  Emperors
                  Authority as their case then stood,
                  have censured
                  and condemned
                  the Heresie,
                  though with his person possibly
                  they could not meddle, as being
                  of another
                  Patriarchat. But that which here I find
                  referred
                  unto them,
                  was
                  a mere <hi>Lay-fee,</hi> a point of title and
                  possession, and it was
                  left unto them
                  to determine in it, whether the Plaintiff or Defendant
                  had
                  the better right to the house in question. This
                  was
                  the point in issue between the parties,
                  and they upon the hearing
                  of the cause, gave
                  sentence
                  in behalf of <hi>Domnus;</hi> who
                  presently
                  upon the said
                  award or sentence, was
                  put into possession of the house, and the force
                  removed
                  by the appointment of the Emperour.
                  And it is
                  worth our notice also, that as they
                  did
                  not thrust themselves into the imployment,
                  being
                  a matter meerly
                  of a secular nature: so when the Emperor
                  required
                  their advice therein, or if you will make
                  them
                  his Delegates
                  and High Commissioners;
                  they neither did
                  delay or dispute the matter, nor
                  pleaded
                  any Ancient Canons,
                  by which they might pretend to be
                  disabled
                  from intermedling
                  in the same. A thing which questionless some one or
                  other of them
                  would have done,
                  there being
                  so many Godly and Religious Prelates
                  interessed
                  therein, had
                  they conceived
                  that the imployment
                  had
                  been
                  inconsistent with their holy calling.
              </p>
              <p>
                A second thing to be considered
                  in this delegation,
                
                concerns
                  the parties
                  unto whom
                  it was
                  committed,
                  which were
                  as hath
                  been
                  said
                  before, the Bishops
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> In
                  which it will not be impertinent to examine
                  briefly
                  why the Bishops
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                
                and the Bishops
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> , as by
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> it is
                  given
                  us in the plural number, should be here
                  reckoned
                  as distinct, since both the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  was
                  within the limits
                  and bounds
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> subordinate, or
                  rather subject to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                the Queen and Empress of the World. For resolution of
                  which <hi>Quaere,</hi> we may please to know that in the
                  distribution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the continent
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi> together with the Isles
                  adjoyning
                  was
                  divided
                  into two parts,
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Prefecture</hi> of the City of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> conteining
                  <hi>Latium, Tuscia,</hi> and <hi>Picenum,</hi> the Realm
                  of <hi>Naples,</hi>
                
                and the three Islands
                  of <hi>Sicily, Corsica,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> as
                  before was
                  said,
                  the head City or Metropolis of the which
                  was
                  the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                And secondly,
                  the Diocess
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> containing
                  all the <hi>Western</hi> and broader
                  part thereof
                  from the River <hi>Magra</hi> to the
                  <hi>Alpes,</hi>
                  in which were
                  comprehended
                  seven other Provinces,
                  and of the which the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> or prime City
                  was
                  that of <hi>Millain,</hi>
                  , as in <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
                
                So that that Church being
                  in the Common-wealth, according
                  to that maxim of <hi>Optatus,</hi> and
                  following
                  the pattern of the same, in the proportion and
                  fabrick
                  of her publick
                  Government, the Bishops
                  of the Diocess
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> were
                  no way under the command of the Patriarch or Primate of
                  the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of their own Primate
                  only, which was
                  he of <hi>Millain.</hi>
                  And this division seems
                  to be of force in the times
                  we speak of, because that in the
                  subscriptions
                  to the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi>
                
                being
                  about 40 years
                  after that of <hi>Antioch;</hi> the
                  Bishops
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> stand divided
                  into two ranks
                  or Provinces,
                  that is
                  to say <hi>Provincia Italiae,</hi> and <hi>Provincia
                  Romana,</hi>
                  the Province of <hi>Italy,</hi> of which
                  <hi>Orosius</hi> the Metropolitan of
                  <hi>Millain</hi>
                  subscribeth
                  only, and then the Province of the City of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> for which <hi>Gregorius</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Porto</hi> subscribeth
                  first. In after Ages
                  the distinction is
                  both clear and frequent, as in the Epistle of the
                  Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> extant in
                  <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                
                and an
                  Epistle of the said
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi>
                  written
                  unto others. So that according
                  to the Premisses
                  this conclusion followeth,
                  that the Popes
                  or Patriarchs
                  of <hi>Rome</hi> had
                  no Authority in the Church more than other
                  Primates,
                  no not in <hi>Italy</hi> it self, more than the
                  Metropolitan of <hi>Millain,</hi>
                  as may appear, should all proofs
                  else be wanting
                  by this place and passage, by which the
                  Bishops
                  of the Diocess
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> (taking
                  the word Diocess
                  in its
                  civil sense) were
                  put into a joynt
                  commission, with the Bishops
                  of the Patriarchat of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pope
                  himself. Which tending
                  so expresly
                  to the overthrow of the Popes
                  Supremacy, as well <hi>Christopherson</hi>
                  in his Translation of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as the great
                  Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Application of the
                  place, are fain to falsifie
                  their Author. For whereas in the Text we have that he of
                  the Petenders was
                  to have possession, , to
                  whom
                  the Bishops
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                
                and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> should adjudge the same:
                  <hi>Christopherson</hi> translates
                  it thus, <hi>Quibus Christiani Italiae  Urbis Romae
                  Episcopi tribuenda praescriberent; Baronius</hi> with
                  less ambiguity, <hi>Cui Italiae Christiani,  Urbis
                  Romanae Episcopi
                  dandam praescriberent;</hi> to whom
                  the Christians
                  of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Bishops
                  of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> should think fit to give
                  it. And for a further testimony of this equality betwixt
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi>
                  we may note also on the by, that each Church
                  had
                  its
                  proper and peculiar customs;
                  <hi>Rome</hi> neither giving
                  Law to <hi>Millain,</hi>
                  nor she to <hi>Rome.</hi> Witness
                
                
                that signal difference betwixt them
                  in the <hi>Saturdays</hi>
                  fast, which in those times
                  was
                  kept
                  at <hi>Rome,</hi> but not at <hi>Millain;</hi>
                  according
                  to that memorable saying
                  of Saint <hi>Ambrose, quando Romae sum, jejuno Sabbato;
                  quando hic sum, non jejuno Sabbato:</hi>
                
                Indeed the
                  Church of <hi>Millain</hi>
                  might well stand on her own <hi>Prerogatives,</hi>
                  as being
                  little inferiour
                  unto that of <hi>Rome,</hi> either in the condition of
                  her founder, or the Antiquity of her foundation: S.
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apostle being
                  generally
                  reported
                  for the first Bishop here, to whom
                  <hi>Anathalon</hi> succeeded,
                  <hi>Gaius</hi> after him,
                
                and so successively
                  Bishop after Bishop, till these very
                  times.
                  Thus having
                  prosecuted
                  the affairs
                  of this second <hi>Century</hi> from the Church of
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> unto that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  from thence to <hi>Antioch;</hi> and on occasion of
                  <hi>Samosatenus</hi> Bishop of this last,
                  being
                  forced
                  to take a journey over unto <hi>Rome</hi> and
                  <hi>Italy,</hi> we will next look on the condition of
                  these <hi>Western</hi> Churches,
                  and the estate wherein Episcopacy
                  stood
                  amongst them
                  for this present Age.

                  at last to the <hi>Western</hi>
                  Churches,
                
                the first we meet withal is
                  <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  who lived
                  in the conclusion of the second <hi>Century,</hi> and
                  the beginning
                  of the third; to whom
                  succeeded
                  <hi>Zephyrinus,</hi>
                
                who by <hi>Optatus</hi> is
                  entituled
                  <hi>Urbicus,</hi> or the City-Bishop; the stile of
                  <hi>Oecumenicaal</hi> or <hi>Universal,</hi>
                  being
                  then unknown. Of him
                  it is
                  affirmed
                  by <hi>Platina, Mandasse ne Episcopus vel 
                  Patriarcha vel Primate, vel  Metropolitano suo
                  in judicium vocatus, sine authoritate Apostolica
                  damnaretur;</hi>
                  how he decreed
                  that no Bishop being
                  called
                  in question, either by Patriarch,
                  Primate,
                  or Metropolitan, should be condemned
                  without the leave and liking
                  of the See Apostolick;
                  that is
                  to say, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Author
                  means
                  it. A matter fit enough indeed for
                  an
                  <hi>Oecumenical,</hi>
                  but of too high a nature for a City-Bishop to
                  attempt or
                  think of. And therefore I desire to be
                  excused
                  of <hi>Platina,</hi> if I believe neither his report,
                  nor the Epistles
                  Decretal ascribed
                  unto <hi>Zephyrinus,</hi> on which the
                  said
                  report
                  was
                  founded.
                  Sure I am
                  <hi>Damasus</hi> in the <hi>Pontifical</hi>
                  tells
                  us no such matter.
                
                And no less sure I am
                  that the practice of the Church
                  was
                  contrary for a long time after: Saint
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> being
                  then Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                  deposing
                  thirteen Bishops
                  in one Visitation, whom
                  he had
                  found unworthy of so high a calling,
                  without consulting
                  with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
                  fearing
                  that his acts
                  might have been
                  repealed
                  by the Popes
                  thereof. Nor can that strange report of <hi>Platina</hi>
                  consist, if looked
                  on with indifferent eyes,
                  either with the condition of the
                  times
                  of which he writeth,
                  in which the Popes
                  had
                  hardly
                  meditated
                  on their future greatness; or with the
                  Constitutions
                  of the
                
                
                
                Church, by which the Primate in each
                  Diocess
                  had
                  the <hi>dernier resort,</hi> as the
                  Lawyers
                  phrase it, there being
                  regularly
                  no Appeal from him
                  but only to a general Council. Which Constitution of the
                  Church, as it was
                  afterwards
                  confirmed
                  by the great Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
                
                so was
                  it finally
                  established
                  by the Laws
                  Imperial, whereof consult
                  <hi>Novel. Constitut.</hi> 123. <hi>c.</hi> 22. More
                  likely is
                  that other Ordinance or Decree ascribed
                  to <hi>Zepherinus</hi> by this Author,
                
                <hi>ut astantibus Clericis  Laicis fidelibus, 
                  levita  sacerdos ordinaretur,</hi> that
                  Priests
                  and Deacons
                  should be ordained
                  in the presence of the Clergy, and other of
                  Gods
                  faithful people; in which, as he
                  is
                  backed
                  by <hi>Damasus,</hi> who affirms
                  the same: So is
                  the truth or probability thereof, at least
                  confirmed
                  by the following
                  practice. Where note, that in the Ordination of these
                  Priests
                  and Deacons
                  there is
                  not any thing required
                  but the peoples
                  presence, <hi>adstantibus Laicis,</hi> as that Author
                  hath
                  it; the Church being
                  never so obliged
                  unto the votes
                  and suffrages
                  of the people, but that the Bishop might ordain fit
                  Ministers
                  without requiring
                  their consent,
                  though on the reasons
                  formerly
                  delivered
                  it was
                  thought fit that Ordinations
                  should be made
                  in publick,
                  as well the People as the Clergy
                  being
                  present at them.

              <p>
                The seventh
                  from <hi>Zepherinus</hi> was
                  <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                by birth a <hi>Roman,</hi> elected
                  to that place and ministery,
                
                <hi>Coepiscoporum testimonio,</hi> by the consent and
                  suffrage of his <hi>Com- Provincials,</hi>
                  as also by the voices
                  of the Clergy, <hi> Plebis quae tunc adfuit
                  suffragio,</hi> and with the liking
                  of the people, or as many of them
                  as did
                  attend at the Election; the number of the
                  Bishops
                  there Assembled
                  being
                  sixteen in all,
                
                as by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is
                  recorded.
                  Which as it was
                  the manner of Electing,
                  not only of the Bishops
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of most Bishops
                  else,
                
                in the times
                  we speak of, so it continued
                  long in use; the voices
                  of the Clergy in the point and substance, the presence
                  and approbation of the people for the form and ceremony,
                  <hi>electio Clericorum,</hi> and <hi>testimonia
                  populorum,</hi> being
                  joyned
                  together by Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> Now the condition of the
                  Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under this <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                  besides
                  the Schism raised
                  in it by <hi>Novatianus,</hi> of which more anon,
                  is
                  to be seen
                  most fully
                  in a Letter of his to <hi>Fabius</hi> Patriarch of
                  <hi>Antiochia;</hi>
                
                in which he certifieth
                  him
                  that besides
                  the Bishop, , who
                  was
                  but one in every Church, and could not be more, there
                  were
                  forty-six Presbyters,
                  seven Deacons,
                  and Sub-Deacons
                  seven; forty-two Acolythites, Exorcists,
                  Readers,
                  Sextons,
                  <hi>(Ostiarij)</hi> fifty-two in all;
                  Widows
                  and other poor People, pressed
                  with want and sickness, fifteen hundred,
                  : All which,
                  saith
                  he, are maintained
                  at the publick
                  charge by the grace and bounty of the Lord. Out of which
                  place and passage of my Author there are these several
                  points
                  to be considered
                  in reference to our present business. First, the
                  exceeding
                  large revenue of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in these
                  early days,
                  so great as to maintain the numbers
                  before specified,
                  according
                  to the rank and quality of each particular; the
                  distribution of the which did
                  ordinarily,
                  and of common course belong unto the Bishop only, or
                  such to whom
                  he pleased
                  to entrust the same. And secondly,
                  we may observe the singularity of
                  succession,
                  wherein the Bishop differed
                  from the other Clergy; he being
                  but one, they many in their ranks
                  and stations,
                  sometimes
                  more, sometimes
                  fewer,
                  according
                  to the greatness of the Church in which they
                  served,
                  and the emergent necessities
                  and occasions
                  of it. Here in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to one only
                  Bishop we find a Clergy of inferior
                  Ministers
                  consisting
                  of 154 persons;
                  which doubtless was
                  exceedingly
                  increased
                  in the following
                  times;
                
                <hi>Hierom</hi> complaining
                  in his time, <hi>Presbyteros turbam
                  contemptibiles
                  facere,</hi> that the great number of
                  them
                  made
                  them
                  be the less regarded.
                  And last of all, we may observe, that though
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> mentioneth
                  <hi>Acolythites, Readers,
                  Sub-Deacons,
                  Exorcists,</hi>
                  and <hi>Sextons;</hi>
                  these are not to be reckoned
                  as distinct Orders
                  in the Church, although now so accounted
                  in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but only several
                  services
                  and imployments
                  which were
                  required
                  in the same. Concerning
                  which, take here the learned
                  resolution of judicious <hi>Hooker.</hi>
                
                <hi>There is
                  an
                  error,</hi> saith
                  he, <hi>which beguileth
                  many, who much intangle
                  both themselves and others by not
                  distinguishing
                  Services,
                  Offices,
                  and Orders
                  Ecclesiastical; the first of which three, and in part
                  the second may be executed
                  by the Laity, whereas none have or can have the third
                  but the Clergy. Catechists,
                  Exorcists,
                  Readers,
                  Singers,
                  and the rest of like sort, if the nature only of their
                  labour and pains
                  be considered,
                  may in that respect seem</hi> Clergy-men,
                  <hi>even as the Fathers
                  for that cause term them
                  usually
                  Clerks;
                  as also in regard of the end whereunto they
                  were
                  trained
                  up, which was
                  to be ordered
                  or ordained
                  when years
                  and experience should make them
                  able. Notwithstanding, in as much as they no way
                  differed
                  from others of the Laity longer
                  than during that work of Service, which at any time they
                  might give over, being
                  thereunto but admitted,
                  not tied
                  by irrevocable Ordination,
                  we find them
                  always
                  exactly
                  severed
                  from that body, whereof those three before
                  rehearsed
                
                
                Orders
                  of Bishops,
                  Presbyters,
                  and Deacons
                  only are, the natural parts.</hi>
                  So the judicious Divine indeed, as one
                  truly
                  calls
                  him.
                  I add this further of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                having
                  thus fallen
                  upon the Orders
                  in the state Ecclesiastick,
                  that he had
                  passed
                  through all inferior
                  Offices,
                  <hi>per omnia Ecclesiastica officia promotus,</hi> as
                  Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath
                  it,
                
                and exercised
                  each several Ministery
                  in the Church of God, before he
                  mounted
                  to this height, <hi>ad Sacerdotij
                  sublime fastigium,</hi> are the
                  Fathers
                  words;
                  which shewed
                  that the estate of Bishops
                  was
                  as a different office, so an
                  higher
                  dignity than any other in the Church.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now as the speech of Heaven doth many
                  times
                  put us in mind of Hell,
                
                so this relation
                  of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> an
                  holy Bishop and a Martyr, occasioneth
                  me to speak of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> in
                  whom
                  it is
                  not easie
                  to determine whether the Heretick
                  or the Schismatick
                  had
                  the most predominancy. Certain it
                  is,
                  he proved
                  in both respects
                  one of the cunningest
                  instruments
                  of Satan, for the disturbance of the Church, who
                  suffered
                  most extreamly
                  by him
                  both in peace and truth; the Schism or
                  Heresie
                  by him
                  raised
                  at this very time, being
                  both more suddain
                  in the growth, and permanent in the duration of it, than
                  ever had
                  been
                  set on foot before in the Church of Christ. Now this
                  <hi>Novatianus</hi> was
                  a Presbyter
                  of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
                  being
                  much offended,
                  as well at the Election of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as that
                  himself was
                  pretermitted
                  in the choice, associates
                  himself with one <hi>Novatus</hi>
                  an
                  <hi>African</hi> Bishop, as near unto
                  him
                  in conditions,
                  as he was
                  in name, whom
                  <hi>Cyprian, omnium sacerdotum voce,</hi>
                
                by the consent and suffrages
                  of all his Comprovincial Bishops
                  had
                  before condemned.
                  By them
                  it was
                  agreed
                  that <hi>Novatianus</hi> should take upon himself the
                  name and title of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
                  being
                  there could be no shew
                  nor colour for it, did
                  he not first receive Episcopal Consecration from some
                  hands
                  or other, they sent
                  unto the obscurest
                  parts
                  of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                
                , as my Author
                  hath
                  it, to find out three poor Countrey
                  Bishops
                  that had
                  not been
                  acquainted
                  with the like affairs.
                  Who being
                  come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and circumvented
                  by the Arts
                  of these wicked men,
                  and partly also forced
                  by their threats
                  and menaces,
                  , they Ordained
                  him
                  Bishop; if at the least an
                  Act so void and <hi>null</hi> from the
                  beginning,
                  may be called
                  an
                  Ordination. And this being
                  done,
                  because they found that people naturally
                  are inclined
                  to imbrace
                  new fancies,
                  especially
                  where pretence of piety seems
                  to bear a stroke, they took
                  upon them
                  to be very strict in their conversation, precise in
                  their opinions,
                  and wonderfully
                  devout in
                  all their carriage; raising
                  withal this doctrine suitable thereto, That such as fell
                  in time of Persecution, though they
                  repented
                  never so truly,
                  and did
                  what ever was
                  thought necessary to testifie
                  their grief and sorrow for their great offence, yet
                  , there was
                  no hope of their salvation,
                
                no mercy to be looked
                  for at the hands
                  of God. By means
                  whereof they drew
                  unto their side some Confessors,
                  as they called
                  them
                  then, who being
                  well persuaded
                  of their own safestanding,
                  and perhaps having
                  suffered
                  much in testimony of their perseverance,
                  became
                  the worse opinionated
                  of those who had
                  not been
                  endued
                  with an
                  equal constancy.
                  So that upon a sudden, unawares, the Church of
                  <hi>Rome</hi> was
                  in a very great distemper; the neighbouring
                  Churches
                  also suffering
                  with it, either in regard of their own peace, which
                  presently
                  began
                  to be endangered
                  by this plausible and popular faction, or out of
                  commiseration unto the distresses
                  of so great a number in the body mystical. Nor
                  was
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> wanting
                  to the Church, or the Church to
                  him.
                  For presently
                  upon the breaking
                  out of the flame, he gives
                  notice of it to his dear Brother and Colleague, S.
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Carthage</hi>
                  to <hi>Fabius,</hi>
                
                Patriarch of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  acquainting
                  them
                  with the whole story of the business;
                  assembling
                  also , a great and famous Synod in
                  the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> consisting
                  of sixty Bishops,
                  and as many Presbyters
                  or more, besides
                  Deacons.
                  For being
                  a Provincial Council, and not General, the
                  Presbyters
                  and others of the inferiour
                  Clergy had
                  their Votes
                  therein, according
                  as they still enjoy on the like
                  occasions.
                  And on the other side, the Orthodox and
                  Catholick
                  Bishops
                  made
                  the cause their own; neither repelling
                  of his Agents,
                  who came
                  to justifie
                  his Ordination, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  did,
                
                or writing
                  in behalf of the Church against
                  him,
                  as did
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the Learned
                  and renowned
                  Bishop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The like no doubt
                  did
                  other Bishops.
                  And more than so, they caused
                  several Councils
                  to be called
                  about it, , in their several
                  Provinces
                  and charges,
                  as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as <hi>Africk;</hi>
                  in each of which, the faction was
                  condemned,
                  and the Arch-Schismatick,
                  with all his Fautors, deprived
                  of the communion
                  of the Church.
              </p>
              
              
              
              <p>
                I have the rather been
                  more copious in the description of this Schism, and the
                  Authors
                  of it, than otherwise I would have
                  been,
                  not only because of that great power and influence which
                  it had
                  after in the Church, which we shall find hereafter in
                  the prosecution of this present story, if it please God
                  to give me means
                  and opportunity, to go thorow
                  with it: but also for those many
                  observations
                  which any one that would be curious in
                  collecting
                  them,
                  might raise or gather from the same, For first of all it
                  must be noted,
                  that though <hi>Novatianus</hi>
                  had
                  a great desire to be made
                  a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that he could not get it by a
                  fair orderly Election, as he should have
                  done:
                  yet he could find no other entrance thereunto, than by
                  the door of <hi>Ordination;</hi> and therein he would be
                  <hi>Canonical,</hi> though in nothing else. For
                  being
                  a Presbyter before, as <hi>Cornelius</hi>
                  tells
                  us in his Epistle unto <hi>Fabius</hi>
                   (saith
                  that holy <hi>Prelate:</hi>
                
                ) he thought that did
                  not qualifie
                  him
                  enough for the place and office of a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
                  unless he might receive <hi>Episcopal Ordination</hi>
                  also. And when he was
                  resolved
                  on that, he would not be ordained
                  but by three <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  at the least, according
                  to the ancient <hi>Canon,</hi> and the present practice
                  of the Church; and therefore , he
                  procures
                  three <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  to be drawn
                  together for the purpose. And being
                  thus Ordained,
                  he sends
                  abroad his Agents
                  into foreign Churches,
                
                as <hi>viz. Maximus</hi> a <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
                  and <hi>Augendus</hi> a <hi>Deacon, Macheus</hi> and
                  <hi>Longinus,</hi> and perhaps some others to the See of
                  <hi>Carthage;</hi> to have his Ordination
                  ratified,
                  and himself acknwledged for a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
                  according
                  to the commendable usage of those watchful
                  times.
                  In which, who would not but observe, that
                  <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  had
                  a different Ordination from the
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  and therefore do not differ from
                  them
                  only in degree, or <hi>potestate Jurisdictionis,</hi>
                  but in the power of Order also: and that this power of
                  Order cannot be conferred,
                  regularly
                  I mean, and when there is
                  no urgent and unavoidable necessity unto the
                  contrary,
                  but by the joint assistance of three
                  <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  For how can any give that power of Order unto others,
                  with which they never were
                  endued
                  themselves? Secondly,
                  it might be observed
                  (not to take notice of his seeking
                  for the approbation of his neighbouring
                  <hi>Prelates</hi>)
                  that the first Schism, which did
                  disturb the peace of these <hi>Western</hi>
                  Churches,
                  was
                  made
                  by those, who by the rigidness of their Profession,
                  were
                  in that very instant termed
                  <hi>Catharists,</hi>
                
                , as that Author
                  hath
                  it; and that not to be Englished
                  in a fuller Word, than that of <hi>Puritans.</hi>
                  And thirdly,
                  that however in these later
                  times,
                  the Scene be changed,
                  and that the greatest
                  stirrs
                  that have been
                  raised
                  in the Church, have been
                  for pulling
                  down <hi>Bishops;</hi>
                  yet in the former times,
                  the course was
                  otherwise; most of their troubles
                  and commotions,
                  being
                  for setting
                  up of <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  when certain factious and unquiet
                  spirits,
                  not willing to submit to the Chuches Government, would
                  have a Bishop of their own. Certain I
                  am,
                  that thus it was
                  with the <hi>Novatians;</hi>
                  who though they stood
                  divided
                  from the Catholick
                  Church a long time together, yet they
                  desired
                  to be accounted
                  for a Church: and that they might be so
                  accounted,
                  maintained
                  an
                  Episcopal Succession
                  from the first Apostle of their Sect;
                
                the names
                  of many of their Bishops,
                  <hi>Agellius,
                  Sisinnius, Marcianus,</hi> others
                  being
                  to be found upon good record.
              </p>
              <p>
                But from these counterfeit and schismatical
                  Bishops,
                
                proceed we forwards
                  unto those, who were
                  acknowledged
                  by the Church for true and real: and amongst those,
                  keeping
                  my self to the succession of the Church of
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> the fourth in order from
                  <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                
                was
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who entred
                  on that weighty charge, <hi>Anno</hi> 261. Of
                  him
                  we find in the <hi>Pontifical, Presbyteris Ecclesias
                  divisisse,  coemeteria, Parochiasque 
                  dioeceses
                  constituisse;</hi> that he divided
                  to the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  their several Churches,
                  and Churchyards,
                  and that he first did
                  set out Parishes,
                  and apportioned
                  Diocesses.
                  Which as they were
                  two several Actions
                  so <hi>Platina,</hi>
                
                assigns
                  each action to its
                  proper place: making
                  the first, which was
                  the distributing
                  of the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  into their several Churches,
                  and Churchyards,
                  then common places
                  of Assembly,
                  to relate only to the City of <hi>Rome. In urbe Roma
                  statim divisit,</hi> as his words
                  there are. Which being
                  it had
                  been
                  done
                  before by Pope <hi>Euaristus,</hi>
                  as hath
                  been
                  formerly
                  observed,
                  we must resolve
                  it with <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                
                that this was
                  a reviver only of the former Act: and that the
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  being
                  ravished
                  from their Churches,
                  and the Church-yards
                  taken
                  from the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  during the persecution of <hi>Valerian;</hi>
                  were
                  afterwards
                  restored
                  again to their former state by the Authority of
                  <hi>Dionysius.</hi> In other places,
                  and perhaps here also, this was
                  not done
                  by the Authority, but in the time of <hi>Dionysius;</hi>
                  the Order, or Authority proceeding
                  from an
                  higher
                  hand,
                
                even from the Emperour
                  <hi>Gallienus:</hi> who did
                  not only prohibit the persecution
                  raised
                  by his Father <hi>Valerianus,</hi> but also
                  did
                  permit by
                  his publick
                  Edict, <hi>ut Christiani loca coemeteriorum suorum
                  recigerent,</hi> as by <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
                
                
                it is
                  related.
                  And for the other part of the Relation, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  the setting
                  out of Parishes,
                  and the apportioning
                  of Diocesses;
                  that <hi>Platina</hi> refers
                  unto the Countrey,
                  unto the parts
                  and Provinces
                  abroad, <hi>Parochias  Dioeceses
                  foris distribuit;</hi>
                
                so he tells
                  us there: adding
                  withal, <hi>quo quisque finibus suis, limitibusque
                  contentus esset,</hi> that this
                  was
                  done,
                  that every Bishop might contein
                  himself within the limits
                  of his Diocess,
                  and every Presbyter be confined
                  to his proper Parish. And this as <hi>Dionysius</hi>
                  did
                  within the
                  limits
                  and precincts
                  of his jurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that
                  is
                  to say, the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> (for
                  it were
                  vain to think that he could do the like over all the
                  World, being
                  beyond the sphere of his activity:) so other
                  <hi>Primates,</hi>
                  seeing
                  the conveniency and ease which redounded
                  by it to the Church, might and did
                  also do the like within their Commands.
                  Concerning
                  which, it is
                  to be remembred,
                  that as the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  in each City had
                  a Civil Magistrate, called
                  a <hi>Defensor Civitatis,</hi> who
                  was
                  to do justice for, and in the name of the
                  <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> not only in the City it self, but
                  also unto all the Towns
                  and Villages
                  within the Territory of the same: so in each City, there
                  had
                  been
                  placed
                  a Bishop in the former times,
                  who was
                  not only to take care of the Church of God, within the
                  walls
                  and circuit of that City, but also of the
                  parts
                  adjoyning,
                  accordingly,
                  as they were
                  gained
                  to the faith of Christ. And then the
                  substance
                  of the <hi>Institution,</hi> will be
                  briefly
                  this, that when the faith had
                  spread it self in the Countrey
                  Villages,
                  and that it was
                  too cumbersom
                  a work for the City-Presbyters,
                  to repair thither upon all occasions:
                  it was
                  thought fit by <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and
                  afterwards
                  by other Primates
                  following
                  the Example, that every Countrey
                  Town and Village
                  which had
                  received
                  the faith of Christ, should be furnished
                  with its
                  proper Presbyter;
                  and that the Presbyters
                  so setled
                  and dispersed
                  in the Countrey
                  Villages,
                  should be responsible to the Bishop of that City, within
                  the Territory of the which, the
                  said
                  Village stood.
                  Which distribution of the Church into those
                  smaller
                  portions,
                  and particular Congregations,
                  as we now call <hi>Parishes;</hi>
                  so the Collection of these Parishes
                  into one united
                  body, under one Pastor or chief
                  Governour,
                  which was
                  the Bishop of the City, we do call a
                  <hi>Diocess:</hi>
                  borrowing
                  the names
                  of both from the Ancient Writers,
                  in whom
                  the same are very frequent; and frequent also in the
                  sense, in which now we use them,
                  specially
                  in those Authors,
                  and Synodical Acts,
                  which did
                  succeed the times
                  we speak of.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Tis true, the words
                  being
                  used
                  otherwise in the Ancient Writers,
                
                such of them
                  chiefly,
                  as relate unto us the occurrences
                  of the former times,
                  have given
                  some men
                  occasion to conceive that there
                  was
                  never any <hi>Bishop</hi> in the Primitive Church, but a
                  <hi>Parish-bishop, viz.</hi> the <hi>Rector</hi> of each
                  several Congregation, to whom
                  the cure of Souls
                  is
                  trusted;
                  because they find that in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the
                  Churches
                  of <hi>Jerusalem, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  are called
                  <hi>Paroeciae:</hi> and that there
                  were
                  no <hi>Diocesses,</hi>
                  nor <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops
                  in the purest
                  times,
                  because they find them
                  not so called
                  in those Ancient Writers.
                  For satisfying
                  of which doubt, it is
                  first confessed,
                  that by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the Churches
                  of <hi>Jerusalem, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  as also of <hi>Corinth, Ephesus, Lyons, Carthage,</hi>
                
                and many other famous Cities,
                  are called
                  , or <hi>Paroeciae:</hi> There
                  is
                  no doubt at all of that. But then it
                  is
                  to be confessed,
                  that , in that Author,
                  is
                  never used
                  to signifie
                  a <hi>Countrey-parish,</hi>
                  or a sole Congregation only, which we call a
                  <hi>Parish:</hi> but for the whole City, with the
                  Suburbs
                  and adjoyning
                  Villages,
                  within the circuit of the which,
                  were
                  many Congregations,
                  and material Churches.
                  The very composition
                  of the word doth import no less, the
                  , of a City,
                  containing
                  not alone the Citizens,
                  but all such Borderers
                  and Strangers
                  as dwelt
                  near, or repaired
                  to any chief Church or City, for
                  Gods
                  publick
                  Worship; as our learned
                  <hi>Bilson</hi> doth observe,
                
                comprizing
                  not the City only, <hi>but the Towns
                  and Villages
                  near the City,</hi> as Master <hi>Brerewood</hi>
                  also noteth.
                  And this may be made
                  good even from <hi>Eusebius</hi> himself, so often
                  cited
                  to the contrary, who having
                  said
                  that <hi>Laetus</hi> was
                  <hi>President</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the rest
                  of <hi>Egypt,</hi> adds
                  next, , but the inspection,
                
                or superintendency of the <hi>Paroeciae,</hi> or
                  Churches
                  there, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> had
                  of late received:
                  So that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> being
                  Bishop of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  , as he after
                  calls
                  him,
                  was
                  not the Bishop of a Parish only,
                
                or of the Congregations
                  in the City only; but , of all the
                  Churches
                  throughout <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and those
                  parts
                  of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                
                which were
                  under the command of <hi>Laetus,</hi> for their Civil
                  Government.
              </p>
              <p>
                And lest it may be thought, that the word
                  being
                  , in the plural
                  number, may
                  bear a different construction, from what it doth,
                  being
                  used
                  in the singular: the same <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  tells
                  us of the same <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
                
                that he was
                  ,
                
                
                
                the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Paroecia,</hi> or Church
                  of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereas at that time there
                  were
                  many Parish-Churches,
                  as we now call <hi>Parishes,</hi>
                  within the circuit of that City; as doth appear by
                  <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                
                who doth not only shew
                  the names
                  of many of them,
                  but tells
                  us also who officiated
                  in the same, as Presbyters.
                  So that the word <hi>Paroecia,</hi> in
                  its
                  first and primitive acception, signified
                  not a <hi>Parish,</hi> but a <hi>Diocess;</hi>
                  nor only the Cathedral, but all other
                  Churches,
                  how near or far soever situated,
                  within the Rule and Government of a Bishop. But for the
                  sense, in which we use it in our Age, it
                  gained
                  it not but by degrees,
                  after this division made
                  by <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and that the
                  Countrey
                  Churches
                  grew
                  to be considerable for their means
                  and numbers.
                  And in this sense,
                
                we find it used
                  in the Fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where we
                  find mention of these Presbyters
                  which did
                  <hi>Paroeciis praeesse,</hi> and
                  were
                  the <hi>Rectors,</hi>
                  as we call them,
                  of particular Churches,
                
                and in the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where we
                  read of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                  ordained
                  <hi>in paroeciis  per paroecias,</hi> for the use
                  and service of particular Parishes.
                  And in this sense, but specially
                  indeed for a <hi>Countrey
                  Parish,</hi> the word is
                  taken
                  in an
                  Epistle of Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi>
                
                in which, <hi>Ecclesiae intra Civitatem
                  constitutae,</hi> the Churches
                  situated
                  in the City, are distinguished
                  plainly
                  from <hi>Paroecias,</hi> the Churches
                  scattered
                  in the Countrey.
                  Other Examples
                  of this nature, in the later
                  Ages,
                  being
                  almost infinite, and obvious to the eye of every Reader;
                  I forbear to add. So for the word ,
                  which we English <hi>Diocess,</hi>
                  it signified
                  at first, that part or portion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Empire (there being
                  thirteen of them
                  in all, besides
                  the <hi>Prefecture</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
                  before was
                  noted)
                  which was
                  immediately
                  under the command of the <hi>Vicarius</hi> or Lieutenant
                  General of those parts.
                  And was
                  so called
                  of , which signifieth
                  to Govern or Administer,
                
                as , in <hi>Isocrates,</hi>
                  , in <hi>Demosthenes:</hi> a
                  <hi>Diocess,</hi>
                  being
                  that part or portion of the Empire, which
                  was
                  committed
                  to the Government and Administration of some principal
                  Officer. In which regard, the word ,
                  or <hi>dioecesis,</hi> when it was
                  first borrowed
                  by the Church from the civil State,
                  was
                  used
                  to signifie
                  that part or portion of the Church, which
                  was
                  within the jurisdiction of a Primate,
                  containing
                  all the circuit of the civil Diocess,
                  as was
                  shewed
                  before: the <hi>Primate</hi> being
                  stiled
                  ordinarily
                   as in the Council of
                  <hi>Chalcedon;</hi>
                
                the Patriarch of the Diocess,
                  in the Laws
                  Imperial. But after, as the former ,
                  began
                  to lose its
                  former latitude, in which it signified
                  the whole command or Jurisdiction of a Bishop, which we
                  call a <hi>Diocess,</hi>
                  and grew
                  to be restrained
                  to so narrow a compass, as the poor
                  limits
                  of a Parish: so did
                  , grow less also, than at first it
                  was,
                  and from a Patriarchal Diocess,
                
                fell by degrees,
                  custom and use prevailing
                  in it (<hi>quem penes arbitrium
                  est,  ju  norma loquendi,</hi> as the Poet
                  hath
                  it) to signifie
                  no more than what <hi>Paroecia</hi>
                  had
                  done
                  formerly,
                  a <hi>Diocess,</hi>
                  as now we call it: whereof see <hi>Concil.

                  result of all is
                  this, that the Bishops
                  of the Primitive
                  times
                  were
                  <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi>
                  though they are called
                  , by some ancient
                  Writers:
                  and that in the succeeding
                  Ages,
                  as the Church increased,
                  and the Gospel of our Saviour did
                  inlarge
                  its
                  borders,
                  so did
                  the Countrey
                  Villages
                  obtain the name of <hi>Parishes,</hi>
                  or , having
                  to each of them
                  a Presbyter, for the administration of the
                  Sacraments,
                  for their instruction both in Faith and Piety,
                  whom
                  at this day we call the <hi>Rector</hi> of the Church or
                  Parish.
              </p>
              <p>
                And with this <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Rector,</hi>
                
                call him
                  as you will, must we now proceed, who by this
                  <hi>Institution,</hi> I mean the
                  setting
                  out of Parishes,
                  in the Countrey
                  Villages,
                  did
                  grow exceedingly
                  both in authority and reputation. For whereas upon the
                  setting
                  out of Parishes,
                
                the Presbyters
                  became
                  divided
                  into , and , the
                  City and the Countrey
                  Presbyters:
                  each of them
                  had
                  their several priviledges:
                  the <hi>City Presbyters</hi>
                  continuing,
                  as before, the great <hi>Council of Estate</hi> unto the
                  Bishop,
                
                and doing
                  many things,
                  which were
                  not suffered
                  to be done
                  by the <hi>Countrey
                  Presbyters;</hi>
                  and on the other side, the , or
                  <hi>Country Presbyters,</hi>
                  being
                  more remote, did
                  many Ministerial Acts
                  of their own authority, which in the presence of their
                  Bishop, it was
                  not lawful for them
                  to have done.
                  And therefore I conceive the resolution of Bishop
                  <hi>Downham</hi> in this case,
                
                to be sound and good, who telleth
                  us, <hi>That since the first distinguishing
                  of Parisher, and allotting
                  of several Presbyters
                  to them,
                  there hath
                  been
                  ever granted
                  to them
                  both</hi> potestas Ordinis, <hi>the power of
                  Orders,
                  as they are Ministers,</hi>
                  Et potestas jurisdictionis spiritualis seu internae,
                  <hi>a power of spiritual
                  and inward jurisdiction, to rule their flock after a
                  private manner, as it were</hi>
                  in foro Conscientiae, <hi>in the Court of Conscience, as
                  they are Pastors
                  of that flock.</hi> But because
                
                
                this allowance of a Jurisdiction <hi>in foro
                  Conscientiae,</hi> in the Court of Conscience,
                  seems
                  not sufficient unto some; who reckon the distinction of
                  a Jurisdiction <hi>in foro externo,</hi>
                
                <hi> in foro interno,</hi> to be like that of
                  <hi>Reflexius</hi> and <hi>Archipodialiter:</hi> they do
                  in this not only put the <hi>School-men</hi>
                  unto School again, in whom
                  the like distinctions
                  frequently
                  occur; but cross the best Divines
                  in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who do adhere unto,
                  and approve the said
                  distinctions.
                  And because many of both sorts
                  may be found in one, and that one publick's
                  declared
                  to be <hi>both Orthodox in doctrine, and consonant in
                  discipline to the Church of England,</hi> by great
                  Authority; I will use his words.
                
                <hi>A single Priest,</hi> qua talis, <hi>in that
                  formality and capacity only as he
                  is
                  a Priest, hath
                  no Key given
                  him
                  by God or man, to open the doors
                  of any external Jurisdiction. He
                  hath
                  a Consistory within</hi> in foro poenitentiae, <hi>in
                  the conscience of his Parishioners,
                  and a Key given
                  him
                  upon his institution, to enter into it. But he
                  hath
                  no Consistory without,</hi> in foro causae, <hi>in
                  medling
                  with Ecclesiastical causes,
                  unless he borrow a Key from his Ordinary. For although
                  they be the same Keys,
                  yet one of them
                  will not open all these wards:
                  the Consistory of outward
                  Jurisdiction, not being
                  to be opened
                  by a Key alone, but as you may observe in some great
                  mens gates,
                  by a Key and a Staff, which they
                  usually
                  call a</hi> Crosier. <hi>This</hi>
                  (saith
                  he) <hi>I have ever conceived
                  to be the ancient doctrine in this kind,
                  opposed
                  by none but professed
                  Puritans;
                  affirming
                  further, that all learned
                  men
                  in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>do adhere unto it:
                  allowing
                  the School-mens double power, that of Order, and that of
                  Jurisdiction, and the subdivision of this Jurisdiction,
                  into the internal and external,
                  appropriating
                  this last to the Bishop only.</hi> So he,
                  judiciously
                  indeed; and for the Authors
                  by him
                  cited,
                  both Protestant and School-Divines,
                  I refer you to him.
                  So then upon this setting
                  out of Parishes,
                  the Presbyters,
                  which attended
                  in the same, had
                  <hi>potestatem jurisdictionis,</hi> a power of
                  Jurisdiction granted
                  to them,
                  in the <hi>Court of Conscience:</hi> which
                  needed
                  not to have been
                  granted
                  before this time, when as Gods
                  people, which were
                  scattered
                  up and down the Countrey,
                  did
                  either come unto the Cities,
                  there to be made
                  partakers
                  of the Word and Sacraments,
                  in which the Bishop was
                  at hand to attend all businesses;
                  or that the Presbyters
                  were
                  by the Bishop sent
                  into the Countrey,
                  with more or less authority intrusted
                  to them,
                  as the business was.
                  And for the other power, the power of Order, although it
                  was
                  no other than before it was,
                  as to the power and faculty conferred
                  upon the Presbyters
                  in their <hi>Ordination:</hi> yet
                  did
                  they find a great enlargement and extension of it, in
                  the free execution of the same. For
                  whereas
                  formerly,
                  as was
                  observed
                  both from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  and some other Ancients,
                
                the Presbyter could not <hi>baptize,</hi>
                  nor celebrate the blessed
                  <hi>Eucharist, sine Episcopi authoritate,</hi> without
                  the leave and liking
                  of the Bishop; who then was
                  near at hand to be asked
                  the question: after this time, the
                  Presbyters
                  became
                  more absolute in their ministration,
                  <hi>baptizing,
                  celebrating,
                  preaching,</hi>
                  and indeed what not, which <hi>potestate ordinis,</hi>
                  did
                  belong unto him
                  only by vertue
                  of that general faculty, which had
                  been
                  granted
                  by the Bishop, at his <hi>Institution,</hi> I mean his
                  special designation to that place or Cure.

                And yet the Bishops
                  did
                  not so absolutely
                  invest the Presbyters,
                
                with a power of Order, in the administration of the
                  Sacraments,
                  as not to keep unto themselves a
                  superiour
                  Power, whereby the execution of that Power of Order,
                  together with a <hi>confirmation</hi>
                  of such acts
                  as had
                  been
                  done
                  by vertue
                  of the same, might generally
                  be observed
                  to proceed from them.
                  And of this kind especially
                  was
                  that rite or ceremony, which now we call by the
                  particular name of <hi>Confirmation;</hi>
                  being
                  called
                  anciently,
                  <hi>impositio manuum,</hi> the laying
                  on of hands.
                  For howsoever the original institution of it, be far
                  more ancient, and Apostolical, as most think: yet I
                  conceive it neither was
                  so frequent,
                  nor so necessary in the former times,
                  as in those that followed.
                  For when the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism,</hi> either
                  was
                  administred
                  to men
                  grown
                  in years,
                  or by the Bishop himself in person, or in his presence
                  at the least; he giving
                  his Fatherly and Episcopal
                  blessing
                  to the work in hand: the subsequent
                  laying
                  on of hands,
                  which we call <hi>Confirmation,</hi> might not seem so
                  necessary. Or if it did,
                  yet commonly,
                  it was
                  administred
                  with <hi>Baptism,</hi> as a <hi>Concomitant</hi>
                  thereof,
                
                to confirm and perfect that which the Grace of the
                  Spirit had
                  already begun
                  in Baptism. And so we are to understand
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> where having
                  spoken
                  before of <hi>Baptism,</hi> he addeth
                  next, <hi>Dehinc manus imponitur,
                  per benediciionem advocans  invitans Spiritum
                  sanctum,</hi> c. <hi>Then,</hi>
                  saith
                  he, <hi>followeth
                  imposition of hands,
                  with invocation, and invitation of the holy Ghost, which
                  willingly
                  cometh
                  down from the Father, to rest upon the
                  purified
                  and blessed
                  bodies,
                  acknowledging,
                  as it were,
                  the Waters
                  of Baptism for a fit seat.</hi> And so long as they
                  went
                  together, and were
                  both commonly
                  performed
                  by the same Minister, that is,
                  the Bishop, there was
                  the
                
                
                
                less notice taken
                  of it, and possibly
                  the less efficacy ascribed
                  unto it. But when they came
                  once to be severed,
                  as in the necessary absence of the Bishop they
                  had
                  been
                  before, and
                  on this setting
                  out of Parishes,
                  were
                  likely for the most part to be after: the
                  Bishops,
                  out of their abundant care of the
                  Churches
                  welfare, permitted
                  that which was
                  most necessary, to the common Presbyter;
                  reserving
                  that which was
                  more honorary,
                  to themselves alone. Thus was
                  it, in the first case, in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
                  time, who lived,
                  as was
                  before observed,
                
                in a kind of voluntary exile, as
                  did
                  also divers
                  other Bishops
                  in the heat and violence of persecutions:
                  during whose absence from their
                  Cities,
                  and their much distance from the
                  Countrey,
                  there is
                  no question to be made,
                  but that the Presbyters
                  performed
                  their Office in administration of that Sacrament, and
                  after which there is
                  little question, but that the Children
                  so baptized,
                  were
                  at some time or other brought
                  for <hi>Confirmation.</hi> Certain I
                  am,
                  that to him
                  they were
                  brought
                  to be <hi>confirmed,</hi>
                  and that he grounds
                  the <hi>Institution</hi> of that Right on the example of
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                
                in the Eighth
                  Chap. of the <hi>Acts.
                  Illi qui in Samaria crediderant,</hi> c. <hi>The
                  faithful
                  in</hi> Samaria, <hi>saith
                  he, had
                  already received
                  Baptism. Only that which was
                  wanting,</hi>
                  Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>supplyed,
                  by Prayer, and imposition of hands
                  to the end the holy Ghost might be
                  poured
                  on them.
                  Then adds,</hi>
                  Quod nunc quoque apud nos geritur, <hi>which also
                  is
                  done
                  amongst our selves,
                  when they which be already baptized,
                  are brought
                  unto the Prelates
                  of the Church</hi> (Praepositis
                  _cclesiae
                  offeruntur,) <hi>that by our Prayer and Imposition of
                  our hands)
                  they may receive the holy Ghost, and be
                  strengthened
                  by the seal of the Lord.</hi> And in the second case,
                
                it is
                  whereof <hi>Hierom</hi> speaketh,
                  where he observeth
                  it to be the custom of the Church, <hi>ut ad eos, qui
                  long in minoribus urbibus per Presbyteros 
                  Diaconos
                  baptizati sunt, Episcopus ad invocationem Spiritus
                  Sancti manum impositurus excurrat;</hi>
                  that the Bishop should go abroad, as in Visitation, and
                  imposing
                  hands,
                  pray for the gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> on
                  them,
                  who far off in the lesser Cities
                  (as also <hi>in Viculis  Castellis,</hi> in small
                  Towns
                  and Villages)
                  had
                  by the Presbyters
                  and Deacons
                  been
                  <hi>baptized.</hi>
                  But note withal that <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  tells
                  us, that this imposition of hands
                  was
                  reserved
                  only to the Bishop, <hi>ad honorem potius sacerdotii
                  quam ad legis necessitatem,</hi> not that the Sacrament
                  of <hi>Baptism</hi> was
                  not perfect and compleat
                  without it, but rather out of a certain congruity and
                  fitness to honour <hi>Prelacy</hi> with such
                  preheminencies;
                  the safety of the Church depending
                  upon the dignity of the <hi>chief Priest</hi> or
                  <hi>Bishop.</hi> By which, it doth appear to be St.
                  <hi>Hieroms</hi>
                  opinion,
                
                as <hi>Hooker</hi> excellently
                  collects,
                  <hi>That the Holy Ghost is
                  received
                  in Baptism, that Confirmation is
                  only a Sacramental complement; that the reason why
                  Bishops
                  alone did
                  ordinarily</hi>
                  confirm, <hi>was
                  not because the benefit, grace, and dignity thereof
                  was
                  greater
                  than of</hi> Baptism, <hi>but rather for that by the
                  Sacrament of Baptism men
                  being
                  admitted
                  into Gods
                  Church, it was
                  both reasonable and convenient, that if he
                  baptize
                  them
                  not, unto whom
                  the chiefest
                  authority and charge of their souls
                  belongeth,
                  yet for Honours
                  sake, and in token of his spiritual superiority over
                  them,
                  because to bless, is
                  an
                  act of Authority, the performance of this
                  annexed
                  Ceremony should be sought
                  for at his hands.</hi>
                  What other reasons
                  there are for it, in reference to the
                  parties
                  that receive the same, I forbear to
                  specifie
                  as not conducing
                  to the History of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which I have in
                  hand: to which estate the honour of
                  giving
                  <hi>Confirmation,</hi> hath
                  always
                  been
                  reserved
                  to this very day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another thing which followed
                  upon this setting
                  forth of Parishes
                  by <hi>Dionysius,</hi>
                
                was
                  the institution of a new Order in the Church betwixt the
                  Bishop and the Presbyter, being
                  neither of the two, but both. Those they
                  called
                  , or <hi>Rural
                  Bishops;</hi>
                  Of which, being
                  that there were
                  two sorts,
                  according
                  to the times
                  and Ages,
                  when they were
                  imployed;
                  we must distinguish them
                  accordingly.
                  Now of these <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi>
                  or <hi>Countrey
                  Bishops,</hi>
                  some in the point and power of <hi>Order,</hi>
                  were
                  no more than <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                  having
                  received
                  no higher
                  <hi>Ordination,</hi> than to that function in the
                  <hi>Ministery:</hi>
                  but were
                  inabled
                  by the Bishop under whom
                  they served,
                  to exercise some parts
                  of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as much as
                  was
                  thought fit to commit unto them,
                  for the better reiglement of the Church. And these I
                  take it, were
                  more ancient than the present times,
                  appointed
                  as the Bishops
                  Visitors,
                  to go abroad into the Countrey,
                  to parts
                  more remote, to oversee such Presbyters
                  as had
                  been
                  sent
                  forth for the instruction
                  of the people in small Towns
                  and Villages,
                  and to perform such further Offices,
                  which the ordinary Presbyter, for want of the like
                  latitude of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi>
                  was
                  defective in.
                
                These I conceive to be of the same nature with our
                  <hi>Rural Deans</hi>
                  in some parts
                  of <hi>England;</hi> And these are they which in the
                  Council of <hi>Neo-Caesarea,</hi> are
                  said
                  to be <hi>ordained</hi>
                  , after the manner of the
                  <hi>Seventy:</hi> and if no more than so, then but
                  simply
                  Presbyters
                  in the power of <hi>Order;</hi> though
                  ranked
                  above them
                  in regard of their Jurisdiction. To which Pope
                  <hi>Damasus</hi> agreeth
                  also,
                
                
                affirming
                  <hi>quod ipsi iidem sunt qui  Presbyteri,</hi>
                
                that they are the very same with
                  Presbyters,
                  being
                  first ordained,
                  <hi>ad exemplum Septuaginta,</hi> after the example of
                  the <hi>Seventy.</hi>
                  Others there were,
                  whom
                  we find furnished
                  with a further power, <hi>qui ver
                  Episcopalem
                  consecrationem acceperant,</hi> which
                  really
                  and truly
                  had
                  received
                  <hi>Episcopal Consecration,</hi>
                  and yet were
                  called
                  <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> because they
                  had
                  no Church nor Diocess
                  of their own, <hi>sed in aliena Ecclesia
                  ministrabant,</hi> but executed
                  their authority in anothers charge. And these,
                  saith
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> are such as we now call
                  <hi>Titular</hi> or <hi>Suffragan
                  Bishops:</hi>
                  such as those heretofore admitted
                  in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> whereof consult the
                  Act of Parliament, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.
                  Now that they had
                  <hi>Episcopal consecration,</hi>
                  appeareth
                  evidently
                  by the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where it
                  is
                  said
                  expresly
                  of them,
                  , that they
                  had
                  received
                  the Ordination of Bishops:
                
                and so by vertue
                  of their Ordination, might execute all manner of
                  Episcopal Acts,
                  which the Bishop of the City might perform. And to this
                  Power, they were
                  admitted
                  on two special reasons:
                  whereof the first was
                  to supply the absence of the Bishop, who
                  being
                  intent upon the business of the City, where his charge
                  was
                  greatest;
                  could not so well attend the business of the
                  Countrey,
                  or see how well the Presbyters
                  behaved
                  themselves in their several Parishes,
                  to which, upon the late division, they
                  were
                  sent
                  abroad. And this is
                  called
                  in the said
                  Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                
                , the looking
                  to the Administration of the Churches
                  under their authority. The other
                  was
                  to content such of the <hi>Novatian</hi>
                  Bishops,
                  who rather would continue in their schism and faction,
                  than return unto the Catholick
                  Church, with the loss of the honour and
                  calling
                  which they had
                  before: whom
                  they thought fit, if they were
                  willing to return to the Church again, to suffer in the
                  state of a <hi>Chorepiscopus.</hi>
                  And this is
                  that which was
                  so prudently
                  resolved
                  on in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (in which fifteen of
                  those which assembled
                  there, were
                  of this Order or Estate) <hi>viz.</hi>
                
                That if any of them
                  did
                  return to the Catholick
                  Church, either in City or Village,
                  wherein
                  there was
                  a Bishop, or a Presbyter before
                  provided,
                  , he should enjoy the place and
                  honour of a Presbyter: but if that
                  pleased
                  him
                  not, , he should be
                  fitted
                  with the Office of a <hi>Chorepiscopus.</hi>
                  Which being
                  the true condition of those <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> it
                  seems
                  to me a plain and evident mistake, that the
                  <hi>Chorepiscopus,</hi> who was
                  but a Presbyter,
                
                should be affirmed
                  to <hi>have power to impose hands,
                  and to ordain within his Precincts,
                  with the Bishops</hi>
                  licence. For certainly,
                  it is
                  apparent by the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the
                  <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> which had
                  power of conferring
                  Orders,
                  had
                  to that end received
                  <hi>Episcopal consecration,</hi> and
                  consequently,
                  could not but be more than Presbyters:
                  though at the first indeed they
                  medled
                  not therewith, without the leave and licence of the
                  Bishop, whose Suffragans
                  and Substitutes
                  they were.
                  But when they had
                  forgot
                  their ancient modesty, and did
                  not keep themselves within the bounds
                  and limits
                  appointed
                  to them;
                  which was
                  to make two Bishops
                  in one Diocess,
                  contrary to the ancient <hi>Canons;</hi>
                  the Church thought fitting
                  to reduce them
                  to their first condition. And thereupon it
                  was
                  decreed
                  in the Council of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> ,
                
                that it should no more be lawful for
                  them
                  to ordain either Presbyters
                  or Deacons:
                  that is
                  to say, as it was
                  afterwards
                  explained
                  in the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  ,
                
                without the liking
                  of the Bishop under whom
                  he served.
                  Howsoever, that they might have somewhat of the Bishop
                  in them,
                  they were
                  permitted
                  by that <hi>Canon,</hi> to ordain
                  <hi>Sub-Deacons,
                  Exorcists,</hi>
                  and <hi>Readers;</hi>
                  with which they were
                  required
                  to rest contented:
                  as also , to send abroad their
                  Letters
                  unto other Bishops,
                
                which they called
                  <hi>Literas Formatas,  Communicatorias</hi> (as
                  before was
                  noted)
                  as those that had
                  the full authority and power of
                  Bishops,
                  did
                  use of old to do at their <hi>Ordinations.</hi>
                  A point of honour, denied
                  unto the ordinary Presbyters,
                  in that very <hi>Canon.</hi>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now to proceed. The next Successor unto
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                
                is
                  called
                  <hi>Felix;</hi> but no more happy in some
                  things,
                  than his Predecessour:
                  the Heresie
                  of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi>
                  taking
                  beginning
                  in the time or Government in the one; that of the
                  <hi>Manichees,</hi>
                  commencing
                  almost with the other. <hi>Hujus tempore
                  Manes
                  quidam gente
                  Persa, vita  moribus barbarus,</hi> c. During
                  his time, saith
                  <hi>Platina,</hi> arose one <hi>Manes,</hi>
                
                by birth a <hi>Persian,</hi> in life and
                  manners
                  a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who took
                  upon him
                  to be <hi>Christ,</hi> gathering
                  unto him
                  Twelve Disciples,
                  for the dispersing
                  of his frenzies.
                  In this he differed
                  amongst many things
                  from <hi>Samosatenus:</hi> he making
                  <hi>Christ</hi> to be no better than a <hi>man;</hi> and
                  <hi>Manes</hi>
                  making
                  a vile sinful <hi>man</hi> to be the <hi>Christ.</hi> I
                  know <hi>Baronius</hi> doth place the
                  rising
                  of this <hi>Manicbean</hi> Heresie,
                  under <hi>Eutychianus,</hi>
                
                his next Successor;
                  and let them
                  reconcile the difference that list, for me. Suffice it
                  that the Heresie,
                
                
                
                being
                  risen
                  up, and being
                  so directly
                  contrary both to Faith and Piety: the
                  Bishops
                  of the Church bestirred
                  themselves both then and after, for the
                  suppressing
                  of the same, according
                  to their wonted
                  care of Her peace and safety. Not as before, in the case
                  of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> by Synodical
                  meetings,
                  which was
                  the only way could be taken
                  by them,
                  for the deposing
                  of him
                  from his Bishoprick,
                  which followed
                  as a part of his condemnation: but by discourse and
                  Argument in publick
                  Writings,
                  which might effectually
                  suppress the Heresie,
                  although the person of the Heretick
                  was
                  out of distance,
                  and to say truth,
                
                beyond their reach. The <hi>Persian</hi> King
                  had
                  eased
                  them
                  of that labour, who seizing
                  on that wretched miscreant, ,
                  commanded
                  him
                  to be flay'd alive, and thereby put
                  him
                  to death, as full of ignominy, as of pain. But for the
                  confutation of the Heresie,
                  which survived
                  the Author, that was
                  the business of the Bishops;
                  by whom,
                  as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> noteth,
                  ,
                
                many most admirable Disputations
                  had
                  been
                  made
                  in confutation of his Errors.
                  Particularly,

                  Not that the Bishops
                  of the <hi>West</hi> did
                  nothing in it, though not here named
                  by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who being
                  of another Language, could not so well take notice of
                  their Works
                  and Writings.
                  For after this, St. <hi>Austin,</hi> Bishop of
                  <hi>Hippo,</hi> wrote
                  so much against them;
                  and did
                  so fully
                  satisfie
                  and confute them
                  both, that he might justly
                  say with the Apostle, that he <hi>laboured
                  more abundantly
                  than they all.</hi> So careful were
                  the Bishops
                  of the Churches
                  safety, that never any Heretick
                  did
                  arise, but presently
                  they set a watch upon him,
                  and having
                  found what Heresies
                  or dangerous
                  doctrines
                  he dispersed
                  abroad, endeavoured
                  with all speed to prevent the mischief.

              <p>
                This,
                
                as they did
                  in other cases,
                  so was
                  their care the more remarkable, by how much
                  greater
                  was
                  the person whom
                  they were
                  to censure. Which as we have before
                  demonstrated,
                  in the case of <hi>Paulus,</hi> Patriarch of the Church
                  of <hi>Antioch;</hi> so we may see the like in their
                  proceedings
                  against <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> one of the
                  Popes
                  of <hi>Rome,</hi> the third from <hi>Felix,</hi> who
                  though he broached
                  no Heresie,
                  as the other did;
                  yet gave
                  as great a scandal to the Church as he, if not
                  greater
                  far. The times
                  were
                  hot and fiery, in the which he sat: so fierce a
                  persecution being
                  raised
                  against the Church by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi>
                  and his Associates
                  in the Empire, as never had
                  been
                  before: A persecution which extended
                  not only to the demolishing
                  of Churches,
                
                the Temples
                  of Almighty God; but to the extirpation of the
                  Scriptures,
                  the <hi>Books</hi>
                  and Oracles
                  of the Almighty.
                  And for the bodies
                  of his Servants,
                  some of which were
                  <hi>living
                  Libraries,</hi>
                  and all <hi>lively Temples,</hi>
                  even <hi>Temples
                  of the holy Ghost;</hi> it raged
                  so terribly
                  amongst them,
                  that within Thirty days,
                  Seventeen thousand Persons
                  of both sexes,
                  in the several parts
                  and Provinces
                  of the <hi>Romam</hi> Empire were
                  crowned
                  with Martyrdom, the Tyrants
                  so extreamly
                  raging,
                  <hi>Marcellinus</hi> comes
                  at last unto his trial: where being
                  wrought
                  upon either by
                  flattery, or fear, or both, he yielded
                  unto flesh and blood, and to preserve
                  his life,
                
                he betrayed
                  his Master. <hi>Ad sacrificium ductus est ut
                  thurificaret; quod  fecit,</hi>
                  saith
                  <hi>Damasus</hi> in the <hi>Pontifical;</hi> He
                  was
                  conducted
                  to the Temple, to offer incense to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Idols,
                  which he did
                  accordingly.
                  And this I urge not to the scandal and reproach of the
                  Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed 'tis no Reproach unto
                  her, that one amongst so many godly
                  Bishops,
                  most of them
                  being
                  Martyrs
                  also, should waver in the constancy of his
                  resolutions,
                  and for a season, yield unto those
                  persuasions,
                  which flesh and blood, and the predominant love of life
                  did
                  suggest unto him.
                  That which I urge it for is,
                  for the declaration of the Course which
                  was
                  taken
                  against him,
                  the manner how the Church proceeded
                  in so great a cause, and in the which so great a Person
                  was
                  concerned.
                  For though the crime were
                  great and scandalous, tending
                  to the destruction of the flock of Christ, which
                  being
                  much guided
                  by the example of so prime a Pastor, might
                  possibly
                  have been
                  seduced
                  to the like Idolatry; and that great
                  numbers
                  of them
                  ran
                  into the Temple, and were
                  spectators
                  of that horrid action:
                  yet find we not that any of them
                  did
                  revile him
                  in word or deed, or pronounced
                  hasty judgment
                  on him;
                  but left the cognizance of the cause to
                  them,
                  to whom
                  of right it did
                  belong. Nor is
                  it an
                  hard matter to discern who these
                  Judges
                  were.
                  Laymen
                  they could not be,
                
                that's sure. <hi>Quando audisti in causa fidei Laicos de
                  Episcopis judicasse?</hi>
                  When did
                  you ever hear, saith
                  <hi>Ambrose,</hi> speaking
                  of the times
                  before him,
                
                
                that Lay-men
                  in a point of Faith did
                  judge of Bishops?
                  And Presbyters
                  they were
                  not neither, they had
                  no Authority to judge the Person of a Bishop. That
                  Bishops
                  had
                  Authority to censure and depose their
                  Presbyters
                  we have shewn
                  already; that ever any Presbyters
                  did
                  take upon them
                  to judge their Bishop is
                  no where to be found, I dare boldly
                  say it, in all the practice of Antiquity. For
                  being
                  neither <hi>munere pares,</hi>
                
                nor <hi>jure suniles,</hi> equal in function, nor alike
                  in law, they were
                  disabled
                  now in point of reason
                  from such bold attempts,
                  as afterwards
                  disabled
                  by Imperial Edict. A simple Biship
                  might as little intermeddle in it as a simple Presbyter;
                  for Bishops
                  severally
                  and apart were
                  not to judge their Metropolitan, no nor one another.
                  Being
                  of equal Order and Authority, and
                  seeing
                  that <hi>Par in parem non habet potestatem,</hi> that
                  men
                  of equal rank, <hi>qua tales,</hi>
                  are of equal power, one of them
                  cannot be the others Judge for want of some transcendent
                  power to pass sentence on him.
                  Which as it was
                  of force in all other cases
                  wherein a Bishop was
                  concerned,
                  so most especially
                  in this wherein the party Criminal
                  was
                  a Metropolitan, and more than so, the Primate or
                  Patriarch of the Diocess.
                  So that all circumstances
                  laid
                  together, there was
                  no other way conceivable
                  in these ancient times,
                  than to call a Council, the greatest
                  Ecclesiastical Tribunal
                  of Christ on earth, there to debate the business, and
                  upon proof of the offence, to proceed to
                  judgment.
                  This had
                  been
                  done
                  before in the case of <hi>Paulus,</hi> and this
                  is
                  now resolved
                  on in the present too. Accordingly
                  the Bishops
                  of those Churches,
                  and as many other as could be drawn
                  together in that dangerous time,
                
                Assembled
                  at <hi>Sinuessa</hi>
                  (now called
                  <hi>Suessa</hi>) a City of <hi>Campania,</hi> 180. in
                  the total, as it is
                  in <hi>Platina.</hi> Where though they
                  had
                  sufficient proof of that foul offence, yet because
                  <hi>Marcellinus</hi> stood
                  upon the Negative, <hi>negabat se
                  thurifiesse,</hi> as the
                  <hi>Acts</hi>
                  declare,
                
                they thought it fit not to proceed unto the sentence,
                  till they had
                  brought
                  him
                  to confession. <hi>Ex ore tuo justificaberis,
                   ex ore tuo condemnaberis,</hi> as <hi>Petrus,</hi>
                  one of the Bishops
                  then assembled
                  did
                  press it on him.
                  Not that being
                  met
                  Synodically
                  they did
                  want Authority to proceed against
                  him,
                  as the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Doctors
                  vainly
                  say;
                
                but that it was
                  more consonant to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  Laws,
                  that to the testimony of the Witnesses
                  the confession of the party should be
                  added
                  also. Which when they had
                  procured
                  from him,
                  <hi>Subscripserunt in ejus damnationem, 
                  damnaverunt eum extra Civitatem,</hi> they all
                  condemned
                  him,
                  say the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  and all subscribed
                  unto the Condemnation: <hi>Helchiades</hi> one of the
                  Bishops
                  there Assembled,
                  being
                  the first that led
                  the way. And therefore that which
                  followeth
                  after, <hi>Prima sedes non judicabitur 
                  quoquam,</hi> that the Bishop of the first See shall be
                  judged
                  of none, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  so much insists
                  on, was
                  either foisted
                  in by some later
                  hand,
                
                the better to advance the Popes
                  Supremacy, or else must be interpreted,
                  as it fairly
                  may, <hi>non judicabitur  quoquam,</hi> that no
                  particular person of what rank soever,
                  had
                  any power to judge his Primate.
              </p>
              <p>
                So great a person as <hi>Marcellinus</hi>
                  being
                  fallen
                  so foully
                  (though after he recovered
                  footing
                  and died
                  a Martyr for the Gospel) It is
                  the less to be admired,
                
                
                if many of inferiour
                  quality did
                  betray the cause, and fell into the like
                  Idolatries.
                  The persecution was
                  both fierce and long, though never at the height till
                  the last years
                  of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and more than ever
                  were
                  the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> who had
                  for saving
                  of their lives
                  denied
                  their Saviour. Who when they came
                  unto themselves, and having
                  made
                  their way unto it by some appearance of contrition,
                  desired
                  to be admitted
                  to the blessed
                  Sacrament, the Bishops
                  were
                  much troubled
                  with their importunity; those godly
                  Prelates
                  being
                  as well careful of the Churches
                  Discipline as the unfortunate estate of those wretched
                  men.
                  Besides
                  the quality of their offence appearing
                  in some greater,
                  in some less than others, it put
                  them
                  unto no small trouble how to proportion the
                  intended
                  penance unto the nature of the crime. For remedy
                  whereof, <hi>Petrus</hi> the godly Patriarch of
                  <hi>Alexandris, diversa adhibens
                  pro conditione
                  cujusque medicamenta vulneribus,</hi>
                
                fitting
                  each several wound with a proper
                  plaister,
                  as <hi>Baronius</hi> hath
                  it, published
                  certain Canons
                  and instructions
                  for their direction in the same. A copy of the which we
                  have both in <hi>Baronius</hi> and the
                  <hi>Bibliotheca.</hi>
                  This, as it gave
                  great ease unto the Prelates
                  in the Eastern parts,
                  where the authority of the man was
                  great and prevalent: So in the <hi>West</hi> the
                  Bishops
                  of particular Churches
                  spared
                  no pains
                  nor labour for the upholding
                  of that Discipline which they received
                  from the hands
                  of their Predecessors.
                  In <hi>Spain</hi> particularly,
                  where both the number and condition of these
                  <hi>Lapsi</hi> seemed
                  more considerable,
                
                the Bishops
                  of the Province of <hi>Betica</hi>
                  called
                  a Council at <hi>Eliberis,</hi> then a prime City of
                  those parts
                  (near to the ruines
                  of the which, the City of <hi>Granada</hi> standeth,)
                  <hi>Osius,</hi> that famous Confessor
                  being
                  there amongst them,
                  where they established
                  divers
                  Canons,
                  81. in all, for
                
                
                
                confirmation of the publick
                  Discipline, and holding
                  up of that severity, by which the same
                  had
                  been
                  maintained.
                  Of all which number those which concern our business are
                  these five especially.
                
                First, it is
                  ordered
                  that neither Bishops,
                  Presbyters,
                  nor Deacons
                  should leave the place in which they
                  served
                  to follow Merchandise, <hi>de locis suis negociandi
                  causa non discedant,</hi> nor wander up and down the
                  Countrey
                  after gainful Markets.
                  In which it was
                  provided
                  notwithstanding, that <hi>ad victum sibi
                  conquirendum</hi> that for their necessary maintenance
                  they might send abroad on those
                  employments
                  their Sons,
                  or men,
                  or Servants,
                  or any other; and for their own
                  parts,
                  if they would needs
                  take that course, <hi>intra Provinciam negotientur,</hi>
                  they were
                  required
                  to contain
                  themselves within the compass of the Province, in the
                  which they ministred.
                  It seems
                  the Fathers
                  of the Council were
                  not so severe, though otherwise tenacious enough of the
                  Ancient Canons;
                  as to conceive that Merchandizing,
                  a secular imployment
                  doubtless, was
                  utterly
                  inconsistent with holy Orders;
                  especially
                  if either it conduced
                  unto the maintenance of their selves
                  and Families,
                  or that it did
                  not take them
                  off from the attendance on those
                  places
                  in which their Ministery
                  was
                  required.
                  This for the maintenance, the next
                  was
                  for the honour of Episcopacy. For in the 32. it
                  is
                  ordained,
                
                that those who in some grievous <hi>Lapse</hi> be in
                  danger of eternal death, <hi>apud Presbyterum
                  poenitentiam agere non debere, sed potius apud
                  Episcopum,</hi> ought not to make confession to, or be
                  enjoyned
                  penance by a Presbyter, but to or by the Bishop only,
                  unless it be
                  in urgent and extream
                  necessity, in the which case a Presbyter might admit
                  him
                  unto the Communion, as might a Deacon also by the
                  appointment of the Presbyter.
                  Of this sort also this that followeth,
                
                by which it is
                  decreed,
                  <hi>ut ab eo Episcopo quis accipiat Communionem,</hi>
                  that Sinners
                  be admitted
                  to the Sacrament by that Bishop only, by
                  whom
                  for their offences
                  they had
                  been
                  formerly
                  Excommunicated;
                  and that if any other Bishop presumed
                  to admit him
                  thereto, the Bishop who had
                  Excommunicated
                  him,
                  neither being
                  made
                  acquainted
                  with it, nor consenting
                  to it, he was
                  to render an
                  account of it unto his Colleagues,
                  <hi>Cum status sui periculo,</hi> even with the danger
                  of his place,
                
                Of the same temper is
                  a fourth, wherein it is
                  enacted,
                  That if any Deacon, having
                  a cure or charge committed
                  to him,
                  shall Baptize
                  any of that cure without a Presbyter or Bishop,
                  <hi>Episcopus eos per benedictionem perficere
                  debebit;</hi> the Bishop is
                  required
                  to confirm the party by his Episcopal benediction. With
                  this <hi>Proviso</hi> notwithstanding,
                  that if the party do decease before confirmation,
                  <hi>Sub fide qua quis credidit,
                  poterit esse justus,</hi> it is
                  to be conceived
                  that by the Sacrament of Baptism, he
                  had
                  received
                  all things
                  necessary to salvation. Nor did
                  the Fathers
                  in this Council take order only for the
                  Bishops
                  in point of honour, but they provided
                  also for the whole Clergy in point of safety;
                
                decreeing
                  by a full consent, that if any person whatsoever should
                  accuse either Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon
                  falsly,
                  and could not make just proof of the Accusation, <hi>nec
                  in fine dandam ei communionem,</hi> that he should not
                  be admitted
                  to the blessed
                  Sacrament, no not upon his death-bed, in his last
                  extremity. So tender were
                  they in that Age, of the good name and reputation of
                  their Clergy.
              </p>
              <p>
                And now me-thinks
                  I see a blessed
                  Sun-shine,
                
                a time of rest and quiet after all these
                  troubles;
                  a gentle gale breathing
                  upon the Church after so many tedious
                  storms
                  of Persecution. For <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and
                  <hi>Maximianus</hi> his Colleague, either
                  afflicted
                  with the guilt of Conscience, or
                  tyred
                  with the effusion of so much innocent blood as
                  had
                  by them
                  been
                  shed in this Persecution, did
                  of their own accord resign the Empire, <hi>Anno</hi>
                  304. as <hi>Baronius</hi> calculates
                  it; leaving
                  the same unto <hi>Constantius</hi> and
                  <hi>Galerius,</hi> whom
                  they had
                  long before created
                  <hi>Caesars.</hi>
                
                Of these <hi>Constantius</hi> taking
                  to himself the <hi>Western</hi>
                  parts,
                  lived
                  not full two years,
                  leaving
                  his own part of the Empire, and a fair ground for all
                  the rest to <hi>Constantine</hi> his Son; not only born
                  of <hi>Helena</hi> a <hi>British</hi>
                  Woman, but
                  born at <hi>York,</hi> the Mother-City, or Metropolis of
                  the <hi>British</hi> Nation. A Prince
                  whom
                  God raised
                  up of purpose, not only to give end to the
                  Persecutions,
                  wherewith the Innocent Spouse of Christ
                  had
                  been
                  so tortured
                  and tormented;
                  but to become the greatest
                  nursing
                  Father thereunto, that ever was
                  before him
                  in the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> or since
                  him
                  in the <hi>Israel</hi> of the Church. So that if
                  heretofore you find the Clergy reckoned
                  as the filth of men,
                  neglected,
                  slighted,
                  or disgraced,
                  esteemed
                  unworthy
                  either of publick
                  trust or favour in the employments
                  of the State: It is
                  to be imputed
                  unto this, that they were
                  held
                  a dangerous and suspected
                  party to the Commonwealth,
                  maintaining
                  a Religion contrary unto that which
                  was
                  allowed
                  in the Empire. Hereafter you shall find it otherwise.
                  Hereafter you shall find an
                  Edict made
                  by <hi>Constantine,</hi>
                  enabling
                  such as would decline the sentence of the Secular
                  Judges,
                
                , lawfully
                  to appeal unto the judgment
                  of their Bishops;
                
                
                whose judgment
                  he commanded
                  to be put in execution by all his
                  Officers,
                  with as much punctuality and effect, as if himself in
                  person had
                  pronounced
                  the same. Hereafter
                  we shall find Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> a right godly
                  Bishop,
                
                so taken
                  up with hearing
                  and determining
                  mens suits
                  and causes
                  that he had
                  very little leisure either for corporal
                  repast or
                  private study: Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> who
                  relates
                  the former, saying
                  also this, that he had
                  long waited
                  an
                  opportunity to have conference with
                  him,
                  and had
                  as long been
                  hindred
                  from access unto him;
                  <hi>Secludentibus me ab ejus aure atque ore catervis
                  negotiosorum
                  hominum, quorum infirmitatibus serviebat,</hi> his
                  access to him
                  being
                  barred
                  by multitudes
                  of Suiters,
                  whose businesses
                  he was
                  pleased
                  to undertake. Hereafter we shall find the same Saint
                  <hi>Austin</hi> no such lazie
                  Prelate, but that he hath
                  transmitted
                  to us as many monuments
                  both of his Piety and Learning,
                  as any other whosoever; so busied
                  on the like occasions,
                  that he could hardly
                  save the Mornings
                  for his Meditations:
                
                <hi>Post meridiem occupationibus hominum teneri,</hi>
                  the afternoons
                  being
                  wholly
                  taken
                  up in the dispatch
                  or hearing
                  of mens private Connoversies. Nay, when the
                  Councils
                  of <hi>Carthage</hi>
                  and <hi>Numidia</hi> had
                  imposed
                  a certain task upon him,
                  <hi>propter curam Scripturarum,</hi> in some
                  things
                  that concerned
                  the holy Scriptures;
                  and that he asked
                  but five days
                  respite
                  from the affairs
                  and business of the people for the performance of the
                  same: the People would not have the patience to forbear
                  so long, <hi>Sed violenter
                  irruptum est,</hi> but violently
                  brake
                  in upon him.
                  And this, lest the good Father may be thought to speak
                  it in commendation of his own abilities,
                  we find related
                  also by <hi>Possidonius</hi> in the narration of his
                  life; where we are told,
                  <hi>aliquando usque ad horam refectionis,</hi>
                
                <hi>aliquando tota die jejunans,</hi> that
                  sometimes
                  he gave
                  hearing
                  to mens causes
                  till the hour of repast, and sometimes
                  fasted
                  all the day for dispatch thereof, but
                  always
                  bringing
                  them
                  unto some end or other, <hi>pro arbitrata
                  aequitate,</hi> according
                  to the rules
                  of equity and a wellgrounded
                  Conscience. Hereafter we shall find the
                  Prelates
                  honoured
                  with the titles
                  of , most honourable
                  Lords;
                  and that not once or twice,
                
                but of common course. Hereafter (not to wander through
                  more particulars)
                  we shall find Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                  employed
                  in the most weighty matters
                  of the Common-wealth, and sent
                  Ambassadour
                  from the young Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> to the
                  Tyrant <hi>Maximus,</hi> who had
                  usurped
                  on his Dominions,
                  and much endangered
                  the whole Empire, which he performed
                  to so good purpose, that he preserved
                  <hi>Italy</hi> from an
                  imminent ruin; the Tyrant afterwards
                  confessing,
                  <hi>se legationis ejus objectu ad Italiam non potuisse
                  transire,</hi> that he was
                  hindred
                  by the same, from passing
                  forwards
                  into <hi>Italy</hi> with his conquering
                  Army. So little was
                  it either thought or found in those
                  blessed
                  times,
                  that holy Orders
                  did
                  superinduce a disability for civil Prudence.
              </p>
              <p>
                But these things
                  we do here behold but at a distance,
                
                as <hi>Moses</hi>
                  from Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> saw
                  the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They appertain of right to
                  the following
                  Age;
                
                and they which had
                  the happiness to live till then could not but
                  easily
                  discern the great alteration,
                  which was
                  between a Church under Persecution and a Church in
                  Peace; between
                  a Church oppressed
                  by Tyrants,
                  and a Church cherished
                  and supported
                  by a Christian Prince. And in this
                  flourishing
                  estate I should gladly
                  shew
                  her, but that my wearied
                  pen doth desire some rest; and that I would fain see
                  with what acceptation my present
                  pains
                  will be received
                  in the world, before I give the second on-set. In the
                  mean time I will lay down a brief Chronology of such of
                  the remarkable occurrences
                  which have been
                  represented
                  in these two last Centuries,
                  it being
                  the office of an
                  upright Judge, and only such I do desire should peruse
                  these Papers,
                  <hi>ut res, ita tempora rerum noscere,</hi> to know as
                  well the times
                  and circumstances
                  of business as the things
                  themselves.

          <head>A PREFACE.</head>
          <p>ALthough there
            are Books
            enough writ to vindicate the Honours
            and Priviledges
            of Bishops,
            yet to those that are fore-stalled
            with prejudice and passion, all that can be
            said
            or done
            will be little enough to make them
            wise unto sobriety; to prevail with
            them
            not to contradict the conviction
            of their mind with absurd and fond
            reasonings,
            but that Truth may conquer their
            prepossessions,
            and may find so easie
            an
            access and welcome unto their practical
            judgments,
            that they may profess their faith and subjection to that
            order, which by a misguided
            zeal they once endeavoured
            to destroy.</p>
          <p>
            Many are the methods
              that have been,
              and are still used
              to rase up the foundation
              of Episcopacy, and to make the Name of <hi>Bishop</hi> to be
              had
              no more in remembrance.
              For first some strike at the Order and Function it self: And
              yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons
              it among his <hi>faithful sayings,</hi>
            
            that the <hi>Office of a Bishop
              is
              a good work.</hi> And the order
              continued
              perpetually
              in the Church without
              any interruption of time, or decrees
              of Councils
              to the contrary, for the space of many
              Centuries
              after the Ascension of Christ, and the Martyrdom of the
              Apostles.
              For they ordained
              Bishops
              and approved
              them.
              Before St. <hi>John</hi> died,
              <hi>Rome</hi> had
              a succession of no less than four, <hi>viz. Linus,
              Anacletus, Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Evaristus; Jerusalem</hi>
              had
              <hi>James</hi> the just, and <hi>Simeon</hi> the Son of
              <hi>Cleophas; Antioch</hi> had
              <hi>Euodius</hi>
              and <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and St. <hi>Mark, Anianus,
              Abilius</hi> and <hi>Cerdo</hi>
              successively
              fill'd the See of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> All these
              lived
              in St. <hi>Johns</hi>
              days;
              and their order obeyed
              by Christians,
              and blessed
              by God throughout the whole world for the Conversion of
              <hi>Jews</hi>
              and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
              for the <hi>perfecting
              of the Saints,
              and the edifying
              of the Body of Christ:</hi> Nay, their labour
              was
              blessed
              by God first for the Conversion, and then for the
              Resormation of this Church and Kingdom; and therefore I hope
              there is
              no sober Protestant in <hi>England,</hi> but will
              heartily
              say, <hi>Amen</hi> to that Prayer of Mr. <hi>Beza</hi>'s,
              who although no great Adorer of Episcopacy, yet
              considerdering
              the Blessings
              that God brought
              to this Nation by their Ministry, put up this devout
              Petition,
            
            <hi>Fruatur Anglia ista singulari Dei Beneficenti,
              quae utinam sit illi perpetua,</hi>
              Let <hi>England</hi> enjoy that singular
              Blessing
              of God, which I pray to God may be perpetual to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are others that envy them
              their Honours
              and Dignities.
              For though the Holy Spirit of God
              does
              oblige all Christians
              <hi>to esteem their</hi> Bishops
              <hi>very highly</hi>
              (or more than abundantly
              ) <hi>in love for their work sake,
              1</hi> Thes. <hi>5.12, 13.</hi> and reason it self
              dictates
              that the honours
              confer'd upon Representatives
              and Embassadors,
              redound to the Prince that delegates
              and imploys
              them;
              though <hi>Jews,
              Heathens,</hi>
              and <hi>Mahom_tans</hi>
            
            
            
            ever paid
              the profoundest
              Veneration to their <hi>Priests,
              Caliphs,</hi>
              and <hi>Musti's,</hi> and our Relig ous
              Ancestors
              in the <hi>Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
              times,
              set the highest
              value upon their Bishops;
              yet the Religion of this Age is
              to load them
              with all possible Calumnies
              and Reproaches,
              and with <hi>Corah</hi> and his
              Complices
              to charge them
              with <hi>taking
              too much upon them,</hi>
              and to disdain to set them
              with the Dogs
              of their Flocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Priests
              were
              Judges
              in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so were
              the <hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Areopagites</hi>
              (who were
              sacred persons)
              in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Athens;</hi> and it
              was
              no other wise with the <hi>Druids</hi>
              amongst the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> and
              <hi>Gauls.</hi>
              For <hi>Caesar</hi> tells
              us how their Office extended
              to things
              Temporal as well as Religious;
            
            that they did
              not only <hi>order publick
              and private Sacrifices,
              and expound Religion,</hi> and instruct
              Youth, but were
              free from <hi>Contribution and Warfare,
              and all burthens
              of</hi> State, <hi>and determined
              all Controversies,
              both publick
              and private,</hi> and executed
              the place both of Priests
              and Judges;
              for <hi>if any offence were
              committed,
              as Murther
              or Man-slaughter or any Controversie
              arose touching
              Lands
              or Inheritance, they sentenced
              it, rewarding
              the Vertuous,
              and punishing
              the Wicked.</hi> The <hi>Patricii,</hi> the
              noblest
              <hi>Romans</hi>
              were
              ambitious to be admitted
              into the College of the Priests;
              and when the Government became
              Monarchical, the Emperors
              took
              upon them
              the pontifical Dignity, thinking
              it no diminution of them
              Grandeur to be
              imployed
              about the Service of the gods,
              but rather conceiving
              the Priesthood too noble an
              imployment
              to be confer'd upon a Subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we need no other Testimonies
              to convince us of the Rights
              of Churchmen,
              for the management of the civil
              concerns
              of human Society, that the holy
              Scriptures.
              Amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
              the Civil and Ecclesiastical power
              were
              not so distinguished,
              but one and the same person exercised
              both. For not to expatiate upon particular
              instances,
              <hi>Melchisedeck,
              Eli, Samuel, Ezra, Esdras,</hi>
              were
              all Priests,
              and had
              the power not only of Ecclesiastical, but Civil
              jurisaictior. Neither could <hi>Samuel</hi> have
              hewed
              <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces
              with his own hand,
            
            if it had
              been
              unlawful for persons
              dedicated
              to the sacred Offices
              of Religion to hav intermeddled
              in causes
              of blood: Which very instance proves
              that Clergy-men
              are not excluded
              from managing
              the highest
              secular concerns
              by any immutable Laws
              of God or Nature. And if there are any
              <hi>Canons</hi>
              or <hi>Councils</hi>
              that forbid them
              to meddle in things
              of that kind, that so they may the better attend upon the
              sacred Offices
              and Exercises
              of Religion, let those be obligatory to the
              persons
              unto whom
              they were
              delivered,
              but not be pleaded
              or produced
              to the prejudice of <hi>English</hi>
              Bishops,
              who have distinct Priviledges
              and Laws.
              For there have been
              <hi>Constitutions</hi>
              that have forbidden
              Church-men
              to Marry, to make Wills,
              to be Executors
              of mens Wills
              and Testaments,
              to be the Wards
              of Orphans,
              <hi>c.</hi> And these Constitutions
              are of as great force to bind the Clergy of
              <hi>England,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> to
              thrust the Bishops
              out of the House of Lords
              in Causes
              of Attainder and Blood. Let the
              Archbishops
              of <hi>Ments</hi> and <hi>Colen,</hi> with other
              Princes
              of the Empire look to it, if it be unlawful for
              Ecclesiastical persons
              to adjudge
              Criminals
              to death.
          </p>
          <p>It will be infinite to shew
            how St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and the Godly
            Bishops
            of all Ages
            had
            no <hi>Supersedeas</hi> given
            them
            to intermeddle in things
            civil and secular, because of their Wisdom and Knowledge in
            things
            Sacred and Divine. Certainly
            the Holy Spirit of God did
            not conceive it unfit that Worldly
            matters
            and Controversies
            should be committed
            to Church-men;
            for it is
            highly
            reasonable to think that those who are the
            Pastors
            of mens Souls,
            will be the best Judges
            in determining
            their civil Rights.</p>
          
          
          <p>
            It could not indeed be expected,
              whilst the Empire was
              Heathen, that Bishops
              should be busied
              and employed
              in Secular affairs,
              unless it were
              in those Controversies
              which arose among the Christians
              themselves, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi>
              gives
              direction that they should rather determine their
              Contentions
              by a private Arbitrement
              of their own, than by the publick
              judgments
              of their Enemies.
            
            But when Kings
              became
              Christians,
            
            we find persons
              making
              their Appeals
              from the Tribunals
              of Princes
              to the Consistory of Bishops.
              For then Bishops
              had
              power to reverse the sentence of death, and to stay the
              hands
              of Executioners,
              when the poor Criminals
              were
              going
              to receive the reward of their Iniquities;
              just as the <hi>Praetors</hi> and
              <hi>Consuls</hi>
              of <hi>Rome</hi> would submit their <hi>Fasces,</hi> those
              Ensigns
              of Authority, when they did
              but casually
              meet with some of the Priests.
              <hi>Constantine</hi>
              granted
              the Bishops
              this priviledge,
              that condemned
              Malefactors
              might appeal unto their Courts;
              and when such appeals
              were
              made,
              the Bishops
              had
              power as well to deliver them
              over into the hands
              of Justice, as to extend unto them
              a Pardon or Reprieve. For the priviledge
              confer'd on them,
              was
              as well for the punishment and terror of the Wicked, as for
              mitigating
              the rigour of Justice, and encouraging
              Criminals
              to Vertue
              and Repentance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
              himself, who was
              none of the best Friends
              to Church-men,
              grants,
              that for four thousand years
              the Civil and Ecclesiastick
              jurisdiction went
              always
              hand in hand together.
            
            And so it did
              till Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> made
              the one independent upon the other. So that their disunion
              is
              a Popish Innovation; for till his time the
              Judges
              of Church and State ever sate together;
              affairs
              Sacred and Religious were
              scan'd and determined
              in the morning, and those that were
              Secular and Civil in the afternoon. There
              was
              not, till that time, any clashing
              between <hi>Moses</hi>
              and <hi>Aaron;</hi> no prohibitions
              out of one Court to stop or evacuate the
              proceedings
              of another,
              and then it was
              that <hi>Justice run down like a stream, and Righteousness
              like a mighty River.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>If it be said
            that there are many corruptions
            among Church-men,
            and especially
            in Ecclesiastical Courts:
            The answer is,
            That Callings
            must be distinguish'd
            from persons,
            or else those two noble professions
            of Law and Physick
            will fall under the same condemnation with Divinity. No man of
            any sobriety will condemn either of those
            professions,
            because there are some Empericks
            in the World who kill mens Bodies,
            and some Petifoggers
            that intangle
            and ruine
            their Estates.
            And I hope Divines
            may have some grains
            of allowance granted
            them,
            as well as the Inns
            of Court and Chancery, and the College of
            Physicians;
            if they cannot, let that Calling
            which is
            most innocent cast the first stone.</p>
          <p>
            It cannot be hoped
              that there will in this Age be a Revival of the primitive
              usage of these two Jurisdictions.
              But yet this ought to be seriously
              regarded
              by all who have any belief of a Deity and regard for their
              native Country; I mean that either our English
              Monarchs
              might be totally
              excused
              from their Coronation-Oath,
              or not be put upon a necessity of
              violating
              thereof. Their Oath in favour of the Clergy,
              is,
              that they will <hi>grant and keep the
              Laws,
              Customs,
              and Franchises
              granted
              to the Clergy by the glorious King St.</hi> Edward <hi>their
              Predecessor, according
              to the Laws
              of God,</hi>
            
            <hi>the true profession of the Gospel
              established
              in this Kingdom, agreeable to the
              Prerogative
              of the Kings
              thereof, and the Ancient customs
              of the Realm.</hi> But how this Oath
              is
              observed,
              when the Bishops
              are infringed
              in their ancient and indisputable
              priviledges,
              let it be considered
              by all persons
              of sober mind.
            
            
            
            and principles.
              And let it be declared
              what order of men
              in the whole Nation the King can rely upon with so much
              safety and confidence, as upon the
              Bishops;
              and that not only upon the account of their
              Learning,
              Wisdom, Sanctity and Integrity (qualifications
              not every day to be met
              withal in State-Politicians)
              but upon the score of Gratitude and Interest. For 'tis from
              their Prince that they derive their
              Honours,
              Dignities,
              Titles,
              Revenues,
              Priviledges,
              Power, Jurisdictions,
              with all other secular advantages;
              and upon this account there is
              greater
              probability that they will be faithful to his
              Concerns
              and Interests,
              than those who receive nothing from
              him
              but the common advantages
              of Government.
              But this argument is
              known
              too well by our Anti-Episcopal Democraticks.
              And perhaps 'tis the chief, if not the only reason of their
              enmity against an
              Order of men
              of so sacred and venerable an
              Institution.
          </p>
          <p>As for this little Treatise, the Author of it
            is
            too well known
            unto this Nation,
            to invite any Scholar to peruse it. It
            was
            written
            when the Bishops
            were
            Voted
            by the House of Lords
            not to be of the Committee in the Examination of the Earl of
            <hi>Strafford.</hi> For then it
            was
            that Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
            considered
            the case, and put these few Sheets
            as a MSS. into the hands
            of several of the Bishops,
            that they might be the better enabled
            to assert and vindicate their own
            Rights.
            It was
            only intended
            for private use, and therefore the Reader
            is
            not to expect so punctual an
            accuracy as he may find in other
            Treatises
            of this Learned
            Author. It has
            been
            perused
            by some persons
            of good Eminency for judgment
            and station in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and by
            them
            approved
            and commended.
            All that is
            wished
            by the Publisher is,
            that it may produce the effects
            which he proposes
            to himself in exposing
            it to publick
            view; and that those Lords
            who are now Prisoners
            in the Tower, and from whose tryal
            some have laboured
            to exclude the Bishops,
            were
            able to give unto the World as convincing
            Evidence of their Innocency,
            as that great and generous States
            man did,
            who fell a Sacrifice to a prevailing
            Faction; and whose Innocent Blood
            was
            so far from being
            a lustration
            to the Court (as some thought it would have
            proved)
            as it drew
            after it such a deluge of Gore, as for many
            preceding
            years
            had
            never been
            spilt
            in this Kingdom.</p>
          <p>But 'tis not my design or desire to revive any of the
            Injustice or Inhumanities
            of the last Age. Suffice it to say, that it
            was
            for this Apostolical Government of
            Bishops
            that King <hi>Charles</hi> the First
            lost
            his Kingdoms,
            his Crown, his Life. And the exclusion of
            Bishops
            from Voting
            in causes
            of blood, was
            the prologue to all those Tragical
            mischiefs
            that happened
            to that Religion and Renowned
            Prince. And those who have the least veneration for his
            present Majesty, cannot certainly
            conceive him
            a King of such slender and weak
            abilities,
            as to permit Himself
            and Family to be ruined
            by those very methods,
            with which his Father was
            before him.</p>

            approved
            Writers,
            but from unquestioned Records,
            Book-Cases,
            Acts
            of Parliament, and such further
            Arguments,
            as may be able to evince the point which we have in hand.</p>
          <p>But first perhaps it may be said,
            that there is
            no such difference in truth and verity betwixt a Lord of
            Parliament and a <hi>Peer of the Realm,</hi> but that we may
            conclude the the Bishops
            to be <hi>Peers
            of the Realm,</hi> if they be once
            admitted
            to be Lords
            of Parliament:
            concerning
            which take this from Chief Justice <hi>Coke,</hi> where he
            affirms
            that only a Lord of Parliament shall be
            tryed
            by his <hi>Peers,</hi>
            being
            Lords
            of Parliament, and neither
            Noblemen
            of any other Countrey,
            nor others that are called
            <hi>Lords</hi>
            and are no Lords
            of Parliament, are accounted
            <hi>Peers,</hi>
            that is
            to say <hi>Peers</hi>
            within this Statute (he meaneth
            the <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) or Great Charter of
            <hi>England,</hi> the ground of all our
            Laws
            and Liberties
            to this very day) by which it seems
            that he conceived
            a <hi>Peer</hi> and a Lord of Parliament to be
            terms
            equivalent: every <hi>Peer of the Realm</hi>
            being
            a Lord of Parliament,
            and every Lord of Parliament a <hi>Peer of the Realm,</hi>
            which clearly
            takes
            away the pretended
            difference that is
            made
            between them.</p>
          <p>But secondly,
            admit the distinction to be sound and solid, yet it will
            easily
            be proved
            that Bishops
            are not only Lords
            of Parliament, but <hi>Peers
            of the Realm.</hi> In order whereunto we must take notice of
            some passages
            in our former Treatise, touching
            the Bishops
            place and Vote in Parliament, that
            is
            to say, that from the first planting
            of the Gospel in the Realms
            of <hi>England,</hi> parcelled
            at that time amongst several Kings,
            the Bishops
            always
            had
            the principal place in their Common
            Councils,
            which the <hi>Saxons</hi>
            call by the name of <hi>Wittenegemote,</hi> or the
            <hi>Assembly
            of wise men,</hi>
            and afterwards
            in the time of the <hi>Normans,</hi>
            took
            the name of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            In all which Interval from <hi>Ethelbert</hi>
            the first Christian King of <hi>Kent</hi> in the year of our
            Lord 605. till the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor,
            which happened
            in the year 1066, no Common Council of the
            <hi>Saxons</hi>
            had
            been
            held
            without them,
            and all this while they held
            their Courts
            by no other Tenures
            than <hi>pur  perpetu Eleemosyn</hi>
            (<hi>franke
            Almoigne</hi> as our Lawyers
            call it) discharged
            from all Attendances
            upon secular Services.
            And therefore they could sit there in no other Capacity, than
            <hi>ratione officii  spiritualis Dignitatis,</hi> in
            regard of their Episcopal function; which as it
            raised
            them
            to an
            height of eminence
            in the eye of the people, so it
            was
            probably
            presumed
            that they were
            better qualified
            than the rest of the Subjects
            (as the times
            then were)
            for Governing
            the great Affairs
            of the Common-wealth.</p>
          <p>
            But when the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueror
              had
              attained
              the Crown, he thought it an
              improvident
              Course to suffer so much of the
              Lands
              of the Nation as then belonged
              unto
            
            
            
            the Prelates
              (whether Bishops
              or Abbots)
              in the Right of their Churches
              to be discharged
              from doing
              service to the State: And therefore he
              ordained
              them
              to hold their Lands
              <hi>sub militari servitute,</hi> either <hi>in Capite,</hi>
              or by <hi>Baronage,</hi> or some such
              military hold
              whereby they were
              compellable to aid the Kings
              in all times
              of War, with Men,
              Arms,
              and Horses,
              as the Lay-subjects
              of the same Tenure were
              required
              to do. Concerning
              which our Learned
              Antiquary out of <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>
              informs
              us thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            
            <hi>Rex enim Gulielmus Episcopatus,  Abbatias, quae
              Baronias tenebant in pur 
              perpetu
              Eleemosyn,  catenus ab omni servitute militari
              libertatem habuerunt, sub servitute statuit militari,
              Irrotulans singulos Episcopos,  Abbatias pro voluntate
              sua, quot milites sibi  successoribus hostilitatis
              tempore  singulis voluit exhiberi.</hi> Which though
              at first it was
              conceived
              to be a great Disfranchisement, and
              an
              heavy burden to the Prelacy, yet <hi>Cambden</hi> very well
              observes
              that it conduced
              at last to their greater
              honour in
              giving
              them
              a further Title to their place in Parliament, a claim to all
              the Rights
              of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and less obnoxious to
              Disputes,
              if considered
              rightly,
              than that which formerly
              they could pretend to: so that from this time
              forwards
              we must look upon them
              in all <hi>English</hi> Parliaments
              not only as Bishops
              in the <hi>Church,</hi> but as <hi>Peers</hi>
              and <hi>Barons
              of the Realm;</hi> of the same Tenure, and therefore of the
              same preheminence
              with the Temporal Lords.
              Which certainly
              must be the Reason that the Bishops
              of the Isle of <hi>Man</hi> are not
              called
              to Parliament, because they hold not of the King by
              Barony, as the
              rest of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops
              do, but hold the whole Estate in
              Lands
              from the Earl of <hi>Darby.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus also saith
              a Learned
              Lawyer,
            
            Every Arch-bishoprick
              and Bishoprick
              in <hi>England</hi>
              are of the Kings
              foundation, and holden
              of the King <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> and many
              Abbots,
              and Priors
              of Monasteries
              were
              also of the Kings
              foundation, and did
              hold of him
              <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> and in this Right the
              Arch-bishops,
              and Bishops,
              and such of the Abbots,
              and Priors
              as held
              <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> and were
              called
              by Writ to Parliament, were
              Lords
              of Parliament. And yet not Lords
              of Parliament only, but <hi>Peers
              and Barons
              of the Realm,</hi> as he shall call
              them
              very shortly
              on another occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the mean time we may observe that by this
              changing
              of their Tenure, the Bishops
              frequently
              were
              comprehended
              in the name of <hi>Barons,</hi>
              and more particularly
              in that passage of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
            
            where it is
              said
              <hi>Comites,  Barones
              non amercientur nisi per pares suos,</hi> that
              Earls
              and Barons
              are not to be amerced
              but by their <hi>Peers;</hi>
              concerning
              which the said
              Great Lawyer tells
              us thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That though this Statute (as he
              calls
              it) be in the negative, yet long use
              hath
              prevailed
              against it, for now the Amerciament
              of the Nobility is
              reduced
              to a certainty, <hi>viz.</hi> a Duke 10 <hi>l.</hi>
              an
              Earl 5 <hi>l.</hi> a Bishop that
              hath
              a Barony 5 <hi>l.</hi> where plainly
              Bishops
              must be comprehended
              in the name of <hi>Barons,</hi>
              and be amerced
              by their <hi>Peers,</hi>
              as the Barons
              were;
              though afterwards
              their Amerciaments
              be reduced
              to a certainty, as well as those of
              Earls,
              and Barons
              in the times
              succeeding.
              And then if Bishops
              be included
              in the name of <hi>Barons,</hi>
              and could not be legally
              amerced
              but by their <hi>Peers</hi>
              (as neither could the Earls
              or Barons
              by the words
              of this Charter) it must needs
              follow that the Bishops
              were
              accounted
              <hi>Peers,</hi>
              as well as any either of the Earls
              or Barons
              by whom
              they were
              to be Amerced.
              And for the next place we may behold the
              Constitutions
              made
              at <hi>Clarendon</hi> the tenth
              year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d.
            
            <hi>Anno</hi> 1164. in which it
              was
              declared
              as followeth,
              <hi>viz. Archiepiscopi, Episcopi,  universae personae
              Regni qui Rege tenent in Capite, habeant
              possessiones
              suos de Rege sicut Baroniam,  inde respondeant
              Justiciariis,  Ministris Regis,  sicut caeteri
              Barones,
              debent interesse Curiae Regis cum Baronibus quousque
              perventum sit ad diminutionem membrorum, vel ad mortem.</hi>
              Where first I think that those words
              <hi>universae
              personae</hi> are to be understood
              of none but Ecclesiastical persons
              (according
              to the notion of the word <hi>persona</hi> in the Common
              Law) and so to comprehend the Regular
              Clergy as well as the Arch-bishops,
              and Bishops.
              But secondly,
              if we must understand
              it of the Laity also, it must needs
              follow thereupon, that all which
              held
              their Lands
              of the Crown <hi>in Capite</hi>
              were
              capable in those times
              of a place in Parliament.
              And so it seems
              they had
              in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> and
              afterwards
              in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, but in the last
              years
              of the said
              King <hi>Henry,</hi> and by the power and prudence of King
              <hi>Edward</hi> the first, were
              brought
              into a narrower
              compass, none
              being
              admitted
              to appear, and attend in Parliament, but such as he thought
              fit to summon by his Royal Mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            And hereunto as well our choicest
              Antiquaries,
              as our most eminent Lawyers
              do consent unanimously.
              But here is
              to be noted
              (saith
              Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi>) that if the King give
              Lands
              to any one <hi>tenendum per servitium Baronis de Rege,</hi>
              he is
              no Lord of
            
            
            Parliament till he be called
              by Writ to the Parliament; which as he there
              declares
              for a point of Law, so is
              it also verified
              in point of practice, out of the old Record
              entituled
              <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> in which it
              is
              affirmed,
              <hi>Ad Parliamentum, summoniri,
               venire debere Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Abbates,
              Priores,  alios majores Cleri, qui tenent per
              Comitatum, aut Baroniam, ratione hujusmodi Tenurae,</hi>
              that all Arch-bishops,
              Bishops,
              Priors,
              and other Prelates
              of the Church, who hold their Lands
              either in right of their Counties,
              or in right of their Baronages,
              were
              to be summoned,
              and come to Parliament in regard of their
              Tenures.
              Where we may see that though they
              had
              a <hi>jus ad rem</hi> in regard of their
              Tenures,
              yet they had
              no pretence to their <hi>Jus in re</hi> but only by the Writ
              of Summons.
              And secondly
              whereas the <hi>Modus</hi> speaks
              of some Bishops
              which were
              to be called
              to the Parliament in the right of their
              Counties,
              I think he means
              it of the Bishops
              of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> which
              enjoyed
              all the Rights,
              and priviledges
              of a County Palatine in their several
              Circuits.
              By which we see that to the making
              of a Baron, or a Lord of Parliament, it
              is
              not only necessary that he hold by Barony, but that he have
              his Writ of Summons
              to attend the service which puts
              a signal difference between Lords
              of Parliament, and such as are called
              <hi>Lords</hi>
              in respect of
              their birth, or in regard of some great
              Offices
              which they hold in the State; of the first sort whereof are
              all the eldest
              sons
              of Earls
              and upwards,
              who are not only honoured
              with the name of <hi>Lords,</hi>
              but challenge a precedence by the
              Rules
              of Herauldry
              before all the Barons
              of the Realm, and yet can lay no claim to the
              Rights
              of <hi>Peerage,</hi> unless perhaps they may be
              summoned
              to the Parliament in their fathers
              life time. And so it hapned
              in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> the
              eldest
              son of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Duke of
              <hi>Norfolk,</hi> arraigned
              in the last days
              of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth,
              and tried
              by a Jury of twelve men,
              because not being
              called
              to Parliament in his fathers
              life-time, he could not be considered
              as a <hi>Peer</hi> of the Realm. And in the last sort we may
              reckon the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord
              Privy Seal, the Lord President of his
              Majesties
              Council, the Lord High Chamberlain, the Lord
              Admiral, the
              Lord Steward, and the Lord Chamberlain of his
              Majesties
              Houshold,
              the Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports,
              and the three Chief Judges,
              who if they be not otherwise of the Rank of
              Barons,
              can plead no Title to their <hi>Peerage,</hi> nor to Vote in
              Parliament; and so it hapned
              in the Case of Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi>
              Lord Chamberlain
              to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh,
              tried
              by a Jury of twelve men
              in a case of Treason without relation to his great Office or
              Title of <hi>Lord.</hi> Most true it
              is,
              that some of these great Officers
              have their place in Parliament, and so have all the
              Judges
              of the Courts
              of <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Master of the
              Rolls,
              the Masters
              of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Kings
              Attorney General, and perhaps some others; all
              summoned
              to attend the service by Especial
              Writs,
              but they are only called
              to advise the Court to give their
              Judgment
              and Opinion when it is
              demanded,
              but not to canvass,
              or debate, and much less to conclude in any business which
              is
              there discoursed
              of, as both the Bishops
              and the Temporal Lords
              are impowred
              to do. Which difference appears
              in the Writs
              themselves.
              For in the Writ of Summons
              to the Judges,
              and the rest here mentioned,
              the words
              run thus, <hi>viz. Quod intersitis nobiscum,  cum
              caeteris de concilio nostro,</hi> (and
              sometimes
              <hi>nobiscum</hi> only) <hi>supra praemissis tractaturi,
              vestrumque consilium impensuri.</hi> But in the Writ of
              Summons
              to the Bishops
              and the rest of the <hi>Peers,</hi>
              we shall find it thus, <hi>viz. quod intersitis cum
              praelatis, magnatibus,  proceribus super dictis
              negotiis tractaturi, vestrum{que} consilium impensuri,
              c.</hi> which Writs
              of Summons
              to the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
              and the Temporal <hi>Peers,</hi>
              are the same <hi>verbatim;</hi> but that the
              Bishops
              are required
              to attend the service <hi>sub fide, 
              dilectione,</hi>
              the Temporal Peers
              <hi>sub fide,  ligeantia, quibus nobis tenemini.</hi>
              Upon which Premises
              it may be rationally
              inferred,
              that the Bishops
              of this Church were
              reputed
              Barons,
              (a Baron and a Barony being
              <hi>conjugata</hi>) and being
              Barons
              have as good a Claim to the right of <hi>Peerage</hi> as any
              of the Temporal Lords,
              who hold as well their Peerage as their place in Parliament
              by no other Tenure; for that a Baron of Realm, and a
              <hi>Peer</hi> of the Realm are but
              terms
              synonymous, and that the Bishops
              of the the Church of <hi>England</hi> are both
              <hi>Peers</hi>
              and Barons
              hath
              been
              proved
              before, and may be further evidenced
              from that which they affirmed
              to the Temporal Lords
              convened
              in Parliament at <hi>Northampton</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi>
              the 2d, for the determining
              of the differences
              betwixt the King and <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Arch bishop of
              <hi>Canterbury;</hi> which the Temporal
              Lords
              would fain have thrust upon the
              Bishops,
              as more competent Judges,
              to which the Bishops
              thus replied,
              <hi>viz. non sedemus hic Episcopi, sed
              Barones,
              nos Barones,
              vos Barones,</hi>
              Pares <hi>hic sumus;</hi> We sit not here say they as
              Bishops
              only,
            
            but as Barons
              also, we are Barons
              and you are Barons,
              here we sit as <hi>Peers.</hi>
              Their sitting
              in
            
            
            
            the Parliament was
              in a right of their Baronies.
              And in the right of their Baronage they
              were
              also <hi>Peers,</hi>
              and <hi>Peers</hi>
              to all intents
              and purposes
              as well as any others, (whether
              Earls
              or Barons)
              who had
              Vote in Parliament. This appears
              further by the words
              of Arch-bishop <hi>Stratford,</hi> who
              being
              suspended
              from his place in Parliament by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d,
              came
              boldly
              to the Doors
              of the House, and turning
              towards
              those that attended
              there, thus maintained
              his Claim, <hi>Amice Rex, me ad hoe
              Parliamentum
              scripto sua vocavit,</hi>
            
            <hi> ego tanquam major</hi> Par <hi>regni post Regem
               primam vocem habere debens in Parliamento, Jura
              Ecclesiae meae Cantuariensis vendico  ideo Ingressum in
              Parliamentum peto.</hi> Which makes
              it plain, that the Arch-bishop did
              not challenge a place in Parliament, as the first Peer of
              the Realm, and one that ought to have the first Voice in all
              <hi>English</hi> Parliaments,
              either by way of favour or of Custom only, but as a power,
              and priviledg
              which he ought to have (<hi>habere debeus</hi> as the
              words
              are) in right of his See.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proceed we to the Case of <hi>John</hi>
              Bishopp
              of <hi>Winchester</hi> in the reign of the
              said
              King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, who
              having
              departed
              from the Parliament without leave from the King,
              was
              for the same accused,
              and prosecuted
              at the Kings
              Suit, by one <hi>Adam de Fincham</hi> his
              Majesties
              Attorney or Sollicitor
              General, to which Action the Bishop
              did
              appear, and put in his plea, in which he doth maintain
              himself to be a <hi>Peer of the Realm,</hi> and therefore to
              be tried
              by Parliament for the said
              offence, which in a time of Parliament
              was
              committed
              by him.
              But take the whole Record with you for the more assurance,
            <q>
              <hi>Et praedictus Episcopus in propri person
                su venit  defendit omnem contemptum, 
                transgressionem.  quicquid, c.  dicit quod
                ipse sit unus de</hi> Paribus regni, <hi> Praelatus
                saerosanctae Ecclesiae,  Jus venire ad Parliamentum

              <hi> pro voluntate ipsius Domini Regis cum sibi
                placuerit,  dicit quod si quis eorum erga Dominum
                regem in Parliamento aliquo delinqueret, in Parliamento
                debet corrigi  emendari, in non alibi minori
                Curi.</hi>
            </q>
            And this Record proves
              plainly,
              that he challenged
              his Right of Peerage. Though by my Author it
              is
              brought
              for another
              purpose, that is
              to say, that misdemeanours
              and offences
              which are done
              in Parliament ought not to be enquired
              into, or punished
              in a lower Court, contrary to the power, and practice of the
              Kings
              of <hi>England</hi> in all times
              foregoing.
          </p>
          <p>Now that which was
            affirmed
            by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> in reference to his right
            of <hi>Peerage,</hi> was
            generally
            challenged
            by all the Bishops
            in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, on the
            impeachment of the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and some others
            in the Court of Parliament. At which time
            being
            to withdraw themselves by the Canon Law which
            had
            prohibited
            all Clergy-men
            from intermedling
            in <hi>Causa sanguinis,</hi> they
            made

            </q>
          </p>
          <p>In which Record we may observe, First, that the
            Bishops
            and the rest there mentioned
            held
            their Lands
            by Baronage; Secondly,
            that they were
            sommoned
            to the Parliament in regard of their
            Tenures;
            Thirdly,
            that being
            called
            to serve in Parliament,
            they sat there as <hi>Peers,</hi>
            and gave
            their Counsel in all matters
            and affairs
            of moment, which were
            therein handled;
            Fourthly,
            that though to testifie
            their obedience
            to some Canons
            which were
            then in force, they did
            withdraw their personal presence at the time of Trial, yet
            they did
            it with a <hi>salvo Jure Paritatis,</hi> not to infringe the
            rights
            and priviledges
            which belonged
            unto them
            in regard of their <hi>Peerage.</hi> And
            finally
            we may observe, that this Protestation
            is
            not only extant in the <hi>Antiquitates Britannicae</hi> (to
            which the Margent doth refer us) but at the desire of the
            said
            Prelates,
            the good leave of the King, and the consent of all the
            Peers,
            which were
            there assembled,
            it was
            entred
            in the Journal of the House of Peers,
            where it still continues.</p>
          <p>
            But because possibly
              the Bishops
              may claim more than belongs
              unto them,
              or that perhaps their Testimony may not be
              admitted
              in matters
              of their own concernment, we will next see what
              is
              affirmed
              by others as to that particular. And first we will begin
              with the Learned
              <hi>Cambden,</hi> who informeth
              us thus, <hi>viz. Ad quos Abbates</hi>
              (having
              first reckoned
              them
              according
              to their Names,
            
            and Order) <hi>ut etiamnuin ad Episcopos
              Parliamentis
              quibuscun{que} ut</hi> Pares regni <hi>cum</hi> caeteris
              Paribus <hi>personaliter interesse,
              consulere, tractare, ordinare, statuere, definire ratione
              Baroniarum, quas de Rege tenebant,
              de Jure  consuetudine spectavit:</hi> for proof
              whereof, besides
              the Credit of the Auther, we are by
              him
              referred
              to the publick
              Acts
              or Records
              of Parliament, but unto what Records
              particularly
              he informs
              us not.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore we nust help our selves
              by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> who
              tells
              us,
            
            out of the Records
              of Parliament, and in his Margent
              pointing
              to the 13th of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, doth instruct
              us thus, <hi>viz. Abbates, Priores, alios{que} Praelatos
              quoscun{que} per Baroniam de Domino Rege tenentes pertinet
              in Parliamentis
              Regni quibuscunq, ut</hi> pates <hi>Regni praedicti
              personaliter interesse, ibi{que} de Regni negotiis ac aliis
              tractari consuetis cum caeteris dicti Regni</hi> Paribus
               aliis <hi>ibidem jus interessendi habentibus
              consulere,  tractare, ordinare, statuere 
              definire, ac caetera facere, quae Parliamenti tempore
              imminent facienda;</hi>
              Which if it be the same with that which we
              had
              before, differing
              only in some words
              (as perhaps it is)
              yet we have gained
              the Testimony of that Learned
              Lawyer, whose judgment
              in this Case must be worth the having.
          </p>
          <p>
            For hear him
              speaking
              in his own words
              and he tells
              us this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            
            That every Lord of Parliament either Spiritual, as
              Arch-bishops,
              and Bishops,
              or Temporal as Dukes,
              Marquesses,
              Earls,
              Viscounts,
              and Barons,
              <hi>Peers
              of the Realm,</hi> and Lords
              of Parliament
              ought to have several Writs
              of Summons,
              where plainly
              these words,
              <hi>Peers</hi>
              and Lords
              of Parliament relate as well to Spiritual, as to the
              Temporal Lords.
              And therefore if the Arch-bishops,
              and the Bishops
              may be granted
              to be Lords
              of Parliament,
              they must be also granted
              to be <hi>Peers
              of the Realm.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to the Testimony, and Authority of particular
              persons,
              we shall next add the sentence and determination of our
              Courts
              of Law, in which the Bishops
              are declared
              to be <hi>Peers
              of the Realm,</hi> and to be capable of all the
              priviledges,
              which belong to
              the <hi>Peerage.</hi> For first in the aforesaid Case of the
              Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> when he
              was
              brought
              upon his Trial for departing
              from the service of the Parliament
              without leave
              of the King, and pleaded
              sor himself, <hi>quod esset unus </hi> Paribus
              <hi>Regni,</hi> c.
            
            It was
              supposed
              clearly,
              both by Court and Council that he
              was
              a <hi>Peer,</hi> that part of his defence
              being
              not gainsayed,
              or so much, as questioned.
          </p>
          <p>So in the Year-Books
            of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, in whose Reign
            the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>'s Case
            was
            agitated
            (as before is
            said)
            a Writ of Wards
            was
            brought
            by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and by
            him
            pleaded
            to an
            Issue, and the Defendant could not be
            <hi>Essoyned,</hi>
            or have day of Grace, for it was
            said
            that a Bishop was
            a <hi>Peer</hi> of the Land, <hi>haec erat causa,</hi>
            saith
            the Book, which reports
            the Case.</p>
          <p>In the like Case upon an
            <hi>Action of Trespass</hi> against the Abbot of
            <hi>Abbingdon,</hi>
            who was
            one of the Lords
            Spiritual, day of Grace was
            denied
            against him
            because he was
            a <hi>Peere
            de la Terre.</hi></p>
          <p>So also it is
            said
            expresly,
            that when question was
            made
            about the returning
            of a Knight to be of a Jury where a Bishop
            was
            Defendant in a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> the Rule of the Court
            was,
            that it ought to be so, because the Bishop
            was
            a <hi>Peer of the Realm.</hi></p>
          
          
          
          <p>And in the Judgment
            given
            against the Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> in the time of
            <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, he is
            in the Roll expresly
            allowed
            to be a <hi>Peer;</hi> for he had
            taken
            exceptions
            that some things
            had
            passed
            against him
            without the Assent, or knowledg
            of his <hi>Peers
            of the Realm.</hi> To which Exception it
            was
            Answered,
            that it behoved
            him
            not at all to plead that he was
            a Prelate, for traversing
            such Errors
            and misprisions,
            as in the quality of a Souldier,
            who had
            taken
            wages
            of the King, were
            committed
            by him.</p>
          <p>Thus also in the Assignment of the
            Errors
            under <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, for the Reversal of the
            Attainder of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> one Error
            is
            assigned
            that Judgment
            was
            given
            without the consent of the Prelates
            which were
            <hi>Peers
            in Parliament.</hi> And although
            that was
            adjudged
            to be no Error, yet was
            it clearly
            allowed
            both in the Roll, and the Petitions,
            that the Bishops
            were
            <hi>Peers.</hi></p>
          <p>Finally
            in the Government of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> the
            Bishops
            did
            not only pass in the Ranks
            of <hi>Peers,</hi>
            but six of them
            were
            taken
            into the number of the <hi>Douze-pairs</hi>
            or <hi>twelve Peers</hi>
            of that Kingdom, highly
            esteemed
            and celebrated
            in the times
            of <hi>Charlemayne,</hi>
            that is
            to say, the Arch-bishop and Duke of
            <hi>Rhemes;</hi>
            the Bishop and Duke of <hi>Laon,</hi> the Bishop and Duke of
            <hi>Langres;</hi> the Bishop and Earl of <hi>Beuvois,</hi> the
            Bishop and Earl of <hi>Noyon,</hi> the Bishop and Earl of
            <hi>Chalons.</hi> And therefore it may be
            inferred,
            that in the Government established
            by the <hi>Anjovin</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
            Kings,
            the <hi>English</hi>
            Bishops
            might be ranked
            with the <hi>Peers</hi>
            at large, considering
            their place in Parliament,
            and their great Revenues,
            and the strong influence which they
            had
            on the Church and State.</p>
          <p>
            But there is
              little need for Inferences,
              and book-Cases,
              and the Authorities
              of particular men
              to come in for Evidence, when we are able to produce
              an
              Act of Parliament
              to make good the point. For in the Statute
              made
              the 4th year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, it
              was
              repeated
              and confirmed,
            <q>That no man of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation should be
              chosen
              by Election to be an
              Arch-bishop, Bishop, Abbot, or Frior, nor in no other manner
              received
              or accepted
              to any dignity and benefice within the
              said
              Land, <hi>c.</hi> The Reason of which inhibition
              is
              there said
              to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> because
              being
              <hi>Peers
              of the Parliament</hi> of the said
              Land, they brought
              with them
              to the Parliaments,
              and Councils
              holden
              there some <hi>Irish</hi> servants,
              whereby the privities
              of the <hi>Englishmen</hi>
              within the same Land have been,
              and be daily discovered
              to the <hi>Irish</hi> people, (Rebels
              to the King) to the great peril and mischief of the
              Kings
              lawful Liege people in the said
              Land.</q>
            And if the Bishops
              and Arch-bishops
              of <hi>Ireland</hi> had
              the name of <hi>Peers,</hi>
              there is
              no question to be made,
              but the name of <hi>Peers,</hi>
              and the right of <hi>Peerage</hi> may
              properly
              be assumed
              or challenged
              by them.
          </p>
          <p>Now as this Statute gives
            them
            the name of <hi>Peers,</hi>
            so in an
            Act of Parliament in the 25th year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
            8th, they are called
            the Nobles
            of your Realm, as well Spiritual as Temporal, as all your
            other Subjects
            now living,
            <hi>c.</hi> Which Term we find again
            repeated
            by the Parliament following,
            <hi>the Nobles
            Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> and that twice for
            failing;
            so that we find no Title given
            to Earls
            and Barons,
            <hi>Nobles
            and Peers,
            and Lords</hi>
            as the Statutes
            call them,
            but what is
            given
            to the Bishops
            in our Acts
            of Parliament, and certainly
            had
            not been
            given
            them
            in the stile of that Court, had
            any question then been
            made
            of their Right of <hi>Peerage;</hi> And that their
            calling
            had
            not raised
            them
            to a state of Nobility; concerning
            which take this from the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi> for
            our more assurance, and he will tell us that the general
            division of persons
            by the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
            is
            either one that is
            Noble, and in respect of his nobility
            of the Lords
            House of Parliament, or one of the
            Commons
            of the Realm, and in respect thereof of the House of
            Commons
            in Parliament.</p>
          <p>
            Next to the Parliament the most
              renowned
              Judicatory of this Land, is
              the <hi>Great Council of the Peers,</hi>
              called
              by the King on sudden and emergent
              occasions
              which cannot
              safely
              stay the leisure of a Parliament, for the
              prescribing
              of such remedies
              as the case requires;
              and called
              so for no other reason, but that it
              is
              a general meeting
              of the Bishops
              and Temporal Lords,
              under the common name of <hi>Peers,</hi>
              to give the King such Counsel and advice in his
              greatest
              difficulties,
              as the exigencies
              of affairs
              shall suggest unto them;
              which proves
              the Bishops
              to be <hi>Peers,</hi>
              as well as any of the Temporal
              Lords.
              Nor could it properly
              be called
              the <hi>Great Council of Peers,</hi>
              if any but the <hi>Peers</hi>
              be invited
              to it. The last example of which Council
              was
              that held
              at <hi>York,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>September,
              Anno</hi> 1640. upon the breaking
              in of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Rebels.
              And the like Argument may be drawn
              from that Appellation, which commonly
              is
              given
              to that place, or Room wherein the
              Lords
              Spiritual and Temporal do consult
            
            
            together in the times
              of Parliament, best known
              unto us by the name of the <hi>House of
              Peers,</hi>
              and known
              unto us by that name for no other Reason, but because it
              is
              appropriated
              to the use of the <hi>Peers</hi>
              (that is
              to say, the <hi>Nobles
              Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> or the
              Bishops
              and the Temporal Lords)
              for their Consultations.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as they have the name of <hi>Peers</hi>
              and the Rights
              of <hi>Peerage,</hi> so is
              there none of all the Antient
              Rights
              of <hi>Peerage,</hi> which belong not to
              them
              as fully
              and as amply
              as to any of the Temporal Lords,
              that is
              to say, a necessary place and Vote in
              Parliament,
              and a particular Writ of Summons
              to invite them
              to it, the freedom of their persons
              from Arrests
              at the suit of a Subject, not to be
              troubled
              with <hi>Essoynes</hi>
              or supplicavits
              in the Courts
              of Justice, a power to qualifie
              their Chaplains
              to hold several Benefices,
              not to have any Action against them
              tried
              except one Knight at the least be
              returned
              of the Pannel; the Liberty of killing
              one, or more of the Kings
              Deer in any of his Parks
              or Chases,
              both in their going
              to the Parliament, and returning
              home, of which take this in General from our
              Learned
              Antiquary,
            
            <hi>Inde Ecclesiastici
              illi omnibus, quibus caeteri Regni
              Barones
              gavisi sunt immunitatibus nisi quod </hi> Paribus
              <hi>non judicentur;</hi> that is
              to say, that they enjoy all priviledges,
              and Immunities,
              as the Lay Lords
              do, but that they are not to be
              Judged
              by their <hi>Peers.</hi>
              But first he is
              not certain that this exception (their not
              being
              to be Judged
              by their <hi>Peers</hi>)
              will hold good in Law, and therefore
              leaves
              the resolution of that point to our
              Learned
              Lawyers,
              <hi>sed an
              hoc sit Juris explorati dixerint ipsi Juris periti,</hi> as
              his own words
              are. And secondly,
              the reason which he gives
              is
              no more than this, that since by reason of the
              Canons,
              they could not be Judges
              or Assessors
              <hi>in causa sanguinis,</hi> they therefore
              were
              referred
              to a Common Jury of twelve Men
              in all publick
              Trials;
              but by this reason they must either have no Trial at all, or
              may as well be tried
              by their <hi>Peers,</hi>
              as a Common Jury, because they are
              disabled
              by those Canons
              from sitting
              in Judgment
              on the life of a Common Juror as well as of a Lord, or
              <hi>Peer,</hi> which I marvail
              <hi>Cambden</hi> did
              not see.
          </p>
          <p>But weaker
            is
            the Reason which is
            given
            by <hi>Stamford</hi> in his Pleas
            of the Crown, that is
            to say, that Bishops
            are not to be tried
            by their <hi>Peers,</hi>
            because they do not hold their place in Parliament <hi>Ratione
            Nobilitatis, sed ratione officii:</hi> and yet not only in
            regard of their
            Office <hi>eien en respect de lour
            possessions,
            l'antient Baronyes
            annexes
            a lour dignitye,</hi>
            but in regard of their possessions,
            and those ancient Baronies
            which are annexed
            to their Sees,
            which reason in my Judgment
            hath
            no reason at all, for then the old
            Barons
            which were
            called
            to Parliament in regard of their Tenure (as they
            were
            all until the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d) could have
            no Trial by their <hi>Peers,</hi>
            because they had
            no place in Parliament, but in respect of their
            possessions,
            or temporal
            Baronies;
            and secondly,
            the Bishops
            as before was
            proved,
            are accounted
            <hi>Nobles,</hi>
            and thereupon may challenge their place in Parliament, not
            only <hi>ratione officii,</hi> (as
            anciently
            before the times
            of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror) but also <hi>ratione
            Nobilitatis;</hi> since they were
            ranked
            amongst the <hi>Barons</hi>
            in regard of their Tenure.</p>
          <p>Others perhaps may give this reason, that
            Bishops
            in the former times
            were
            debarred
            from Marriage, and that now holding
            their Estates
            and Honours
            only for term of life, they are not capable of
            transmitting
            either unto their posterity, which
            possibly
            may make the Laws
            less tender of them
            than they might be otherwise; but then what shall we say of
            the Wives
            and Widows
            of the Temporal Lords,
            who being
            either barren, or
            past hope of Children
            shall notwithstanding be tried
            by their <hi>Peers</hi>
            according
            to the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth; Or put the case
            that any man should be created
            Earl or Baron for the time of his life, or with a limitation
            to the Heirs
            of his body; and either live unmarried
            or continue childless; must he be therefore
            made
            incapable of a Trial by the <hi>Peers
            of the Realm,</hi> because his Honours
            and his Life do expire together.
            I think no reasonable man can say it, and I hope none
            will.</p>
          <p>
            It cannot be denied
              but that some Bishops
              have been
              tried
              by Common Juries,
              that is
              to say <hi>Adam de Orlton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,
              Thomas Lyld</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely, Thomas
              Merkes</hi>
              Bishop of <hi>Carslile, John Fisher</hi> Bishop of
              <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi>
              Archbishop
              of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but then it
              is
              to be observed,
              that none but <hi>Fisher</hi> suffered
              death on that account, whether by reason of some illegality
              in their proceedings,
              or in reference
              to their High and holy Callings
              it is
              hard to say; And secondly
              we may observe,
              that though in some confusions
              and disorder of times
              such Presidents
              may be produced
              as in matter of Fact, yet the Case
              is
              not altogether so clear in point of Law, as not to leave the
              matter doubtful, as we heard
              before; and that it was
              conceived
            
            
            
            by some Learned
              men
              of that profession, that if those
              Bishops
              had
              desired
              to be tryed
              by their <hi>Peers,</hi>
              it could not have been
              denied
              them
              in a course of Justice.
          </p>
          <p>And therefore thirdly,
            we observe that the Bishops
            of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi>
            did
            trust so much to their dependance
            on the Pope, and their exemption from the power of all secular
            Judges,
            that they refused
            absolutely
            to be tryed
            by any but the Archbishop
            of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as the Popes
            Legate in this Kingdom, which possibly
            might put their Enemies
            upon a course of enquiring
            into their offences
            by a Common Jury, the parties
            being
            wilfully
            absent and not submitting
            to a Trial in due course of Law; and that the way
            being
            thus laid
            open, it was
            no hard matter to make the Bishop of <hi>Carlisle</hi>
            obnoxious to that kind of Trial, which
            being
            forsaken
            on all sides
            (as the times
            then were)
            he was
            not able to avoid.</p>
          <p>Which might be also the condition of Arch-bishop
            <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and as for <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of
            <hi>Rochester</hi> he was
            to deal with an
            impetuous and violent Prince, who
            was
            resolved
            to put the greater
            disgrace upon him,
            because he had
            received
            some greater
            Honours
            from the Pope, than the condition of
            Affairs
            might be thought to bear.</p>
          <p>But against all these violations
            of their Rights
            of <hi>Peerage,</hi> it may be said
            in their behalves
            for the times
            to come, that by the Statute of the 25th of King
            <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, which serves
            to this day for the standing
            Rule in Cases
            of Treason, it is
            required
            that the Malefactor, or the suspected
            person must be attainted
            by such men,
            as are of <hi>his own Condition,</hi> and therefore
            Bishops
            to be tryed
            by none; but the <hi>Peers
            of the Land,</hi> unless it be in open
            opposit
            on to this Rule of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and in
            defiance to the
            fundamental Law in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> where it
            is
            said,
            that no man is
            to be Disseised
            of his Freehold, exiled,
            or any ways
            destroyed;
            <hi>nisi per</hi> Judicium parium
            suorum; Or <hi>per Legem Terrae,</hi> but by the
            Judgment
            of his Peers,
            and by the Law of the Land, and I can find no Law of the Land
            which tells
            me that a Bishop shall be tryed
            by a Common Jury.</p>
          <p>Finally,
            if it be a sufficient Argument, that
            Bishops
            ought not to be reckoned
            as <hi>Peers
            of the Realm,</hi> because they may be
            tryed
            by a Common Jury, then also at some
            times,
            and in certain Cases,
            the Temporal Lords,
            Dukes,
            Marquesses,
            Earls,
            c. must not pass for <hi>Peers,</hi>
            because in all Appeals
            of Murder, they are to be tryed
            by Common
            Jurors,
            like the rest of the Subjects.</p>
          <p>
            But secondly
              it is
              objected,
              That since a Bishop cannot sit in
              Judgment
              on the death of a <hi>Peer,</hi> nor be so much as present
              at the time of his Trial, they are but
              <hi>half-Peers</hi>
              as it were,
              not <hi>Peers</hi>
              to all intents
              and purposes,
              as the others are. But this incapacity
              is
              not laid
              upon them
              by the Laws
              of the Land, or any Limitation of their
              powers
              in their Writ of Summons,
              or any thing inhering
              to the Episcopal Function,
              but only by some ancient Canons,
              (and more particularly
              by the fourth Canon
              of <hi>Toledo</hi>) which, whether they be now of force or
              not may be somewhat questioned;
              Secondly,
              whensoever they withdrew
              themselves, they did
              it with a <hi>salvo Jure paritatis,</hi> as before
              is
              shewn.
              To which intent they did
              not only cause their Protestations
              to be filed
              on Record,
            
            but for the most part made
              a <hi>Proxy</hi> to some Temporal
              Lords
              to Act in their behalf, and preserve their right, which
              though they did
              not in the Case we had
              before us, yet afterwards
              in the 21st of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, and from that
              time forwards
              (when they found Parliamentary Impeachments
              to become more frequent) they observed
              it constantly
              as it continues
              to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor were
              they hindred
              by those Canons,
              whatsoever they were,
              from being
              present at the
              depositions
              of Witnesses,
              or taking
              such preparatory examinations
              as concern the
              Trial, in which they might be able to direct the Court (by
              the Rules
              of Conscience) though they withdrew
              themselves at the time of the sentence. That
              was
              a Trick imposed
              upon the Bishops
              by the late long Parliament, when they
              excluded
              them
              from being
              members
              of the Committee which was
              appointed
              for taking
              the examinations
              in the business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> And this
              they did
              not in relation to those ancient
              Canons,
              but upon design, for fear, they might discover some of those
              secret practices,
              which were
              to be hatched,
              and contrived
              against him.
              Against which Preparations
              for a final Trial, or taking
              the Examinations,
              or hearing
              of depositions
              of Witnesses,
              or giving
              counsel in such cases
              as they saw
              occasion; the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi>
              saith
              not any thing which can be honestly
              interpreted
              to their disadvantage. So that the
              Bishops
              Claim stands
              good to their
            
            
            right of <hi>Peerage,</hi> any thing in those ancient
              Canons,
              or the unjust practices
              of the late Long Parliament to the contrary notwithstanding.
          </p>
          <p>To draw the business to an
            end, what one thing is
            required
            unto the constituting
            of a <hi>Peer</hi> of <hi>England</hi> which
            is
            not to be found in an
            <hi>English Bishop,</hi> if <hi>Tenure</hi> and
            <hi>Estate?</hi>
            they hold their Lands
            <hi>per integram Baroniam,</hi> as the old
            Lords
            did;
            if Voice in Parliament? they have their several
            Writs
            of Summons
            as the Lay-Lords
            have; if we desire Antiquity to make good their Interesse?
            most of them
            have sat longer
            there in their Predecessors,
            than any of our Temporal Lords
            in their noblest
            Ancestors;
            if point of Priviledg?
            they have the same in all respects
            as the others have, except it be in one particular, neither
            clearly
            stated,
            nor universally
            enjoyed
            by those who pretend
            most to it; if Letters
            Patents
            from the King to confirm these Honours?
            they have his Majesties
            Writ of <hi>Conge
            d'eslire</hi> his Royal Assent to the Election, his Mandate
            under the Great
            Seal for their Consecration: If therefore we allow the
            Bishops
            to be Lords
            of Parliament, we must allow them
            also to be <hi>Peers
            of the Realm;</hi> There being
            nothing which distinguisheth
            a <hi>Peer</hi> from from a common Person, but his Voice in
            Parliament; which was
            the matter to be proved.</p>
